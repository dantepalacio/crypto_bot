Bitdeer grows Bitcoin production by 195% YoY with a 35% September increase in BTC mined;"Singapore-based Bitdeer Technologies Group revealed a notable surge in mined Bitcoins in September 2023.
482 Bitcoins were mined, nearly tripling the numbers from the same time last year. Additionally, the Gedu mining data center alone produced 217 Bitcoins, accounting for approximately 45% of the total mined Bitcoins in September.
The increase is primarily attributed to the company’s operational efficiency, strategic business focus, and the stable operations of its newly constructed Gedu mining data center in Bhutan.
Bitdeer CEO Linghui Kong emphasized the company’s operational strength, which yielded robust results, with Bitcoin mining through their self-mining business experiencing an impressive 25.8% increment compared to the previous month.
According to Kong, the firm’s self-mining success is due to Bitdeer maintaining its aggregate electrical capacity at a steady 895MW. Highlighting the broader implications of these operational efficiencies, Kong stated,
“As we move into the remainder of the year, we are confident that our emphasis on strategic business development will bolster our results and help us generate long-term value for our shareholders.”
Beyond self-mining, Bitdeer’s operations span across three main business lines. These include Hash Rate Sharing, primarily involving Cloud Hash Rate, where Bitdeer offers hash rate subscription plans and shares mining income with customers. Hosting is a comprehensive mining machine hosting solution inclusive of deployment, maintenance, and management services for efficient cryptocurrency mining.
Bitdeer’s operations update indicated that the total hash rate under management as of Sep. 30 was 21.2 EH/s across the three primary business lines, with the proprietary hash rate at 8.7 EH/s. Bitdeer has 221,000 mining machines under management.
Bitdeer is not only expanding its Bitcoin mining capabilities but also its infrastructure. The company is steadily constructing a 175MW immersion cooling data center at its mining facility in Tydal, Norway. This expansion is part of Bitdeer’s concerted efforts to enhance its infrastructure and expand capacity. Completion of the Tydal Datacenter is expected in 2025.
As an industry player, Bitdeer’s operational updates offer an insightful glimpse into the dynamics of the cryptocurrency mining industry. The firm’s focus on optimizing operations, expanding infrastructure, and engaging in strategic business development is the backbone of its growth, offering valuable lessons for other organizations in the crypto space.
With mining data centers deployed in the United States, Norway, and Bhutan, Bitdeer continues providing its customers with comprehensive digital asset mining solutions.

Bitcoin Stopped at $28K, Toncoin Explodes 9% Daily (Market Watch);"Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down the $28,000 mark but was quickly stopped in its tracks and has returned to $27,500.
Most altcoins are trading sideways, with ADA and SOL gaining a few percentages, while ETH and BNB have retraced slightly.
Bitcoin initiated a massive leg up at the start of the week after a slow weekend that drove it from $27,000 to a multi-week peak at $28,600. As the community was anticipating the restart of the bull run, the cryptocurrency started losing value.
In a matter of a day, the asset lost just over a grand and went back below $27,500 until Thursday. That’s when another offensive arrived, and BTC soared to just over $28,000.
Nevertheless, it failed to continue upwards once again. The subsequent rejection pushed it back down by nearly a grand this time. As a result, bitcoin currently trades at around $27,500.
Its market capitalization has lost some ground, expectedly, and is down below $540 billion on CMC. its dominance over the altcoins, on the other hand, has increased slightly to 49.6%.
As reported yesterday, Toncoin, which was a massive gainer at the end of September, had lost its momentum with the start of the new month. However, the trending altcoin has gone back on the offensive in the past 24 hours. TON is up by approximately 9%, which has helped it reclaim the $2 mark.
Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and Avalanche are also slightly in the green. In fact, AVAX has jumped by about 4% and now stands firmly above $10.
In contrast, ETH, BNB, XRP, and TRX have registered minor losses. Overall, though, most larger-cap alts are relatively stable on a daily scale.
Consequently, the total crypto market cap has remained still at around $1.080 trillion on CMC.

Assessing Cardano’s Struggles: Will Key Support Levels Halt The Decline Above $0.27?;"Cardano (ADA) has been on a rollercoaster ride in the cryptocurrency market, with its recent price recovery rally encountering some significant challenges. 
As of the latest data from CoinGecko, ADA is trading at $0.261, showing a modest 1.7% gain in the past 24 hours, but boasting a seven-day rally of 4.9%. However, beneath the surface, there are signs of growing overhead pressure that could limit ADA’s upward momentum.
ADA’s journey to reclaim its previous highs faces its first major hurdle at the $0.26 mark. But this is just the beginning, as multiple layers of resistance lie above it, signifying significant supplier congestion levels. The price recovery may be stalling due to these formidable barriers.
To gain a deeper understanding of ADA’s current price dynamics, we turn to a new price analysis. Data reveals a crucial level of buying interest at $0.25. In fact, over 600,000 ADA buy limit orders are placed at this level. 
This suggests that if ADA can breach the range-high and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), it might find support around the mid-range of $0.25.
On the sell side, key sell limit orders start to emerge between $0.265 and $0.270, indicating that there is substantial selling pressure just above the current price levels.

The fate of ADA’s price also hinges on Bitcoin’s performance. Should Bitcoin post losses and dip below $27,500, ADA could follow suit, potentially finding support at the mid-range of $0.25. Conversely, a bullish rally in Bitcoin could set the stage for ADA to re-target its next hurdle at $0.28.
Technical indicators are also raising caution flags for ADA investors. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50 level and trending downward, indicating fading momentum. Furthermore, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in negative territory, signaling a lack of bullish sentiment.

Considering the current market conditions and technical indicators, analysts are leaning towards a bearish outlook for Cardano’s price. There is a possibility that ADA could descend to test the support floor at $0.2415. In a worst-case scenario, the price could plummet further, potentially reaching the range low of $0.2200, marking a substantial 15% drop from its current levels.
While Cardano has shown resilience with its recent gains, the road ahead is riddled with resistance levels, and Bitcoin’s influence remains a significant factor. Investors should closely monitor the developments in ADA’s price, as it navigates through these challenging market conditions. The cryptocurrency landscape is as unpredictable as ever, and ADA’s journey is far from certain.

"Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025!";"The post Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The bitcoin price trend is no less than ‘hot pancakes’ which is gaining global attention. The rise or fall in price is not restricted to demand and supply, as the institutions and whales, along with the market makers, do have a significant impact on it. After the collapse of Terra & FTX, the markets appeared to be uncertain and not in recovery mode for the next few months. However, the emergence of institutions in the crypto space lifted the momentum, which made the market participants optimistic about the future growth of the BTC price and the entire market.
It’s more clear that Bitcoin is fueling up for one of the most phenomenal runs in history. The major reason for being bullish on Bitcoin could be:
Considering these factors, industry experts believe the BTC price may witness a huge bull run over the next 18 months. After claiming a huge inflow of $150B to $200B in Bitcoin through the BlackRock ETF, the director of the firm is now confident of all the ETFs being approved in the next 3 to 6 months. This may transform the entire crypto space, with an elevated attention and adoption rate. 
With the growing confidence of investors and market participants, can the BTC price make it to $50,000 in 2024?
Analyzing the impact of the spot ETFs on the BTC price, a popular crypto proponent and influencer, tedtalksmacro, shared some context. Presently, the FDV, or fully diluted value, of Bitcoin, which is a product of maximum supply and current market price, is around $580 billion amidst the depths of the bear market and the regulatory tightening of the global central banks.
If the token forms a strong base around the current price, the next leg after the ETFs could elevate the FDV to around $780 billion, which is around $37,100 per BTC. Additionally, the central banks are estimated to ease their tight vigilance in the next 12 to 24 months, which may make the markets more optimistic, which may add up to a much higher speculative premium.
If all these go well and BTC market capitalisation moves back to $1 trillion, then the price may rise to $48,000 in late 2025 or early 2026. The analysis depends on speculations and assumptions, and many more are yet to come. However, positive sentiments continue to mount up expecting a similar price rise that happened with Gold since 2004 after the SPDR ETF.

LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100? ;"The post LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100?  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Taking a sharp correction from $114 to $57 between July and September, the LTC coin price brings a death cross. Taking a sideway step to avoid further correction, the Litecoin price made an inverted head and shoulders pattern with a neckline close to the $70 mark. 
Despite such sharp correction, the market sentiments expect positive outcomes and present optimistic Litecoin price predictions.
However, the overhead supply pressure moving along with the 50-day EMA nullifies the breakout possibility by forcing the LTC price back to the $60 support zone. Currently, the LTC price aims to form a morning star pattern to ignite the positive cycle from the crucial support zone. 
As of now, LTC price is trading at $65.41 with an intraday growth of 0.93%, highlighting a reversal possibility. This positive reversal will challenge the 50-day EMA and might cross the $70 support zone to give a bullish breakout. 
Moreover, the chances of a reversal in LTC price are increasing as the overall market enters the Uptober season.
However, the lack of trend momentum and significant overhead supply warns of a consolidation range or a further correction.
Technical indicators:
DMI indicator: The ADX line is still on a downward trend, indicating a low momentum phase for Litecoin. However, the bullish turnaround in the DI lines suggests a high probability of a breakout to the upside.
EMA: Rising above the 50-day EAMA will be critical for Litecoin price to continue the recovery rally. 
Considering the Litecoin momentum increases with the Bitcoin ETF decision this October, the altcoin may form a new swing high. If the LTC price exceeds the 50-day EMA, it will highlight a bullish entry spot for sideline traders. Moreover, the 50-day EMA breakout will challenge the $70 mark before reaching the psychological mark of $100.
Alternatively, if the downtrend persists, it might break $60 to test the bullish dominance at the $50 support level.

Analyst Nicholas Merten Issues Bitcoin Alert, Says BTC Headed for a ‘Really Difficult Time’ – Here’s Why;"Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten is warning of a risk that Bitcoin (BTC) faces in the current macroeconomic environment.
Merten tells his 512,000 YouTube subscribers that over the long term, Bitcoin is going to experience a “really difficult time” as liquidity tightens.
According to the widely followed crypto analyst, Bitcoin’s price direction is heavily determined by monetary policy.
“We cannot sit here and say that Bitcoin is this hedge against money supply debasement and that it should go up when there’s new money in the system like it has been for the past decade, and then simply ignore when it’s [money supply] contracting.
Bitcoin works in the opposite effect here. It hedges that money debasement to the upside – when you print more money, Bitcoin’s value should obviously increase to some degree. And during periods of times of monetary contraction, it should struggle. It should generally be moving lower here to the downside…
Liquidity is the lifeline, it is the blood of all financial assets to continue appreciating.”
According to Merten, while Bitcoin has demonstrated some resiliency over the past couple of months, that could change if sentiment turns bearish.
“If investors who are buying up here [the $25,000 – $32,000 range], who are providing that current support while some people are selling, if they don’t see that there are enough other bulls on the market who are willing to market buy alongside them and eat up the asks on the order book and continue pushing prices higher… 
If all those who have been market buying for the past couple of months realize that there’s really not enough momentum to clear through this prior support range that’s now acting as the resistance between $28,000 and $32,000, people are going to start cashing out.”
Bitcoin is trading at $27,715 at time of writing.

THORSwap Temporarily Suspended Due to Rise in Potentially Illicit Funds!;"The post THORSwap Temporarily Suspended Due to Rise in Potentially Illicit Funds! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Thorswap, a decentralized exchange based on ThorChain, is temporarily transitioning into maintenance mode due to a rise in potentially illicit funds moving through the platform. This move comes after the FTX hacker transferred 22,500 ETH ($38 million) this week, including swapping ether for bitcoin through ThorChain. Thorswap consulted with legal experts, advisors, and law enforcement agencies and will remain in maintenance mode until a more permanent and robust solution can be implemented.

Shielding Your Digital Realm: How to Protect Yourself and Crypto From SIM Swap Attacks;"In 2023, several SIM swap attacks have targeted cryptocurrency advocates and high-profile industry members, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Below is a comprehensive guide aimed at educating our readers on mitigating SIM swap attacks and safeguarding against hacks.
Recently, Bitcoin.com News reported that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin fell victim to a SIM swap attack. Moreover, this week, an Ethereum (ETH) investor suffered a SIM swap attack, losing 22 ETH on the friend.tech blockchain social media platform, which operates on the Base network. Unfortunately, a significant number of SIM swap attacks are targeting crypto investors. The subsequent walkthrough will guide our readers on how to avert a SIM swap attack.

So, what is a SIM swap attack? A SIM swap attack is a type of fraud in which a malicious actor deceives a mobile carrier into transferring the victim’s phone number to a new SIM card controlled by the attacker. Once the phone number is transferred, the attacker can receive the victim’s calls and text messages, including sensitive authentication codes sent via SMS for two-factor authentication (2FA).

This breach enables the attacker to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to the victim’s online accounts, such as email, crypto exchange accounts, and social media profiles, leading to potential financial loss and identity theft. While mitigation efforts are never 100% effective, there are several strategies individuals can employ to combat SIM swap breaches.
The first step is essentially online vigilance by being cautious of phishing emails and other tactics used by attackers to gain access to your personal information. Further enhanced vigilance includes avoiding responses to suspicious communications such as unknown texts, emails, and phone calls. The second measure is to leverage strong and unique passwords that protect each online account. Third, the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended, and veering away from an SMS text message or email-based 2FA is also advisable. It’s wise to use stronger multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods such as standalone authentication applications, biometrics, or physical security keys.
Another protective method, and one of the most important, is to engage in security measures by contacting your telephone carrier. With specific carriers, you can request additional security measures on your account. Users can also establish a unique PIN or passcode with their carrier, which adds an extra layer of security. Some telephone line carriers offer SIM protection features that add extra security to prevent SIM swap fraud. If you don’t contact your telephone carrier, you may miss out on some of the security measures that could prevent a SIM swap attack.
Another measure is to avoid using your telephone number for social media applications like X (formerly Twitter) and other online platforms and applications. Alongside your phone number, be cautious about sharing personal information online as every piece of evidence a hacker can gather is useful to crack online accounts. For services that require a phone number for verification or communication, consider using a secondary number or a virtual phone number service like Google Voice.
By following these steps, you can avoid a SIM swap attack and protect your finances and personal information. SIM-swapping attacks have been increasing in frequency in recent years, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning in March 2023 about the rise of SIM-swapping attacks, which have resulted in millions of dollars in losses.

BNB Price Prediction – Bears Aim Nasty Drop Below $200, Here’s Why;"BNB price (Binance coin) is still struggling to clear the $220 resistance against the US Dollar. The price could decline heavily below the $210 and $202 support levels.
This past week, BNB price attempted a recovery wave above the $210 level. The price was able to clear the $215 resistance zone. However, it failed to clear the $220 resistance.
There was a fresh decline in BNB, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price declined below the $215 support level. The bears pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high.
Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $214.5 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $215 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
It is consolidating near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high. If there is a recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $213 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).

The next resistance sits near the $215 level. A clear move above the $215 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test the main resistance at $220-$222. A close above the $222 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance.
If BNB fails to clear the $215 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $210 level. The next major support is near the $207 level.
If there is a downside break below the $207 support, the price could drop toward the $202 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $165 level.
Technical Indicators
4-Hours MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone.
4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $210, $207, and $202.

Bitdeer grows Bitcoin production by 195% YoY with a 35% September increase in BTC mined;"Singapore-based Bitdeer Technologies Group revealed a notable surge in mined Bitcoins in September 2023.
482 Bitcoins were mined, nearly tripling the numbers from the same time last year. Additionally, the Gedu mining data center alone produced 217 Bitcoins, accounting for approximately 45% of the total mined Bitcoins in September.
The increase is primarily attributed to the company’s operational efficiency, strategic business focus, and the stable operations of its newly constructed Gedu mining data center in Bhutan.
Bitdeer CEO Linghui Kong emphasized the company’s operational strength, which yielded robust results, with Bitcoin mining through their self-mining business experiencing an impressive 25.8% increment compared to the previous month.
According to Kong, the firm’s self-mining success is due to Bitdeer maintaining its aggregate electrical capacity at a steady 895MW. Highlighting the broader implications of these operational efficiencies, Kong stated,
“As we move into the remainder of the year, we are confident that our emphasis on strategic business development will bolster our results and help us generate long-term value for our shareholders.”
Beyond self-mining, Bitdeer’s operations span across three main business lines. These include Hash Rate Sharing, primarily involving Cloud Hash Rate, where Bitdeer offers hash rate subscription plans and shares mining income with customers. Hosting is a comprehensive mining machine hosting solution inclusive of deployment, maintenance, and management services for efficient cryptocurrency mining.
Bitdeer’s operations update indicated that the total hash rate under management as of Sep. 30 was 21.2 EH/s across the three primary business lines, with the proprietary hash rate at 8.7 EH/s. Bitdeer has 221,000 mining machines under management.
Bitdeer is not only expanding its Bitcoin mining capabilities but also its infrastructure. The company is steadily constructing a 175MW immersion cooling data center at its mining facility in Tydal, Norway. This expansion is part of Bitdeer’s concerted efforts to enhance its infrastructure and expand capacity. Completion of the Tydal Datacenter is expected in 2025.
As an industry player, Bitdeer’s operational updates offer an insightful glimpse into the dynamics of the cryptocurrency mining industry. The firm’s focus on optimizing operations, expanding infrastructure, and engaging in strategic business development is the backbone of its growth, offering valuable lessons for other organizations in the crypto space.
With mining data centers deployed in the United States, Norway, and Bhutan, Bitdeer continues providing its customers with comprehensive digital asset mining solutions.

Bitcoin Stopped at $28K, Toncoin Explodes 9% Daily (Market Watch);"Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down the $28,000 mark but was quickly stopped in its tracks and has returned to $27,500.
Most altcoins are trading sideways, with ADA and SOL gaining a few percentages, while ETH and BNB have retraced slightly.
Bitcoin initiated a massive leg up at the start of the week after a slow weekend that drove it from $27,000 to a multi-week peak at $28,600. As the community was anticipating the restart of the bull run, the cryptocurrency started losing value.
In a matter of a day, the asset lost just over a grand and went back below $27,500 until Thursday. That’s when another offensive arrived, and BTC soared to just over $28,000.
Nevertheless, it failed to continue upwards once again. The subsequent rejection pushed it back down by nearly a grand this time. As a result, bitcoin currently trades at around $27,500.
Its market capitalization has lost some ground, expectedly, and is down below $540 billion on CMC. its dominance over the altcoins, on the other hand, has increased slightly to 49.6%.
As reported yesterday, Toncoin, which was a massive gainer at the end of September, had lost its momentum with the start of the new month. However, the trending altcoin has gone back on the offensive in the past 24 hours. TON is up by approximately 9%, which has helped it reclaim the $2 mark.
Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and Avalanche are also slightly in the green. In fact, AVAX has jumped by about 4% and now stands firmly above $10.
In contrast, ETH, BNB, XRP, and TRX have registered minor losses. Overall, though, most larger-cap alts are relatively stable on a daily scale.
Consequently, the total crypto market cap has remained still at around $1.080 trillion on CMC.

Assessing Cardano’s Struggles: Will Key Support Levels Halt The Decline Above $0.27?;"Cardano (ADA) has been on a rollercoaster ride in the cryptocurrency market, with its recent price recovery rally encountering some significant challenges. 
As of the latest data from CoinGecko, ADA is trading at $0.261, showing a modest 1.7% gain in the past 24 hours, but boasting a seven-day rally of 4.9%. However, beneath the surface, there are signs of growing overhead pressure that could limit ADA’s upward momentum.
ADA’s journey to reclaim its previous highs faces its first major hurdle at the $0.26 mark. But this is just the beginning, as multiple layers of resistance lie above it, signifying significant supplier congestion levels. The price recovery may be stalling due to these formidable barriers.
To gain a deeper understanding of ADA’s current price dynamics, we turn to a new price analysis. Data reveals a crucial level of buying interest at $0.25. In fact, over 600,000 ADA buy limit orders are placed at this level. 
This suggests that if ADA can breach the range-high and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), it might find support around the mid-range of $0.25.
On the sell side, key sell limit orders start to emerge between $0.265 and $0.270, indicating that there is substantial selling pressure just above the current price levels.

The fate of ADA’s price also hinges on Bitcoin’s performance. Should Bitcoin post losses and dip below $27,500, ADA could follow suit, potentially finding support at the mid-range of $0.25. Conversely, a bullish rally in Bitcoin could set the stage for ADA to re-target its next hurdle at $0.28.
Technical indicators are also raising caution flags for ADA investors. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50 level and trending downward, indicating fading momentum. Furthermore, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in negative territory, signaling a lack of bullish sentiment.

Considering the current market conditions and technical indicators, analysts are leaning towards a bearish outlook for Cardano’s price. There is a possibility that ADA could descend to test the support floor at $0.2415. In a worst-case scenario, the price could plummet further, potentially reaching the range low of $0.2200, marking a substantial 15% drop from its current levels.
While Cardano has shown resilience with its recent gains, the road ahead is riddled with resistance levels, and Bitcoin’s influence remains a significant factor. Investors should closely monitor the developments in ADA’s price, as it navigates through these challenging market conditions. The cryptocurrency landscape is as unpredictable as ever, and ADA’s journey is far from certain.

"Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025!";"The post Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The bitcoin price trend is no less than ‘hot pancakes’ which is gaining global attention. The rise or fall in price is not restricted to demand and supply, as the institutions and whales, along with the market makers, do have a significant impact on it. After the collapse of Terra & FTX, the markets appeared to be uncertain and not in recovery mode for the next few months. However, the emergence of institutions in the crypto space lifted the momentum, which made the market participants optimistic about the future growth of the BTC price and the entire market.
It’s more clear that Bitcoin is fueling up for one of the most phenomenal runs in history. The major reason for being bullish on Bitcoin could be:
Considering these factors, industry experts believe the BTC price may witness a huge bull run over the next 18 months. After claiming a huge inflow of $150B to $200B in Bitcoin through the BlackRock ETF, the director of the firm is now confident of all the ETFs being approved in the next 3 to 6 months. This may transform the entire crypto space, with an elevated attention and adoption rate. 
With the growing confidence of investors and market participants, can the BTC price make it to $50,000 in 2024?
Analyzing the impact of the spot ETFs on the BTC price, a popular crypto proponent and influencer, tedtalksmacro, shared some context. Presently, the FDV, or fully diluted value, of Bitcoin, which is a product of maximum supply and current market price, is around $580 billion amidst the depths of the bear market and the regulatory tightening of the global central banks.
If the token forms a strong base around the current price, the next leg after the ETFs could elevate the FDV to around $780 billion, which is around $37,100 per BTC. Additionally, the central banks are estimated to ease their tight vigilance in the next 12 to 24 months, which may make the markets more optimistic, which may add up to a much higher speculative premium.
If all these go well and BTC market capitalisation moves back to $1 trillion, then the price may rise to $48,000 in late 2025 or early 2026. The analysis depends on speculations and assumptions, and many more are yet to come. However, positive sentiments continue to mount up expecting a similar price rise that happened with Gold since 2004 after the SPDR ETF.

LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100? ;"The post LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100?  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Taking a sharp correction from $114 to $57 between July and September, the LTC coin price brings a death cross. Taking a sideway step to avoid further correction, the Litecoin price made an inverted head and shoulders pattern with a neckline close to the $70 mark. 
Despite such sharp correction, the market sentiments expect positive outcomes and present optimistic Litecoin price predictions.
However, the overhead supply pressure moving along with the 50-day EMA nullifies the breakout possibility by forcing the LTC price back to the $60 support zone. Currently, the LTC price aims to form a morning star pattern to ignite the positive cycle from the crucial support zone. 
As of now, LTC price is trading at $65.41 with an intraday growth of 0.93%, highlighting a reversal possibility. This positive reversal will challenge the 50-day EMA and might cross the $70 support zone to give a bullish breakout. 
Moreover, the chances of a reversal in LTC price are increasing as the overall market enters the Uptober season.
However, the lack of trend momentum and significant overhead supply warns of a consolidation range or a further correction.
Technical indicators:
DMI indicator: The ADX line is still on a downward trend, indicating a low momentum phase for Litecoin. However, the bullish turnaround in the DI lines suggests a high probability of a breakout to the upside.
EMA: Rising above the 50-day EAMA will be critical for Litecoin price to continue the recovery rally. 
Considering the Litecoin momentum increases with the Bitcoin ETF decision this October, the altcoin may form a new swing high. If the LTC price exceeds the 50-day EMA, it will highlight a bullish entry spot for sideline traders. Moreover, the 50-day EMA breakout will challenge the $70 mark before reaching the psychological mark of $100.
Alternatively, if the downtrend persists, it might break $60 to test the bullish dominance at the $50 support level.

Analyst Nicholas Merten Issues Bitcoin Alert, Says BTC Headed for a ‘Really Difficult Time’ – Here’s Why;"Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten is warning of a risk that Bitcoin (BTC) faces in the current macroeconomic environment.
Merten tells his 512,000 YouTube subscribers that over the long term, Bitcoin is going to experience a “really difficult time” as liquidity tightens.
According to the widely followed crypto analyst, Bitcoin’s price direction is heavily determined by monetary policy.
“We cannot sit here and say that Bitcoin is this hedge against money supply debasement and that it should go up when there’s new money in the system like it has been for the past decade, and then simply ignore when it’s [money supply] contracting.
Bitcoin works in the opposite effect here. It hedges that money debasement to the upside – when you print more money, Bitcoin’s value should obviously increase to some degree. And during periods of times of monetary contraction, it should struggle. It should generally be moving lower here to the downside…
Liquidity is the lifeline, it is the blood of all financial assets to continue appreciating.”
According to Merten, while Bitcoin has demonstrated some resiliency over the past couple of months, that could change if sentiment turns bearish.
“If investors who are buying up here [the $25,000 – $32,000 range], who are providing that current support while some people are selling, if they don’t see that there are enough other bulls on the market who are willing to market buy alongside them and eat up the asks on the order book and continue pushing prices higher… 
If all those who have been market buying for the past couple of months realize that there’s really not enough momentum to clear through this prior support range that’s now acting as the resistance between $28,000 and $32,000, people are going to start cashing out.”
Bitcoin is trading at $27,715 at time of writing.

Shielding Your Digital Realm: How to Protect Yourself and Crypto From SIM Swap Attacks;"In 2023, several SIM swap attacks have targeted cryptocurrency advocates and high-profile industry members, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Below is a comprehensive guide aimed at educating our readers on mitigating SIM swap attacks and safeguarding against hacks.
Recently, Bitcoin.com News reported that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin fell victim to a SIM swap attack. Moreover, this week, an Ethereum (ETH) investor suffered a SIM swap attack, losing 22 ETH on the friend.tech blockchain social media platform, which operates on the Base network. Unfortunately, a significant number of SIM swap attacks are targeting crypto investors. The subsequent walkthrough will guide our readers on how to avert a SIM swap attack.

So, what is a SIM swap attack? A SIM swap attack is a type of fraud in which a malicious actor deceives a mobile carrier into transferring the victim’s phone number to a new SIM card controlled by the attacker. Once the phone number is transferred, the attacker can receive the victim’s calls and text messages, including sensitive authentication codes sent via SMS for two-factor authentication (2FA).

This breach enables the attacker to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to the victim’s online accounts, such as email, crypto exchange accounts, and social media profiles, leading to potential financial loss and identity theft. While mitigation efforts are never 100% effective, there are several strategies individuals can employ to combat SIM swap breaches.
The first step is essentially online vigilance by being cautious of phishing emails and other tactics used by attackers to gain access to your personal information. Further enhanced vigilance includes avoiding responses to suspicious communications such as unknown texts, emails, and phone calls. The second measure is to leverage strong and unique passwords that protect each online account. Third, the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended, and veering away from an SMS text message or email-based 2FA is also advisable. It’s wise to use stronger multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods such as standalone authentication applications, biometrics, or physical security keys.
Another protective method, and one of the most important, is to engage in security measures by contacting your telephone carrier. With specific carriers, you can request additional security measures on your account. Users can also establish a unique PIN or passcode with their carrier, which adds an extra layer of security. Some telephone line carriers offer SIM protection features that add extra security to prevent SIM swap fraud. If you don’t contact your telephone carrier, you may miss out on some of the security measures that could prevent a SIM swap attack.
Another measure is to avoid using your telephone number for social media applications like X (formerly Twitter) and other online platforms and applications. Alongside your phone number, be cautious about sharing personal information online as every piece of evidence a hacker can gather is useful to crack online accounts. For services that require a phone number for verification or communication, consider using a secondary number or a virtual phone number service like Google Voice.
By following these steps, you can avoid a SIM swap attack and protect your finances and personal information. SIM-swapping attacks have been increasing in frequency in recent years, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning in March 2023 about the rise of SIM-swapping attacks, which have resulted in millions of dollars in losses.

BNB Price Prediction – Bears Aim Nasty Drop Below $200, Here’s Why;"BNB price (Binance coin) is still struggling to clear the $220 resistance against the US Dollar. The price could decline heavily below the $210 and $202 support levels.
This past week, BNB price attempted a recovery wave above the $210 level. The price was able to clear the $215 resistance zone. However, it failed to clear the $220 resistance.
There was a fresh decline in BNB, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price declined below the $215 support level. The bears pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high.
Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $214.5 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $215 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
It is consolidating near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high. If there is a recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $213 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).

The next resistance sits near the $215 level. A clear move above the $215 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test the main resistance at $220-$222. A close above the $222 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance.
If BNB fails to clear the $215 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $210 level. The next major support is near the $207 level.
If there is a downside break below the $207 support, the price could drop toward the $202 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $165 level.

Bitdeer grows Bitcoin production by 195% YoY with a 35% September increase in BTC mined;"Singapore-based Bitdeer Technologies Group revealed a notable surge in mined Bitcoins in September 2023.
482 Bitcoins were mined, nearly tripling the numbers from the same time last year. Additionally, the Gedu mining data center alone produced 217 Bitcoins, accounting for approximately 45% of the total mined Bitcoins in September.
The increase is primarily attributed to the company’s operational efficiency, strategic business focus, and the stable operations of its newly constructed Gedu mining data center in Bhutan.
Bitdeer CEO Linghui Kong emphasized the company’s operational strength, which yielded robust results, with Bitcoin mining through their self-mining business experiencing an impressive 25.8% increment compared to the previous month.
According to Kong, the firm’s self-mining success is due to Bitdeer maintaining its aggregate electrical capacity at a steady 895MW. Highlighting the broader implications of these operational efficiencies, Kong stated,
“As we move into the remainder of the year, we are confident that our emphasis on strategic business development will bolster our results and help us generate long-term value for our shareholders.”
Beyond self-mining, Bitdeer’s operations span across three main business lines. These include Hash Rate Sharing, primarily involving Cloud Hash Rate, where Bitdeer offers hash rate subscription plans and shares mining income with customers. Hosting is a comprehensive mining machine hosting solution inclusive of deployment, maintenance, and management services for efficient cryptocurrency mining.
Bitdeer’s operations update indicated that the total hash rate under management as of Sep. 30 was 21.2 EH/s across the three primary business lines, with the proprietary hash rate at 8.7 EH/s. Bitdeer has 221,000 mining machines under management.
Bitdeer is not only expanding its Bitcoin mining capabilities but also its infrastructure. The company is steadily constructing a 175MW immersion cooling data center at its mining facility in Tydal, Norway. This expansion is part of Bitdeer’s concerted efforts to enhance its infrastructure and expand capacity. Completion of the Tydal Datacenter is expected in 2025.
As an industry player, Bitdeer’s operational updates offer an insightful glimpse into the dynamics of the cryptocurrency mining industry. The firm’s focus on optimizing operations, expanding infrastructure, and engaging in strategic business development is the backbone of its growth, offering valuable lessons for other organizations in the crypto space.
With mining data centers deployed in the United States, Norway, and Bhutan, Bitdeer continues providing its customers with comprehensive digital asset mining solutions.

Bitcoin Stopped at $28K, Toncoin Explodes 9% Daily (Market Watch);"Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down the $28,000 mark but was quickly stopped in its tracks and has returned to $27,500.
Most altcoins are trading sideways, with ADA and SOL gaining a few percentages, while ETH and BNB have retraced slightly.
Bitcoin initiated a massive leg up at the start of the week after a slow weekend that drove it from $27,000 to a multi-week peak at $28,600. As the community was anticipating the restart of the bull run, the cryptocurrency started losing value.
In a matter of a day, the asset lost just over a grand and went back below $27,500 until Thursday. That’s when another offensive arrived, and BTC soared to just over $28,000.
Nevertheless, it failed to continue upwards once again. The subsequent rejection pushed it back down by nearly a grand this time. As a result, bitcoin currently trades at around $27,500.
Its market capitalization has lost some ground, expectedly, and is down below $540 billion on CMC. its dominance over the altcoins, on the other hand, has increased slightly to 49.6%.
As reported yesterday, Toncoin, which was a massive gainer at the end of September, had lost its momentum with the start of the new month. However, the trending altcoin has gone back on the offensive in the past 24 hours. TON is up by approximately 9%, which has helped it reclaim the $2 mark.
Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and Avalanche are also slightly in the green. In fact, AVAX has jumped by about 4% and now stands firmly above $10.
In contrast, ETH, BNB, XRP, and TRX have registered minor losses. Overall, though, most larger-cap alts are relatively stable on a daily scale.
Consequently, the total crypto market cap has remained still at around $1.080 trillion on CMC.

Assessing Cardano’s Struggles: Will Key Support Levels Halt The Decline Above $0.27?;"Cardano (ADA) has been on a rollercoaster ride in the cryptocurrency market, with its recent price recovery rally encountering some significant challenges. 
As of the latest data from CoinGecko, ADA is trading at $0.261, showing a modest 1.7% gain in the past 24 hours, but boasting a seven-day rally of 4.9%. However, beneath the surface, there are signs of growing overhead pressure that could limit ADA’s upward momentum.
ADA’s journey to reclaim its previous highs faces its first major hurdle at the $0.26 mark. But this is just the beginning, as multiple layers of resistance lie above it, signifying significant supplier congestion levels. The price recovery may be stalling due to these formidable barriers.
To gain a deeper understanding of ADA’s current price dynamics, we turn to a new price analysis. Data reveals a crucial level of buying interest at $0.25. In fact, over 600,000 ADA buy limit orders are placed at this level. 
This suggests that if ADA can breach the range-high and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), it might find support around the mid-range of $0.25.
On the sell side, key sell limit orders start to emerge between $0.265 and $0.270, indicating that there is substantial selling pressure just above the current price levels.

The fate of ADA’s price also hinges on Bitcoin’s performance. Should Bitcoin post losses and dip below $27,500, ADA could follow suit, potentially finding support at the mid-range of $0.25. Conversely, a bullish rally in Bitcoin could set the stage for ADA to re-target its next hurdle at $0.28.
Technical indicators are also raising caution flags for ADA investors. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50 level and trending downward, indicating fading momentum. Furthermore, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in negative territory, signaling a lack of bullish sentiment.

Considering the current market conditions and technical indicators, analysts are leaning towards a bearish outlook for Cardano’s price. There is a possibility that ADA could descend to test the support floor at $0.2415. In a worst-case scenario, the price could plummet further, potentially reaching the range low of $0.2200, marking a substantial 15% drop from its current levels.
While Cardano has shown resilience with its recent gains, the road ahead is riddled with resistance levels, and Bitcoin’s influence remains a significant factor. Investors should closely monitor the developments in ADA’s price, as it navigates through these challenging market conditions. The cryptocurrency landscape is as unpredictable as ever, and ADA’s journey is far from certain.

"Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025!";"The post Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The bitcoin price trend is no less than ‘hot pancakes’ which is gaining global attention. The rise or fall in price is not restricted to demand and supply, as the institutions and whales, along with the market makers, do have a significant impact on it. After the collapse of Terra & FTX, the markets appeared to be uncertain and not in recovery mode for the next few months. However, the emergence of institutions in the crypto space lifted the momentum, which made the market participants optimistic about the future growth of the BTC price and the entire market.
It’s more clear that Bitcoin is fueling up for one of the most phenomenal runs in history. The major reason for being bullish on Bitcoin could be:
Considering these factors, industry experts believe the BTC price may witness a huge bull run over the next 18 months. After claiming a huge inflow of $150B to $200B in Bitcoin through the BlackRock ETF, the director of the firm is now confident of all the ETFs being approved in the next 3 to 6 months. This may transform the entire crypto space, with an elevated attention and adoption rate. 
With the growing confidence of investors and market participants, can the BTC price make it to $50,000 in 2024?
Analyzing the impact of the spot ETFs on the BTC price, a popular crypto proponent and influencer, tedtalksmacro, shared some context. Presently, the FDV, or fully diluted value, of Bitcoin, which is a product of maximum supply and current market price, is around $580 billion amidst the depths of the bear market and the regulatory tightening of the global central banks.
If the token forms a strong base around the current price, the next leg after the ETFs could elevate the FDV to around $780 billion, which is around $37,100 per BTC. Additionally, the central banks are estimated to ease their tight vigilance in the next 12 to 24 months, which may make the markets more optimistic, which may add up to a much higher speculative premium.
If all these go well and BTC market capitalisation moves back to $1 trillion, then the price may rise to $48,000 in late 2025 or early 2026. The analysis depends on speculations and assumptions, and many more are yet to come. However, positive sentiments continue to mount up expecting a similar price rise that happened with Gold since 2004 after the SPDR ETF.

LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100? ;"The post LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100?  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Taking a sharp correction from $114 to $57 between July and September, the LTC coin price brings a death cross. Taking a sideway step to avoid further correction, the Litecoin price made an inverted head and shoulders pattern with a neckline close to the $70 mark. 
Despite such sharp correction, the market sentiments expect positive outcomes and present optimistic Litecoin price predictions.
However, the overhead supply pressure moving along with the 50-day EMA nullifies the breakout possibility by forcing the LTC price back to the $60 support zone. Currently, the LTC price aims to form a morning star pattern to ignite the positive cycle from the crucial support zone. 
As of now, LTC price is trading at $65.41 with an intraday growth of 0.93%, highlighting a reversal possibility. This positive reversal will challenge the 50-day EMA and might cross the $70 support zone to give a bullish breakout. 
Moreover, the chances of a reversal in LTC price are increasing as the overall market enters the Uptober season.
However, the lack of trend momentum and significant overhead supply warns of a consolidation range or a further correction.
Technical indicators:
DMI indicator: The ADX line is still on a downward trend, indicating a low momentum phase for Litecoin. However, the bullish turnaround in the DI lines suggests a high probability of a breakout to the upside.
EMA: Rising above the 50-day EAMA will be critical for Litecoin price to continue the recovery rally. 
Considering the Litecoin momentum increases with the Bitcoin ETF decision this October, the altcoin may form a new swing high. If the LTC price exceeds the 50-day EMA, it will highlight a bullish entry spot for sideline traders. Moreover, the 50-day EMA breakout will challenge the $70 mark before reaching the psychological mark of $100.
Alternatively, if the downtrend persists, it might break $60 to test the bullish dominance at the $50 support level.

Analyst Nicholas Merten Issues Bitcoin Alert, Says BTC Headed for a ‘Really Difficult Time’ – Here’s Why;"Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten is warning of a risk that Bitcoin (BTC) faces in the current macroeconomic environment.
Merten tells his 512,000 YouTube subscribers that over the long term, Bitcoin is going to experience a “really difficult time” as liquidity tightens.
According to the widely followed crypto analyst, Bitcoin’s price direction is heavily determined by monetary policy.
“We cannot sit here and say that Bitcoin is this hedge against money supply debasement and that it should go up when there’s new money in the system like it has been for the past decade, and then simply ignore when it’s [money supply] contracting.
Bitcoin works in the opposite effect here. It hedges that money debasement to the upside – when you print more money, Bitcoin’s value should obviously increase to some degree. And during periods of times of monetary contraction, it should struggle. It should generally be moving lower here to the downside…
Liquidity is the lifeline, it is the blood of all financial assets to continue appreciating.”
According to Merten, while Bitcoin has demonstrated some resiliency over the past couple of months, that could change if sentiment turns bearish.
“If investors who are buying up here [the $25,000 – $32,000 range], who are providing that current support while some people are selling, if they don’t see that there are enough other bulls on the market who are willing to market buy alongside them and eat up the asks on the order book and continue pushing prices higher… 
If all those who have been market buying for the past couple of months realize that there’s really not enough momentum to clear through this prior support range that’s now acting as the resistance between $28,000 and $32,000, people are going to start cashing out.”
Bitcoin is trading at $27,715 at time of writing.

Shielding Your Digital Realm: How to Protect Yourself and Crypto From SIM Swap Attacks;"In 2023, several SIM swap attacks have targeted cryptocurrency advocates and high-profile industry members, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Below is a comprehensive guide aimed at educating our readers on mitigating SIM swap attacks and safeguarding against hacks.
Recently, Bitcoin.com News reported that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin fell victim to a SIM swap attack. Moreover, this week, an Ethereum (ETH) investor suffered a SIM swap attack, losing 22 ETH on the friend.tech blockchain social media platform, which operates on the Base network. Unfortunately, a significant number of SIM swap attacks are targeting crypto investors. The subsequent walkthrough will guide our readers on how to avert a SIM swap attack.

So, what is a SIM swap attack? A SIM swap attack is a type of fraud in which a malicious actor deceives a mobile carrier into transferring the victim’s phone number to a new SIM card controlled by the attacker. Once the phone number is transferred, the attacker can receive the victim’s calls and text messages, including sensitive authentication codes sent via SMS for two-factor authentication (2FA).

This breach enables the attacker to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to the victim’s online accounts, such as email, crypto exchange accounts, and social media profiles, leading to potential financial loss and identity theft. While mitigation efforts are never 100% effective, there are several strategies individuals can employ to combat SIM swap breaches.
The first step is essentially online vigilance by being cautious of phishing emails and other tactics used by attackers to gain access to your personal information. Further enhanced vigilance includes avoiding responses to suspicious communications such as unknown texts, emails, and phone calls. The second measure is to leverage strong and unique passwords that protect each online account. Third, the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended, and veering away from an SMS text message or email-based 2FA is also advisable. It’s wise to use stronger multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods such as standalone authentication applications, biometrics, or physical security keys.
Another protective method, and one of the most important, is to engage in security measures by contacting your telephone carrier. With specific carriers, you can request additional security measures on your account. Users can also establish a unique PIN or passcode with their carrier, which adds an extra layer of security. Some telephone line carriers offer SIM protection features that add extra security to prevent SIM swap fraud. If you don’t contact your telephone carrier, you may miss out on some of the security measures that could prevent a SIM swap attack.
Another measure is to avoid using your telephone number for social media applications like X (formerly Twitter) and other online platforms and applications. Alongside your phone number, be cautious about sharing personal information online as every piece of evidence a hacker can gather is useful to crack online accounts. For services that require a phone number for verification or communication, consider using a secondary number or a virtual phone number service like Google Voice.
By following these steps, you can avoid a SIM swap attack and protect your finances and personal information. SIM-swapping attacks have been increasing in frequency in recent years, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning in March 2023 about the rise of SIM-swapping attacks, which have resulted in millions of dollars in losses.

BNB Price Prediction – Bears Aim Nasty Drop Below $200, Here’s Why;"BNB price (Binance coin) is still struggling to clear the $220 resistance against the US Dollar. The price could decline heavily below the $210 and $202 support levels.
This past week, BNB price attempted a recovery wave above the $210 level. The price was able to clear the $215 resistance zone. However, it failed to clear the $220 resistance.
There was a fresh decline in BNB, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price declined below the $215 support level. The bears pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high.
Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $214.5 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $215 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
It is consolidating near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high. If there is a recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $213 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).

Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com
The next resistance sits near the $215 level. A clear move above the $215 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test the main resistance at $220-$222. A close above the $222 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance.
If BNB fails to clear the $215 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $210 level. The next major support is near the $207 level.

BNB price (Binance coin) is still struggling to clear the $220 resistance against the US Dollar. The price could decline heavily below the $210 and $202 support levels.
This past week, BNB price attempted a recovery wave above the $210 level. The price was able to clear the $215 resistance zone. However, it failed to clear the $220 resistance.
There was a fresh decline in BNB, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price declined below the $215 support level. The bears pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high.
Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $214.5 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $215 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
It is consolidating near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high. If there is a recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $213 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).

The next resistance sits near the $215 level. A clear move above the $215 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test the main resistance at $220-$222. A close above the $222 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance.
If BNB fails to clear the $215 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $210 level. The next major support is near the $207 level.
If there is a downside break below the $207 support, the price could drop toward the $202 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $165 level.

4-Hours MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone.

Bitdeer grows Bitcoin production by 195% YoY with a 35% September increase in BTC mined;"Singapore-based Bitdeer Technologies Group revealed a notable surge in mined Bitcoins in September 2023.
482 Bitcoins were mined, nearly tripling the numbers from the same time last year. Additionally, the Gedu mining data center alone produced 217 Bitcoins, accounting for approximately 45% of the total mined Bitcoins in September.
The increase is primarily attributed to the company’s operational efficiency, strategic business focus, and the stable operations of its newly constructed Gedu mining data center in Bhutan.
Bitdeer CEO Linghui Kong emphasized the company’s operational strength, which yielded robust results, with Bitcoin mining through their self-mining business experiencing an impressive 25.8% increment compared to the previous month.
According to Kong, the firm’s self-mining success is due to Bitdeer maintaining its aggregate electrical capacity at a steady 895MW. Highlighting the broader implications of these operational efficiencies, Kong stated,
“As we move into the remainder of the year, we are confident that our emphasis on strategic business development will bolster our results and help us generate long-term value for our shareholders.”
Beyond self-mining, Bitdeer’s operations span across three main business lines. These include Hash Rate Sharing, primarily involving Cloud Hash Rate, where Bitdeer offers hash rate subscription plans and shares mining income with customers. Hosting is a comprehensive mining machine hosting solution inclusive of deployment, maintenance, and management services for efficient cryptocurrency mining.
Bitdeer’s operations update indicated that the total hash rate under management as of Sep. 30 was 21.2 EH/s across the three primary business lines, with the proprietary hash rate at 8.7 EH/s. Bitdeer has 221,000 mining machines under management.
Bitdeer is not only expanding its Bitcoin mining capabilities but also its infrastructure. The company is steadily constructing a 175MW immersion cooling data center at its mining facility in Tydal, Norway. This expansion is part of Bitdeer’s concerted efforts to enhance its infrastructure and expand capacity. Completion of the Tydal Datacenter is expected in 2025.
As an industry player, Bitdeer’s operational updates offer an insightful glimpse into the dynamics of the cryptocurrency mining industry. The firm’s focus on optimizing operations, expanding infrastructure, and engaging in strategic business development is the backbone of its growth, offering valuable lessons for other organizations in the crypto space.
With mining data centers deployed in the United States, Norway, and Bhutan, Bitdeer continues providing its customers with comprehensive digital asset mining solutions.

Bitcoin Stopped at $28K, Toncoin Explodes 9% Daily (Market Watch);"Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down the $28,000 mark but was quickly stopped in its tracks and has returned to $27,500.
Most altcoins are trading sideways, with ADA and SOL gaining a few percentages, while ETH and BNB have retraced slightly.
Bitcoin initiated a massive leg up at the start of the week after a slow weekend that drove it from $27,000 to a multi-week peak at $28,600. As the community was anticipating the restart of the bull run, the cryptocurrency started losing value.
In a matter of a day, the asset lost just over a grand and went back below $27,500 until Thursday. That’s when another offensive arrived, and BTC soared to just over $28,000.
Nevertheless, it failed to continue upwards once again. The subsequent rejection pushed it back down by nearly a grand this time. As a result, bitcoin currently trades at around $27,500.
Its market capitalization has lost some ground, expectedly, and is down below $540 billion on CMC. its dominance over the altcoins, on the other hand, has increased slightly to 49.6%.
As reported yesterday, Toncoin, which was a massive gainer at the end of September, had lost its momentum with the start of the new month. However, the trending altcoin has gone back on the offensive in the past 24 hours. TON is up by approximately 9%, which has helped it reclaim the $2 mark.
Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and Avalanche are also slightly in the green. In fact, AVAX has jumped by about 4% and now stands firmly above $10.
In contrast, ETH, BNB, XRP, and TRX have registered minor losses. Overall, though, most larger-cap alts are relatively stable on a daily scale.
Consequently, the total crypto market cap has remained still at around $1.080 trillion on CMC.

Assessing Cardano’s Struggles: Will Key Support Levels Halt The Decline Above $0.27?;"Cardano (ADA) has been on a rollercoaster ride in the cryptocurrency market, with its recent price recovery rally encountering some significant challenges. 
As of the latest data from CoinGecko, ADA is trading at $0.261, showing a modest 1.7% gain in the past 24 hours, but boasting a seven-day rally of 4.9%. However, beneath the surface, there are signs of growing overhead pressure that could limit ADA’s upward momentum.
ADA’s journey to reclaim its previous highs faces its first major hurdle at the $0.26 mark. But this is just the beginning, as multiple layers of resistance lie above it, signifying significant supplier congestion levels. The price recovery may be stalling due to these formidable barriers.
To gain a deeper understanding of ADA’s current price dynamics, we turn to a new price analysis. Data reveals a crucial level of buying interest at $0.25. In fact, over 600,000 ADA buy limit orders are placed at this level. 
This suggests that if ADA can breach the range-high and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), it might find support around the mid-range of $0.25.
On the sell side, key sell limit orders start to emerge between $0.265 and $0.270, indicating that there is substantial selling pressure just above the current price levels.

The fate of ADA’s price also hinges on Bitcoin’s performance. Should Bitcoin post losses and dip below $27,500, ADA could follow suit, potentially finding support at the mid-range of $0.25. Conversely, a bullish rally in Bitcoin could set the stage for ADA to re-target its next hurdle at $0.28.
Technical indicators are also raising caution flags for ADA investors. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50 level and trending downward, indicating fading momentum. Furthermore, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in negative territory, signaling a lack of bullish sentiment.

Considering the current market conditions and technical indicators, analysts are leaning towards a bearish outlook for Cardano’s price. There is a possibility that ADA could descend to test the support floor at $0.2415. In a worst-case scenario, the price could plummet further, potentially reaching the range low of $0.2200, marking a substantial 15% drop from its current levels.
While Cardano has shown resilience with its recent gains, the road ahead is riddled with resistance levels, and Bitcoin’s influence remains a significant factor. Investors should closely monitor the developments in ADA’s price, as it navigates through these challenging market conditions. The cryptocurrency landscape is as unpredictable as ever, and ADA’s journey is far from certain.

"Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025!";"The post Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The bitcoin price trend is no less than ‘hot pancakes’ which is gaining global attention. The rise or fall in price is not restricted to demand and supply, as the institutions and whales, along with the market makers, do have a significant impact on it. After the collapse of Terra & FTX, the markets appeared to be uncertain and not in recovery mode for the next few months. However, the emergence of institutions in the crypto space lifted the momentum, which made the market participants optimistic about the future growth of the BTC price and the entire market.
It’s more clear that Bitcoin is fueling up for one of the most phenomenal runs in history. The major reason for being bullish on Bitcoin could be:
Considering these factors, industry experts believe the BTC price may witness a huge bull run over the next 18 months. After claiming a huge inflow of $150B to $200B in Bitcoin through the BlackRock ETF, the director of the firm is now confident of all the ETFs being approved in the next 3 to 6 months. This may transform the entire crypto space, with an elevated attention and adoption rate. 
With the growing confidence of investors and market participants, can the BTC price make it to $50,000 in 2024?
Analyzing the impact of the spot ETFs on the BTC price, a popular crypto proponent and influencer, tedtalksmacro, shared some context. Presently, the FDV, or fully diluted value, of Bitcoin, which is a product of maximum supply and current market price, is around $580 billion amidst the depths of the bear market and the regulatory tightening of the global central banks.
If the token forms a strong base around the current price, the next leg after the ETFs could elevate the FDV to around $780 billion, which is around $37,100 per BTC. Additionally, the central banks are estimated to ease their tight vigilance in the next 12 to 24 months, which may make the markets more optimistic, which may add up to a much higher speculative premium.
If all these go well and BTC market capitalisation moves back to $1 trillion, then the price may rise to $48,000 in late 2025 or early 2026. The analysis depends on speculations and assumptions, and many more are yet to come. However, positive sentiments continue to mount up expecting a similar price rise that happened with Gold since 2004 after the SPDR ETF.

LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100? ;"The post LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100?  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Taking a sharp correction from $114 to $57 between July and September, the LTC coin price brings a death cross. Taking a sideway step to avoid further correction, the Litecoin price made an inverted head and shoulders pattern with a neckline close to the $70 mark. 
Despite such sharp correction, the market sentiments expect positive outcomes and present optimistic Litecoin price predictions.
However, the overhead supply pressure moving along with the 50-day EMA nullifies the breakout possibility by forcing the LTC price back to the $60 support zone. Currently, the LTC price aims to form a morning star pattern to ignite the positive cycle from the crucial support zone. 
As of now, LTC price is trading at $65.41 with an intraday growth of 0.93%, highlighting a reversal possibility. This positive reversal will challenge the 50-day EMA and might cross the $70 support zone to give a bullish breakout. 
Moreover, the chances of a reversal in LTC price are increasing as the overall market enters the Uptober season.
However, the lack of trend momentum and significant overhead supply warns of a consolidation range or a further correction.
Technical indicators:
DMI indicator: The ADX line is still on a downward trend, indicating a low momentum phase for Litecoin. However, the bullish turnaround in the DI lines suggests a high probability of a breakout to the upside.
EMA: Rising above the 50-day EAMA will be critical for Litecoin price to continue the recovery rally. 
Considering the Litecoin momentum increases with the Bitcoin ETF decision this October, the altcoin may form a new swing high. If the LTC price exceeds the 50-day EMA, it will highlight a bullish entry spot for sideline traders. Moreover, the 50-day EMA breakout will challenge the $70 mark before reaching the psychological mark of $100.
Alternatively, if the downtrend persists, it might break $60 to test the bullish dominance at the $50 support level.

Analyst Nicholas Merten Issues Bitcoin Alert, Says BTC Headed for a ‘Really Difficult Time’ – Here’s Why;"Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten is warning of a risk that Bitcoin (BTC) faces in the current macroeconomic environment.
Merten tells his 512,000 YouTube subscribers that over the long term, Bitcoin is going to experience a “really difficult time” as liquidity tightens.
According to the widely followed crypto analyst, Bitcoin’s price direction is heavily determined by monetary policy.
“We cannot sit here and say that Bitcoin is this hedge against money supply debasement and that it should go up when there’s new money in the system like it has been for the past decade, and then simply ignore when it’s [money supply] contracting.
Bitcoin works in the opposite effect here. It hedges that money debasement to the upside – when you print more money, Bitcoin’s value should obviously increase to some degree. And during periods of times of monetary contraction, it should struggle. It should generally be moving lower here to the downside…
Liquidity is the lifeline, it is the blood of all financial assets to continue appreciating.”
According to Merten, while Bitcoin has demonstrated some resiliency over the past couple of months, that could change if sentiment turns bearish.
“If investors who are buying up here [the $25,000 – $32,000 range], who are providing that current support while some people are selling, if they don’t see that there are enough other bulls on the market who are willing to market buy alongside them and eat up the asks on the order book and continue pushing prices higher… 
If all those who have been market buying for the past couple of months realize that there’s really not enough momentum to clear through this prior support range that’s now acting as the resistance between $28,000 and $32,000, people are going to start cashing out.”

Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten is warning of a risk that Bitcoin (BTC) faces in the current macroeconomic environment.
Merten tells his 512,000 YouTube subscribers that over the long term, Bitcoin is going to experience a “really difficult time” as liquidity tightens.
According to the widely followed crypto analyst, Bitcoin’s price direction is heavily determined by monetary policy.
“We cannot sit here and say that Bitcoin is this hedge against money supply debasement and that it should go up when there’s new money in the system like it has been for the past decade, and then simply ignore when it’s [money supply] contracting.
Bitcoin works in the opposite effect here. It hedges that money debasement to the upside – when you print more money, Bitcoin’s value should obviously increase to some degree. And during periods of times of monetary contraction, it should struggle. It should generally be moving lower here to the downside…
Liquidity is the lifeline, it is the blood of all financial assets to continue appreciating.”
According to Merten, while Bitcoin has demonstrated some resiliency over the past couple of months, that could change if sentiment turns bearish.
“If investors who are buying up here [the $25,000 – $32,000 range], who are providing that current support while some people are selling, if they don’t see that there are enough other bulls on the market who are willing to market buy alongside them and eat up the asks on the order book and continue pushing prices higher… 
If all those who have been market buying for the past couple of months realize that there’s really not enough momentum to clear through this prior support range that’s now acting as the resistance between $28,000 and $32,000, people are going to start cashing out.”

Shielding Your Digital Realm: How to Protect Yourself and Crypto From SIM Swap Attacks;"In 2023, several SIM swap attacks have targeted cryptocurrency advocates and high-profile industry members, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Below is a comprehensive guide aimed at educating our readers on mitigating SIM swap attacks and safeguarding against hacks.
Recently, Bitcoin.com News reported that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin fell victim to a SIM swap attack. Moreover, this week, an Ethereum (ETH) investor suffered a SIM swap attack, losing 22 ETH on the friend.tech blockchain social media platform, which operates on the Base network. Unfortunately, a significant number of SIM swap attacks are targeting crypto investors. The subsequent walkthrough will guide our readers on how to avert a SIM swap attack.

So, what is a SIM swap attack? A SIM swap attack is a type of fraud in which a malicious actor deceives a mobile carrier into transferring the victim’s phone number to a new SIM card controlled by the attacker. Once the phone number is transferred, the attacker can receive the victim’s calls and text messages, including sensitive authentication codes sent via SMS for two-factor authentication (2FA).

This breach enables the attacker to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to the victim’s online accounts, such as email, crypto exchange accounts, and social media profiles, leading to potential financial loss and identity theft. While mitigation efforts are never 100% effective, there are several strategies individuals can employ to combat SIM swap breaches.
The first step is essentially online vigilance by being cautious of phishing emails and other tactics used by attackers to gain access to your personal information. Further enhanced vigilance includes avoiding responses to suspicious communications such as unknown texts, emails, and phone calls. The second measure is to leverage strong and unique passwords that protect each online account. Third, the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended, and veering away from an SMS text message or email-based 2FA is also advisable. It’s wise to use stronger multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods such as standalone authentication applications, biometrics, or physical security keys.
Another protective method, and one of the most important, is to engage in security measures by contacting your telephone carrier. With specific carriers, you can request additional security measures on your account. Users can also establish a unique PIN or passcode with their carrier, which adds an extra layer of security. Some telephone line carriers offer SIM protection features that add extra security to prevent SIM swap fraud. If you don’t contact your telephone carrier, you may miss out on some of the security measures that could prevent a SIM swap attack.
Another measure is to avoid using your telephone number for social media applications like X (formerly Twitter) and other online platforms and applications. Alongside your phone number, be cautious about sharing personal information online as every piece of evidence a hacker can gather is useful to crack online accounts. For services that require a phone number for verification or communication, consider using a secondary number or a virtual phone number service like Google Voice.
By following these steps, you can avoid a SIM swap attack and protect your finances and personal information. SIM-swapping attacks have been increasing in frequency in recent years, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning in March 2023 about the rise of SIM-swapping attacks, which have resulted in millions of dollars in losses.

BNB Price Prediction – Bears Aim Nasty Drop Below $200, Here’s Why;"BNB price (Binance coin) is still struggling to clear the $220 resistance against the US Dollar. The price could decline heavily below the $210 and $202 support levels.
This past week, BNB price attempted a recovery wave above the $210 level. The price was able to clear the $215 resistance zone. However, it failed to clear the $220 resistance.
There was a fresh decline in BNB, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price declined below the $215 support level. The bears pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high.
Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $214.5 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $215 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
It is consolidating near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high. If there is a recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $213 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).

The next resistance sits near the $215 level. A clear move above the $215 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test the main resistance at $220-$222. A close above the $222 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance.
If BNB fails to clear the $215 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $210 level. The next major support is near the $207 level.
If there is a downside break below the $207 support, the price could drop toward the $202 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $165 level.
Technical Indicators
4-Hours MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone.
4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $210, $207, and $202.

Bitdeer grows Bitcoin production by 195% YoY with a 35% September increase in BTC mined;"Singapore-based Bitdeer Technologies Group revealed a notable surge in mined Bitcoins in September 2023.
482 Bitcoins were mined, nearly tripling the numbers from the same time last year. Additionally, the Gedu mining data center alone produced 217 Bitcoins, accounting for approximately 45% of the total mined Bitcoins in September.
The increase is primarily attributed to the company’s operational efficiency, strategic business focus, and the stable operations of its newly constructed Gedu mining data center in Bhutan.
Bitdeer CEO Linghui Kong emphasized the company’s operational strength, which yielded robust results, with Bitcoin mining through their self-mining business experiencing an impressive 25.8% increment compared to the previous month.
According to Kong, the firm’s self-mining success is due to Bitdeer maintaining its aggregate electrical capacity at a steady 895MW. Highlighting the broader implications of these operational efficiencies, Kong stated,
“As we move into the remainder of the year, we are confident that our emphasis on strategic business development will bolster our results and help us generate long-term value for our shareholders.”
Beyond self-mining, Bitdeer’s operations span across three main business lines. These include Hash Rate Sharing, primarily involving Cloud Hash Rate, where Bitdeer offers hash rate subscription plans and shares mining income with customers. Hosting is a comprehensive mining machine hosting solution inclusive of deployment, maintenance, and management services for efficient cryptocurrency mining.
Bitdeer’s operations update indicated that the total hash rate under management as of Sep. 30 was 21.2 EH/s across the three primary business lines, with the proprietary hash rate at 8.7 EH/s. Bitdeer has 221,000 mining machines under management.
Bitdeer is not only expanding its Bitcoin mining capabilities but also its infrastructure. The company is steadily constructing a 175MW immersion cooling data center at its mining facility in Tydal, Norway. This expansion is part of Bitdeer’s concerted efforts to enhance its infrastructure and expand capacity. Completion of the Tydal Datacenter is expected in 2025.
As an industry player, Bitdeer’s operational updates offer an insightful glimpse into the dynamics of the cryptocurrency mining industry. The firm’s focus on optimizing operations, expanding infrastructure, and engaging in strategic business development is the backbone of its growth, offering valuable lessons for other organizations in the crypto space.
With mining data centers deployed in the United States, Norway, and Bhutan, Bitdeer continues providing its customers with comprehensive digital asset mining solutions.

Bitcoin Stopped at $28K, Toncoin Explodes 9% Daily (Market Watch);"Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down the $28,000 mark but was quickly stopped in its tracks and has returned to $27,500.
Most altcoins are trading sideways, with ADA and SOL gaining a few percentages, while ETH and BNB have retraced slightly.
Bitcoin initiated a massive leg up at the start of the week after a slow weekend that drove it from $27,000 to a multi-week peak at $28,600. As the community was anticipating the restart of the bull run, the cryptocurrency started losing value.
In a matter of a day, the asset lost just over a grand and went back below $27,500 until Thursday. That’s when another offensive arrived, and BTC soared to just over $28,000.
Nevertheless, it failed to continue upwards once again. The subsequent rejection pushed it back down by nearly a grand this time. As a result, bitcoin currently trades at around $27,500.
Its market capitalization has lost some ground, expectedly, and is down below $540 billion on CMC. its dominance over the altcoins, on the other hand, has increased slightly to 49.6%.
As reported yesterday, Toncoin, which was a massive gainer at the end of September, had lost its momentum with the start of the new month. However, the trending altcoin has gone back on the offensive in the past 24 hours. TON is up by approximately 9%, which has helped it reclaim the $2 mark.
Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and Avalanche are also slightly in the green. In fact, AVAX has jumped by about 4% and now stands firmly above $10.
In contrast, ETH, BNB, XRP, and TRX have registered minor losses. Overall, though, most larger-cap alts are relatively stable on a daily scale.
Consequently, the total crypto market cap has remained still at around $1.080 trillion on CMC.

Assessing Cardano’s Struggles: Will Key Support Levels Halt The Decline Above $0.27?;"Cardano (ADA) has been on a rollercoaster ride in the cryptocurrency market, with its recent price recovery rally encountering some significant challenges. 
As of the latest data from CoinGecko, ADA is trading at $0.261, showing a modest 1.7% gain in the past 24 hours, but boasting a seven-day rally of 4.9%. However, beneath the surface, there are signs of growing overhead pressure that could limit ADA’s upward momentum.
ADA’s journey to reclaim its previous highs faces its first major hurdle at the $0.26 mark. But this is just the beginning, as multiple layers of resistance lie above it, signifying significant supplier congestion levels. The price recovery may be stalling due to these formidable barriers.
To gain a deeper understanding of ADA’s current price dynamics, we turn to a new price analysis. Data reveals a crucial level of buying interest at $0.25. In fact, over 600,000 ADA buy limit orders are placed at this level. 
This suggests that if ADA can breach the range-high and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), it might find support around the mid-range of $0.25.
On the sell side, key sell limit orders start to emerge between $0.265 and $0.270, indicating that there is substantial selling pressure just above the current price levels.

The fate of ADA’s price also hinges on Bitcoin’s performance. Should Bitcoin post losses and dip below $27,500, ADA could follow suit, potentially finding support at the mid-range of $0.25. Conversely, a bullish rally in Bitcoin could set the stage for ADA to re-target its next hurdle at $0.28.
Technical indicators are also raising caution flags for ADA investors. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50 level and trending downward, indicating fading momentum. Furthermore, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in negative territory, signaling a lack of bullish sentiment.

Considering the current market conditions and technical indicators, analysts are leaning towards a bearish outlook for Cardano’s price. There is a possibility that ADA could descend to test the support floor at $0.2415. In a worst-case scenario, the price could plummet further, potentially reaching the range low of $0.2200, marking a substantial 15% drop from its current levels.
While Cardano has shown resilience with its recent gains, the road ahead is riddled with resistance levels, and Bitcoin’s influence remains a significant factor. Investors should closely monitor the developments in ADA’s price, as it navigates through these challenging market conditions. The cryptocurrency landscape is as unpredictable as ever, and ADA’s journey is far from certain.

"Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025!";"The post Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The bitcoin price trend is no less than ‘hot pancakes’ which is gaining global attention. The rise or fall in price is not restricted to demand and supply, as the institutions and whales, along with the market makers, do have a significant impact on it. After the collapse of Terra & FTX, the markets appeared to be uncertain and not in recovery mode for the next few months. However, the emergence of institutions in the crypto space lifted the momentum, which made the market participants optimistic about the future growth of the BTC price and the entire market.
It’s more clear that Bitcoin is fueling up for one of the most phenomenal runs in history. The major reason for being bullish on Bitcoin could be:
Considering these factors, industry experts believe the BTC price may witness a huge bull run over the next 18 months. After claiming a huge inflow of $150B to $200B in Bitcoin through the BlackRock ETF, the director of the firm is now confident of all the ETFs being approved in the next 3 to 6 months. This may transform the entire crypto space, with an elevated attention and adoption rate. 
With the growing confidence of investors and market participants, can the BTC price make it to $50,000 in 2024?
Analyzing the impact of the spot ETFs on the BTC price, a popular crypto proponent and influencer, tedtalksmacro, shared some context. Presently, the FDV, or fully diluted value, of Bitcoin, which is a product of maximum supply and current market price, is around $580 billion amidst the depths of the bear market and the regulatory tightening of the global central banks.
If the token forms a strong base around the current price, the next leg after the ETFs could elevate the FDV to around $780 billion, which is around $37,100 per BTC. Additionally, the central banks are estimated to ease their tight vigilance in the next 12 to 24 months, which may make the markets more optimistic, which may add up to a much higher speculative premium.
If all these go well and BTC market capitalisation moves back to $1 trillion, then the price may rise to $48,000 in late 2025 or early 2026. The analysis depends on speculations and assumptions, and many more are yet to come. However, positive sentiments continue to mount up expecting a similar price rise that happened with Gold since 2004 after the SPDR ETF.

Additionally, the central banks are estimated to ease their tight vigilance in the next 12 to 24 months, which may make the markets more optimistic, which may add up to a much higher speculative premium.
If all these go well and BTC market capitalisation moves back to $1 trillion, then the price may rise to $48,000 in late 2025 or early 2026. The analysis depends on speculations and assumptions, and many more are yet to come. However, positive sentiments continue to mount up expecting a similar price rise that happened with Gold since 2004 after the SPDR ETF.

LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100? ;"The post LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100?  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Taking a sharp correction from $114 to $57 between July and September, the LTC coin price brings a death cross. Taking a sideway step to avoid further correction, the Litecoin price made an inverted head and shoulders pattern with a neckline close to the $70 mark. 
Despite such sharp correction, the market sentiments expect positive outcomes and present optimistic Litecoin price predictions.
However, the overhead supply pressure moving along with the 50-day EMA nullifies the breakout possibility by forcing the LTC price back to the $60 support zone. Currently, the LTC price aims to form a morning star pattern to ignite the positive cycle from the crucial support zone. 
As of now, LTC price is trading at $65.41 with an intraday growth of 0.93%, highlighting a reversal possibility. This positive reversal will challenge the 50-day EMA and might cross the $70 support zone to give a bullish breakout. 
Moreover, the chances of a reversal in LTC price are increasing as the overall market enters the Uptober season.
However, the lack of trend momentum and significant overhead supply warns of a consolidation range or a further correction.
Technical indicators:
DMI indicator: The ADX line is still on a downward trend, indicating a low momentum phase for Litecoin. However, the bullish turnaround in the DI lines suggests a high probability of a breakout to the upside.
EMA: Rising above the 50-day EAMA will be critical for Litecoin price to continue the recovery rally. 
Considering the Litecoin momentum increases with the Bitcoin ETF decision this October, the altcoin may form a new swing high. If the LTC price exceeds the 50-day EMA, it will highlight a bullish entry spot for sideline traders. Moreover, the 50-day EMA breakout will challenge the $70 mark before reaching the psychological mark of $100.
Alternatively, if the downtrend persists, it might break $60 to test the bullish dominance at the $50 support level.

Analyst Nicholas Merten Issues Bitcoin Alert, Says BTC Headed for a ‘Really Difficult Time’ – Here’s Why;"Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten is warning of a risk that Bitcoin (BTC) faces in the current macroeconomic environment.
Merten tells his 512,000 YouTube subscribers that over the long term, Bitcoin is going to experience a “really difficult time” as liquidity tightens.
According to the widely followed crypto analyst, Bitcoin’s price direction is heavily determined by monetary policy.
“We cannot sit here and say that Bitcoin is this hedge against money supply debasement and that it should go up when there’s new money in the system like it has been for the past decade, and then simply ignore when it’s [money supply] contracting.
Bitcoin works in the opposite effect here. It hedges that money debasement to the upside – when you print more money, Bitcoin’s value should obviously increase to some degree. And during periods of times of monetary contraction, it should struggle. It should generally be moving lower here to the downside…
Liquidity is the lifeline, it is the blood of all financial assets to continue appreciating.”
According to Merten, while Bitcoin has demonstrated some resiliency over the past couple of months, that could change if sentiment turns bearish.
“If investors who are buying up here [the $25,000 – $32,000 range], who are providing that current support while some people are selling, if they don’t see that there are enough other bulls on the market who are willing to market buy alongside them and eat up the asks on the order book and continue pushing prices higher… 
If all those who have been market buying for the past couple of months realize that there’s really not enough momentum to clear through this prior support range that’s now acting as the resistance between $28,000 and $32,000, people are going to start cashing out.”
Bitcoin is trading at $27,715 at time of writing.

Shielding Your Digital Realm: How to Protect Yourself and Crypto From SIM Swap Attacks;"In 2023, several SIM swap attacks have targeted cryptocurrency advocates and high-profile industry members, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Below is a comprehensive guide aimed at educating our readers on mitigating SIM swap attacks and safeguarding against hacks.
Recently, Bitcoin.com News reported that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin fell victim to a SIM swap attack. Moreover, this week, an Ethereum (ETH) investor suffered a SIM swap attack, losing 22 ETH on the friend.tech blockchain social media platform, which operates on the Base network. Unfortunately, a significant number of SIM swap attacks are targeting crypto investors. The subsequent walkthrough will guide our readers on how to avert a SIM swap attack.

So, what is a SIM swap attack? A SIM swap attack is a type of fraud in which a malicious actor deceives a mobile carrier into transferring the victim’s phone number to a new SIM card controlled by the attacker. Once the phone number is transferred, the attacker can receive the victim’s calls and text messages, including sensitive authentication codes sent via SMS for two-factor authentication (2FA).

This breach enables the attacker to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to the victim’s online accounts, such as email, crypto exchange accounts, and social media profiles, leading to potential financial loss and identity theft. While mitigation efforts are never 100% effective, there are several strategies individuals can employ to combat SIM swap breaches.
The first step is essentially online vigilance by being cautious of phishing emails and other tactics used by attackers to gain access to your personal information. Further enhanced vigilance includes avoiding responses to suspicious communications such as unknown texts, emails, and phone calls. The second measure is to leverage strong and unique passwords that protect each online account. Third, the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended, and veering away from an SMS text message or email-based 2FA is also advisable. It’s wise to use stronger multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods such as standalone authentication applications, biometrics, or physical security keys.
Another protective method, and one of the most important, is to engage in security measures by contacting your telephone carrier. With specific carriers, you can request additional security measures on your account. Users can also establish a unique PIN or passcode with their carrier, which adds an extra layer of security. Some telephone line carriers offer SIM protection features that add extra security to prevent SIM swap fraud. If you don’t contact your telephone carrier, you may miss out on some of the security measures that could prevent a SIM swap attack.
Another measure is to avoid using your telephone number for social media applications like X (formerly Twitter) and other online platforms and applications. Alongside your phone number, be cautious about sharing personal information online as every piece of evidence a hacker can gather is useful to crack online accounts. For services that require a phone number for verification or communication, consider using a secondary number or a virtual phone number service like Google Voice.
By following these steps, you can avoid a SIM swap attack and protect your finances and personal information. SIM-swapping attacks have been increasing in frequency in recent years, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning in March 2023 about the rise of SIM-swapping attacks, which have resulted in millions of dollars in losses.

BNB Price Prediction – Bears Aim Nasty Drop Below $200, Here’s Why;"BNB price (Binance coin) is still struggling to clear the $220 resistance against the US Dollar. The price could decline heavily below the $210 and $202 support levels.
This past week, BNB price attempted a recovery wave above the $210 level. The price was able to clear the $215 resistance zone. However, it failed to clear the $220 resistance.
There was a fresh decline in BNB, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price declined below the $215 support level. The bears pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high.

The next resistance sits near the $215 level. A clear move above the $215 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test the main resistance at $220-$222. A close above the $222 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance.
If BNB fails to clear the $215 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $210 level. The next major support is near the $207 level.
If there is a downside break below the $207 support, the price could drop toward the $202 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $165 level.

Bitdeer grows Bitcoin production by 195% YoY with a 35% September increase in BTC mined;"Singapore-based Bitdeer Technologies Group revealed a notable surge in mined Bitcoins in September 2023.
482 Bitcoins were mined, nearly tripling the numbers from the same time last year. Additionally, the Gedu mining data center alone produced 217 Bitcoins, accounting for approximately 45% of the total mined Bitcoins in September.
The increase is primarily attributed to the company’s operational efficiency, strategic business focus, and the stable operations of its newly constructed Gedu mining data center in Bhutan.
Bitdeer CEO Linghui Kong emphasized the company’s operational strength, which yielded robust results, with Bitcoin mining through their self-mining business experiencing an impressive 25.8% increment compared to the previous month.
According to Kong, the firm’s self-mining success is due to Bitdeer maintaining its aggregate electrical capacity at a steady 895MW. Highlighting the broader implications of these operational efficiencies, Kong stated,
“As we move into the remainder of the year, we are confident that our emphasis on strategic business development will bolster our results and help us generate long-term value for our shareholders.”
Beyond self-mining, Bitdeer’s operations span across three main business lines. These include Hash Rate Sharing, primarily involving Cloud Hash Rate, where Bitdeer offers hash rate subscription plans and shares mining income with customers. Hosting is a comprehensive mining machine hosting solution inclusive of deployment, maintenance, and management services for efficient cryptocurrency mining.
Bitdeer’s operations update indicated that the total hash rate under management as of Sep. 30 was 21.2 EH/s across the three primary business lines, with the proprietary hash rate at 8.7 EH/s. Bitdeer has 221,000 mining machines under management.
Bitdeer is not only expanding its Bitcoin mining capabilities but also its infrastructure. The company is steadily constructing a 175MW immersion cooling data center at its mining facility in Tydal, Norway. This expansion is part of Bitdeer’s concerted efforts to enhance its infrastructure and expand capacity. Completion of the Tydal Datacenter is expected in 2025.
As an industry player, Bitdeer’s operational updates offer an insightful glimpse into the dynamics of the cryptocurrency mining industry. The firm’s focus on optimizing operations, expanding infrastructure, and engaging in strategic business development is the backbone of its growth, offering valuable lessons for other organizations in the crypto space.
With mining data centers deployed in the United States, Norway, and Bhutan, Bitdeer continues providing its customers with comprehensive digital asset mining solutions.

Bitcoin Stopped at $28K, Toncoin Explodes 9% Daily (Market Watch);"Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down the $28,000 mark but was quickly stopped in its tracks and has returned to $27,500.
Most altcoins are trading sideways, with ADA and SOL gaining a few percentages, while ETH and BNB have retraced slightly.
Bitcoin initiated a massive leg up at the start of the week after a slow weekend that drove it from $27,000 to a multi-week peak at $28,600. As the community was anticipating the restart of the bull run, the cryptocurrency started losing value.
In a matter of a day, the asset lost just over a grand and went back below $27,500 until Thursday. That’s when another offensive arrived, and BTC soared to just over $28,000.
Nevertheless, it failed to continue upwards once again. The subsequent rejection pushed it back down by nearly a grand this time. As a result, bitcoin currently trades at around $27,500.
Its market capitalization has lost some ground, expectedly, and is down below $540 billion on CMC. its dominance over the altcoins, on the other hand, has increased slightly to 49.6%.
As reported yesterday, Toncoin, which was a massive gainer at the end of September, had lost its momentum with the start of the new month. However, the trending altcoin has gone back on the offensive in the past 24 hours. TON is up by approximately 9%, which has helped it reclaim the $2 mark.
Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and Avalanche are also slightly in the green. In fact, AVAX has jumped by about 4% and now stands firmly above $10.
In contrast, ETH, BNB, XRP, and TRX have registered minor losses. Overall, though, most larger-cap alts are relatively stable on a daily scale.
Consequently, the total crypto market cap has remained still at around $1.080 trillion on CMC.

Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down the $28,000 mark but was quickly stopped in its tracks and has returned to $27,500.
Most altcoins are trading sideways, with ADA and SOL gaining a few percentages, while ETH and BNB have retraced slightly.
Bitcoin initiated a massive leg up at the start of the week after a slow weekend that drove it from $27,000 to a multi-week peak at $28,600. As the community was anticipating the restart of the bull run, the cryptocurrency started losing value.
In a matter of a day, the asset lost just over a grand and went back below $27,500 until Thursday. That’s when another offensive arrived, and BTC soared to just over $28,000.
Nevertheless, it failed to continue upwards once again. The subsequent rejection pushed it back down by nearly a grand this time. As a result, bitcoin currently trades at around $27,500.
Its market capitalization has lost some ground, expectedly, and is down below $540 billion on CMC. its dominance over the altcoins, on the other hand, has increased slightly to 49.6%.

Assessing Cardano’s Struggles: Will Key Support Levels Halt The Decline Above $0.27?;"Cardano (ADA) has been on a rollercoaster ride in the cryptocurrency market, with its recent price recovery rally encountering some significant challenges. 
As of the latest data from CoinGecko, ADA is trading at $0.261, showing a modest 1.7% gain in the past 24 hours, but boasting a seven-day rally of 4.9%. However, beneath the surface, there are signs of growing overhead pressure that could limit ADA’s upward momentum.
ADA’s journey to reclaim its previous highs faces its first major hurdle at the $0.26 mark. But this is just the beginning, as multiple layers of resistance lie above it, signifying significant supplier congestion levels. The price recovery may be stalling due to these formidable barriers.
To gain a deeper understanding of ADA’s current price dynamics, we turn to a new price analysis. Data reveals a crucial level of buying interest at $0.25. In fact, over 600,000 ADA buy limit orders are placed at this level. 
This suggests that if ADA can breach the range-high and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), it might find support around the mid-range of $0.25.
On the sell side, key sell limit orders start to emerge between $0.265 and $0.270, indicating that there is substantial selling pressure just above the current price levels.

The fate of ADA’s price also hinges on Bitcoin’s performance. Should Bitcoin post losses and dip below $27,500, ADA could follow suit, potentially finding support at the mid-range of $0.25. Conversely, a bullish rally in Bitcoin could set the stage for ADA to re-target its next hurdle at $0.28.
Technical indicators are also raising caution flags for ADA investors. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50 level and trending downward, indicating fading momentum. Furthermore, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in negative territory, signaling a lack of bullish sentiment.

Considering the current market conditions and technical indicators, analysts are leaning towards a bearish outlook for Cardano’s price. There is a possibility that ADA could descend to test the support floor at $0.2415. In a worst-case scenario, the price could plummet further, potentially reaching the range low of $0.2200, marking a substantial 15% drop from its current levels.
While Cardano has shown resilience with its recent gains, the road ahead is riddled with resistance levels, and Bitcoin’s influence remains a significant factor. Investors should closely monitor the developments in ADA’s price, as it navigates through these challenging market conditions. The cryptocurrency landscape is as unpredictable as ever, and ADA’s journey is far from certain.

"Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025!";"The post Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The bitcoin price trend is no less than ‘hot pancakes’ which is gaining global attention. The rise or fall in price is not restricted to demand and supply, as the institutions and whales, along with the market makers, do have a significant impact on it. After the collapse of Terra & FTX, the markets appeared to be uncertain and not in recovery mode for the next few months. However, the emergence of institutions in the crypto space lifted the momentum, which made the market participants optimistic about the future growth of the BTC price and the entire market.
It’s more clear that Bitcoin is fueling up for one of the most phenomenal runs in history. The major reason for being bullish on Bitcoin could be:
Considering these factors, industry experts believe the BTC price may witness a huge bull run over the next 18 months. After claiming a huge inflow of $150B to $200B in Bitcoin through the BlackRock ETF, the director of the firm is now confident of all the ETFs being approved in the next 3 to 6 months. This may transform the entire crypto space, with an elevated attention and adoption rate. 
With the growing confidence of investors and market participants, can the BTC price make it to $50,000 in 2024?
Analyzing the impact of the spot ETFs on the BTC price, a popular crypto proponent and influencer, tedtalksmacro, shared some context. Presently, the FDV, or fully diluted value, of Bitcoin, which is a product of maximum supply and current market price, is around $580 billion amidst the depths of the bear market and the regulatory tightening of the global central banks.
If the token forms a strong base around the current price, the next leg after the ETFs could elevate the FDV to around $780 billion, which is around $37,100 per BTC. Additionally, the central banks are estimated to ease their tight vigilance in the next 12 to 24 months, which may make the markets more optimistic, which may add up to a much higher speculative premium.
If all these go well and BTC market capitalisation moves back to $1 trillion, then the price may rise to $48,000 in late 2025 or early 2026. The analysis depends on speculations and assumptions, and many more are yet to come. However, positive sentiments continue to mount up expecting a similar price rise that happened with Gold since 2004 after the SPDR ETF.

LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100? ;"The post LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100?  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Taking a sharp correction from $114 to $57 between July and September, the LTC coin price brings a death cross. Taking a sideway step to avoid further correction, the Litecoin price made an inverted head and shoulders pattern with a neckline close to the $70 mark. 
Despite such sharp correction, the market sentiments expect positive outcomes and present optimistic Litecoin price predictions.
However, the overhead supply pressure moving along with the 50-day EMA nullifies the breakout possibility by forcing the LTC price back to the $60 support zone. Currently, the LTC price aims to form a morning star pattern to ignite the positive cycle from the crucial support zone. 
As of now, LTC price is trading at $65.41 with an intraday growth of 0.93%, highlighting a reversal possibility. This positive reversal will challenge the 50-day EMA and might cross the $70 support zone to give a bullish breakout. 
Moreover, the chances of a reversal in LTC price are increasing as the overall market enters the Uptober season.
However, the lack of trend momentum and significant overhead supply warns of a consolidation range or a further correction.
Technical indicators:
DMI indicator: The ADX line is still on a downward trend, indicating a low momentum phase for Litecoin. However, the bullish turnaround in the DI lines suggests a high probability of a breakout to the upside.
EMA: Rising above the 50-day EAMA will be critical for Litecoin price to continue the recovery rally. 
Considering the Litecoin momentum increases with the Bitcoin ETF decision this October, the altcoin may form a new swing high. If the LTC price exceeds the 50-day EMA, it will highlight a bullish entry spot for sideline traders. Moreover, the 50-day EMA breakout will challenge the $70 mark before reaching the psychological mark of $100.
Alternatively, if the downtrend persists, it might break $60 to test the bullish dominance at the $50 support level.

Important Update to 25 Trading Pairs on Binance;"TL;DR
The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange – Binance – announced that it will complete adjustments for the tick size (the minimum change in the unit price) of various spot trading pairs by October 10, 2023. The update will not affect existing spot orders and other relevant functions. 
Some of the trading pairs that will be the subject of adjustment include APE/BNB, APE/ETH, APR/TRY, CAKE/BNB, CAKE/BTC, COTI/BUSD, COTI/USDT, WAVES/BTC, WAVES/TRY, and many more. All together, the trading pairs Binance will touch upon are 25, and the updated tick size can be observed here.
“Please adjust your trading strategies accordingly to avoid unnecessary impact on your trading. We apologize for any inconvenience,” the company advised.
Besides the aforementioned changes, Binance also informed that it will remove 19 trading pairs on October 6. Namely, those are 1INCH/BUSD, AERGO/BUSD, ANKR/BUSD, DATA/BUSD, DIA/BUSD, ERN/BUSD, IOST/BUSD, KP3R/BUSD, LOKA/BUSD, LRC/BUSD, LTO/BUSD, MDX/BUSD, OM/BUSD, POLYX/BUSD, RARE/BUSD, SLP/BUSD, SUSHI/BUSD, THETA/BUSD, and YFI/BUSD.
The firm did not provide the exact reason for the upcoming delisting but asserted that it constantly observes the market to “protect users:”
“Binance conducts periodic reviews of all listed spot trading pairs and may delist selected spot trading pairs due to multiple factors, such as poor liquidity and trading volume.”
It is worth mentioning that all the trading pairs involve BUSD. Binance previously disclosed that it will discontinue support for the stablecoin at the beginning of next year.

SBF Trial Day 3 – Former FTX CTO claims SBF granted Alameda Research ‘special privileges’ during witness testimony;"The third day of the trial against Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) unveiled deeper insights into the company’s financial operations and its founder’s personal habits.
In the morning session, testimony from Adam Yedidia, a college acquaintance of Bankman-Fried and a former Alameda and FTX staff member, provided a glimpse into the backend operations of FTX.
Yedidia delved into his work automating customer deposits and withdrawals, revealing a glitch that inflated FTX’s fiat@ftx.com account by a whopping $8 billion.
The prosecution shifted the court’s attention to the stark contrast between FTX’s original Hong Kong offices, which were extremely simple compared to the opulent offices and paddle tennis court in the Bahamas. Emphasizing signs of opulence, the prosecution also put forward images of SBF’s penthouse.
The defense countered the opulence argument by claiming that the penthouse was a shared living arrangement, while the offices were a sign of the crypto market’s success during that period. They added that SBF did not own a yacht and drove a Toyota Corolla, arguing that he led a simple life and the prosecution’s claims of opulence were unfounded.
An anecdote about SBF’s preference for sleeping on a bean bag chair in Hong Kong, which occasionally turned into naps in the Bahamas, provided a lighter moment in the proceedings.
The afternoon session was marked by Matt Huang’s testimony, co-founder of Paradigm, a significant investor in FTX. Huang’s testimony highlighted his concerns about FTX’s lack of a traditional governance structure and potential favorable conditions for Alameda Research.
Gary Wang, FTX’s Chief Technology Officer, admitted to financial misconduct during his tenure at FTX during his testimony. He further discussed specific privileges allegedly granted to Alameda Research on SBF’s instruction.
Judge Lewis Kaplan didn’t shy away from intervening, reproaching the defense on several occasions for repetitive lines of questioning, especially during Yedidia’s cross-examination.
Off the stand, the day was peppered with mentions of a book, “Number Go Up” by Zeke Faux, which narrates SBF’s descent in the crypto industry.
The trial, drawing national attention, is set to continue with Wang’s testimony and indications from the prosecution that subsequent witnesses will include industry heavyweights like BlockFi CEO Zac Prince and Elan Dekel from Pinecone.
Federal prosecutors have targeted two private jets, a Bombardier Global 5000 and an Embraer Legacy, linked to cryptocurrency executive Sam Bankman-Fried.
The aircraft, worth a combined $70 million, might be confiscated due to its connection to alleged illicit activities by Bankman-Fried. The crypto executive, who is currently on trial, has denied all charges against him.
US-based employees of FTX reportedly discovered a secret backdoor in the exchange’s system that allowed Alameda Research to access customer funds.
This revelation has raised concerns and skepticism, especially with Alameda’s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, and other executives acknowledging the use of these funds.
Creditors of the now-bankrupt FTX are optimistic as Google considers a $2B investment in AI firm Anthropic. Previously, FTX and Alameda Research had invested a combined $500M in Anthropic.
If this new investment comes to fruition, it could significantly raise the value of FTX’s stake, aiding in compensating the exchange’s defunct users.
The individual responsible for exploiting FTX has converted another $25M of stolen Ethereum to Bitcoin. The conversion was executed via THORChain Router, with the exploiter now having converted a total of $100M since the hack in January 2023.
These moves have coincided with the commencement of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial, sparking speculation that an insider may have been involved in the hack.

The third day of the trial against Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) unveiled deeper insights into the company’s financial operations and its founder’s personal habits.
In the morning session, testimony from Adam Yedidia, a college acquaintance of Bankman-Fried and a former Alameda and FTX staff member, provided a glimpse into the backend operations of FTX.
Yedidia delved into his work automating customer deposits and withdrawals, revealing a glitch that inflated FTX’s fiat@ftx.com account by a whopping $8 billion.
The prosecution shifted the court’s attention to the stark contrast between FTX’s original Hong Kong offices, which were extremely simple compared to the opulent offices and paddle tennis court in the Bahamas. Emphasizing signs of opulence, the prosecution also put forward images of SBF’s penthouse.
The defense countered the opulence argument by claiming that the penthouse was a shared living arrangement, while the offices were a sign of the crypto market’s success during that period. They added that SBF did not own a yacht and drove a Toyota Corolla, arguing that he led a simple life and the prosecution’s claims of opulence were unfounded.
An anecdote about SBF’s preference for sleeping on a bean bag chair in Hong Kong, which occasionally turned into naps in the Bahamas, provided a lighter moment in the proceedings.
The afternoon session was marked by Matt Huang’s testimony, co-founder of Paradigm, a significant investor in FTX. Huang’s testimony highlighted his concerns about FTX’s lack of a traditional governance structure and potential favorable conditions for Alameda Research.
Gary Wang, FTX’s Chief Technology Officer, admitted to financial misconduct during his tenure at FTX during his testimony. He further discussed specific privileges allegedly granted to Alameda Research on SBF’s instruction.
Judge Lewis Kaplan didn’t shy away from intervening, reproaching the defense on several occasions for repetitive lines of questioning, especially during Yedidia’s cross-examination.
Off the stand, the day was peppered with mentions of a book, “Number Go Up” by Zeke Faux, which narrates SBF’s descent in the crypto industry.
The trial, drawing national attention, is set to continue with Wang’s testimony and indications from the prosecution that subsequent witnesses will include industry heavyweights like BlockFi CEO Zac Prince and Elan Dekel from Pinecone.
Federal prosecutors have targeted two private jets, a Bombardier Global 5000 and an Embraer Legacy, linked to cryptocurrency executive Sam Bankman-Fried.
The aircraft, worth a combined $70 million, might be confiscated due to its connection to alleged illicit activities by Bankman-Fried. The crypto executive, who is currently on trial, has denied all charges against him.
US-based employees of FTX reportedly discovered a secret backdoor in the exchange’s system that allowed Alameda Research to access customer funds.
This revelation has raised concerns and skepticism, especially with Alameda’s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, and other executives acknowledging the use of these funds.
Creditors of the now-bankrupt FTX are optimistic as Google considers a $2B investment in AI firm Anthropic. Previously, FTX and Alameda Research had invested a combined $500M in Anthropic.

Binance Exchange Spot Market Share Falls to 34%: A Closer Look;"The post Binance Exchange Spot Market Share Falls to 34%: A Closer Look appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Binance, once the dominant force in the cryptocurrency exchange space, has experienced a seven-month decline in its spot market share, which now stands at just 34%, according to CCData, as reported by Bloomberg. 
Since August, Binance has seen withdrawals totaling around $12,230 BTC, or $330 million, and around 198,200 Ethereum (ETH), or $323 million. Bitcoin constitutes nearly half the $1 trillion crypto industry, while Ether accounts for about 20%.
However, as per K33 research, Binance’s trading volumes have also plummeted, with a 57% decline in the 7-day average trading volume for Bitcoin since the beginning of September. In contrast, other exchanges, including U.S.-based Coinbase, have maintained more stable volumes, with Coinbase experiencing a 9% increase over the same period. 
Several factors have contributed to this decline. Binance’s move to offer zero-fee trading for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to attract more users and boost trading volumes initially helped the exchange. However, it has since lost its appeal as these promotions ended. This shift has led some users to explore alternative platforms.
Binance’s Legal portions have further exacerbated Binance’s troubles. The CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), faces potential criminal charges from the U.S. Justice Department, and the company has witnessed high-profile executive departures and significant layoffs, causing concerns about its future market position. 
But not all are against Binance; recently, Changpeng Zhao’s optimistic statements about the success of his Initial Coin Offering (ICO) garnered positive attention. The tokens, initially valued at 15 cents each, are now trading at $213, having reached as high as $675 in 2021. 
Currently, the BNB coin ranks as the fourth-most valuable digital asset globally, with a market worth of $33 billion. According to Forbes, Zhao’s net worth is estimated at $10 billion, but this calculation is based on the value of his business interests. It does not include the substantial amount of BNB he likely controls. 
So we can say Binance is still in the race despite a 0.87% drop in trading volume; Binance leads with $188.20 billion and 50.79% market share. Whereas the top 8 platforms controlled 91.7% of market depth and 89.5% of trading volume.
Still, cryptocurrency-related happenings will determine the crypto market’s future growth trajectory. The market has become dominated by news of the introduction of bitcoin ETFs and the selling pressure of insolvent corporations and the US government.

Shielding Your Digital Realm: How to Protect Yourself and Crypto From SIM Swap Attacks;"In 2023, several SIM swap attacks have targeted cryptocurrency advocates and high-profile industry members, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Below is a comprehensive guide aimed at educating our readers on mitigating SIM swap attacks and safeguarding against hacks.
Recently, Bitcoin.com News reported that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin fell victim to a SIM swap attack. Moreover, this week, an Ethereum (ETH) investor suffered a SIM swap attack, losing 22 ETH on the friend.tech blockchain social media platform, which operates on the Base network. Unfortunately, a significant number of SIM swap attacks are targeting crypto investors. The subsequent walkthrough will guide our readers on how to avert a SIM swap attack.

So, what is a SIM swap attack? A SIM swap attack is a type of fraud in which a malicious actor deceives a mobile carrier into transferring the victim’s phone number to a new SIM card controlled by the attacker. Once the phone number is transferred, the attacker can receive the victim’s calls and text messages, including sensitive authentication codes sent via SMS for two-factor authentication (2FA).

This breach enables the attacker to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to the victim’s online accounts, such as email, crypto exchange accounts, and social media profiles, leading to potential financial loss and identity theft. While mitigation efforts are never 100% effective, there are several strategies individuals can employ to combat SIM swap breaches.
The first step is essentially online vigilance by being cautious of phishing emails and other tactics used by attackers to gain access to your personal information. Further enhanced vigilance includes avoiding responses to suspicious communications such as unknown texts, emails, and phone calls. The second measure is to leverage strong and unique passwords that protect each online account. Third, the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended, and veering away from an SMS text message or email-based 2FA is also advisable. It’s wise to use stronger multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods such as standalone authentication applications, biometrics, or physical security keys.
Another protective method, and one of the most important, is to engage in security measures by contacting your telephone carrier. With specific carriers, you can request additional security measures on your account. Users can also establish a unique PIN or passcode with their carrier, which adds an extra layer of security. Some telephone line carriers offer SIM protection features that add extra security to prevent SIM swap fraud. If you don’t contact your telephone carrier, you may miss out on some of the security measures that could prevent a SIM swap attack.
Another measure is to avoid using your telephone number for social media applications like X (formerly Twitter) and other online platforms and applications. Alongside your phone number, be cautious about sharing personal information online as every piece of evidence a hacker can gather is useful to crack online accounts. For services that require a phone number for verification or communication, consider using a secondary number or a virtual phone number service like Google Voice.
By following these steps, you can avoid a SIM swap attack and protect your finances and personal information. SIM-swapping attacks have been increasing in frequency in recent years, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning in March 2023 about the rise of SIM-swapping attacks, which have resulted in millions of dollars in losses.
Have you taken steps to protect yourself from SIM swap attacks? Let us know your strategies in the comments section below.

However, it has since lost its appeal as these promotions ended. This shift has led some users to explore alternative platforms.
Binance’s Legal portions have further exacerbated Binance’s troubles. The CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), faces potential criminal charges from the U.S. Justice Department, and the company has witnessed high-profile executive departures and significant layoffs, causing concerns about its future market position. 
But not all are against Binance; recently, Changpeng Zhao’s optimistic statements about the success of his Initial Coin Offering (ICO) garnered positive attention. The tokens, initially valued at 15 cents each, are now trading at $213, having reached as high as $675 in 2021. 
Currently, the BNB coin ranks as the fourth-most valuable digital asset globally, with a market worth of $33 billion. According to Forbes, Zhao’s net worth is estimated at $10 billion, but this calculation is based on the value of his business interests. It does not include the substantial amount of BNB he likely controls. 
So we can say Binance is still in the race despite a 0.87% drop in trading volume; Binance leads with $188.20 billion and 50.79% market share. Whereas the top 8 platforms controlled 91.7% of market depth and 89.5% of trading volume.
Still, cryptocurrency-related happenings will determine the crypto market’s future growth trajectory. The market has become dominated by news of the introduction of bitcoin ETFs and the selling pressure of insolvent corporations and the US government.

Analyst Nicholas Merten Issues Bitcoin Alert, Says BTC Headed for a ‘Really Difficult Time’ – Here’s Why;"Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten is warning of a risk that Bitcoin (BTC) faces in the current macroeconomic environment.
Merten tells his 512,000 YouTube subscribers that over the long term, Bitcoin is going to experience a “really difficult time” as liquidity tightens.
According to the widely followed crypto analyst, Bitcoin’s price direction is heavily determined by monetary policy.
“We cannot sit here and say that Bitcoin is this hedge against money supply debasement and that it should go up when there’s new money in the system like it has been for the past decade, and then simply ignore when it’s [money supply] contracting.
Bitcoin works in the opposite effect here. It hedges that money debasement to the upside – when you print more money, Bitcoin’s value should obviously increase to some degree. And during periods of times of monetary contraction, it should struggle. It should generally be moving lower here to the downside…
Liquidity is the lifeline, it is the blood of all financial assets to continue appreciating.”
According to Merten, while Bitcoin has demonstrated some resiliency over the past couple of months, that could change if sentiment turns bearish.
“If investors who are buying up here [the $25,000 – $32,000 range], who are providing that current support while some people are selling, if they don’t see that there are enough other bulls on the market who are willing to market buy alongside them and eat up the asks on the order book and continue pushing prices higher… 
If all those who have been market buying for the past couple of months realize that there’s really not enough momentum to clear through this prior support range that’s now acting as the resistance between $28,000 and $32,000, people are going to start cashing out.”
Bitcoin is trading at $27,715 at time of writing.

LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100? ;"The post LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100?  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Taking a sharp correction from $114 to $57 between July and September, the LTC coin price brings a death cross. Taking a sideway step to avoid further correction, the Litecoin price made an inverted head and shoulders pattern with a neckline close to the $70 mark. 
Despite such sharp correction, the market sentiments expect positive outcomes and present optimistic Litecoin price predictions.
However, the overhead supply pressure moving along with the 50-day EMA nullifies the breakout possibility by forcing the LTC price back to the $60 support zone. Currently, the LTC price aims to form a morning star pattern to ignite the positive cycle from the crucial support zone. 
As of now, LTC price is trading at $65.41 with an intraday growth of 0.93%, highlighting a reversal possibility. This positive reversal will challenge the 50-day EMA and might cross the $70 support zone to give a bullish breakout. 
Moreover, the chances of a reversal in LTC price are increasing as the overall market enters the Uptober season.
However, the lack of trend momentum and significant overhead supply warns of a consolidation range or a further correction.
Technical indicators:
DMI indicator: The ADX line is still on a downward trend, indicating a low momentum phase for Litecoin. However, the bullish turnaround in the DI lines suggests a high probability of a breakout to the upside.
EMA: Rising above the 50-day EAMA will be critical for Litecoin price to continue the recovery rally. 
Considering the Litecoin momentum increases with the Bitcoin ETF decision this October, the altcoin may form a new swing high. If the LTC price exceeds the 50-day EMA, it will highlight a bullish entry spot for sideline traders. Moreover, the 50-day EMA breakout will challenge the $70 mark before reaching the psychological mark of $100.
Alternatively, if the downtrend persists, it might break $60 to test the bullish dominance at the $50 support level.

Shielding Your Digital Realm: How to Protect Yourself and Crypto From SIM Swap Attacks;"In 2023, several SIM swap attacks have targeted cryptocurrency advocates and high-profile industry members, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Below is a comprehensive guide aimed at educating our readers on mitigating SIM swap attacks and safeguarding against hacks.
Recently, Bitcoin.com News reported that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin fell victim to a SIM swap attack. Moreover, this week, an Ethereum (ETH) investor suffered a SIM swap attack, losing 22 ETH on the friend.tech blockchain social media platform, which operates on the Base network. Unfortunately, a significant number of SIM swap attacks are targeting crypto investors. The subsequent walkthrough will guide our readers on how to avert a SIM swap attack.

So, what is a SIM swap attack? A SIM swap attack is a type of fraud in which a malicious actor deceives a mobile carrier into transferring the victim’s phone number to a new SIM card controlled by the attacker. Once the phone number is transferred, the attacker can receive the victim’s calls and text messages, including sensitive authentication codes sent via SMS for two-factor authentication (2FA).

This breach enables the attacker to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to the victim’s online accounts, such as email, crypto exchange accounts, and social media profiles, leading to potential financial loss and identity theft. While mitigation efforts are never 100% effective, there are several strategies individuals can employ to combat SIM swap breaches.
The first step is essentially online vigilance by being cautious of phishing emails and other tactics used by attackers to gain access to your personal information. Further enhanced vigilance includes avoiding responses to suspicious communications such as unknown texts, emails, and phone calls. The second measure is to leverage strong and unique passwords that protect each online account. Third, the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended, and veering away from an SMS text message or email-based 2FA is also advisable. It’s wise to use stronger multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods such as standalone authentication applications, biometrics, or physical security keys.
Another protective method, and one of the most important, is to engage in security measures by contacting your telephone carrier. With specific carriers, you can request additional security measures on your account. Users can also establish a unique PIN or passcode with their carrier, which adds an extra layer of security. Some telephone line carriers offer SIM protection features that add extra security to prevent SIM swap fraud. If you don’t contact your telephone carrier, you may miss out on some of the security measures that could prevent a SIM swap attack.
Another measure is to avoid using your telephone number for social media applications like X (formerly Twitter) and other online platforms and applications. Alongside your phone number, be cautious about sharing personal information online as every piece of evidence a hacker can gather is useful to crack online accounts. For services that require a phone number for verification or communication, consider using a secondary number or a virtual phone number service like Google Voice.
By following these steps, you can avoid a SIM swap attack and protect your finances and personal information. SIM-swapping attacks have been increasing in frequency in recent years, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning in March 2023 about the rise of SIM-swapping attacks, which have resulted in millions of dollars in losses.

BNB Price Prediction – Bears Aim Nasty Drop Below $200, Here’s Why;"BNB price (Binance coin) is still struggling to clear the $220 resistance against the US Dollar. The price could decline heavily below the $210 and $202 support levels.
This past week, BNB price attempted a recovery wave above the $210 level. The price was able to clear the $215 resistance zone. However, it failed to clear the $220 resistance.
There was a fresh decline in BNB, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price declined below the $215 support level. The bears pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high.

The next resistance sits near the $215 level. A clear move above the $215 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test the main resistance at $220-$222. A close above the $222 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance.
If BNB fails to clear the $215 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $210 level. The next major support is near the $207 level.
If there is a downside break below the $207 support, the price could drop toward the $202 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $165 level.
Technical Indicators
4-Hours MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone.
4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level.

Bitcoin is trading at $27,715 at time of writing.

THORSwap Temporarily Suspended Due to Rise in Potentially Illicit Funds!;"The post THORSwap Temporarily Suspended Due to Rise in Potentially Illicit Funds! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Thorswap, a decentralized exchange based on ThorChain, is temporarily transitioning into maintenance mode due to a rise in potentially illicit funds moving through the platform. This move comes after the FTX hacker transferred 22,500 ETH ($38 million) this week, including swapping ether for bitcoin through ThorChain. Thorswap consulted with legal experts, advisors, and law enforcement agencies and will remain in maintenance mode until a more permanent and robust solution can be implemented. The FTX hacker holds over 163,000 ETH ($275 million) in ether across several wallets and is known for suspicious withdrawals from the collapsed crypto exchange FTX.

The bitcoin price trend is no less than ‘hot pancakes’ which is gaining global attention. The rise or fall in price is not restricted to demand and supply, as the institutions and whales, along with the market makers, do have a significant impact on it. After the collapse of Terra & FTX, the markets appeared to be uncertain and not in recovery mode for the next few months. However, the emergence of institutions in the crypto space lifted the momentum, which made the market participants optimistic about the future growth of the BTC price and the entire market.
It’s more clear that Bitcoin is fueling up for one of the most phenomenal runs in history. The major reason for being bullish on Bitcoin could be:
Considering these factors, industry experts believe the BTC price may witness a huge bull run over the next 18 months. After claiming a huge inflow of $150B to $200B in Bitcoin through the BlackRock ETF, the director of the firm is now confident of all the ETFs being approved in the next 3 to 6 months. This may transform the entire crypto space, with an elevated attention and adoption rate. 
With the growing confidence of investors and market participants, can the BTC price make it to $50,000 in 2024?
Analyzing the impact of the spot ETFs on the BTC price, a popular crypto proponent and influencer, tedtalksmacro, shared some context. Presently, the FDV, or fully diluted value, of Bitcoin, which is a product of maximum supply and current market price, is around $580 billion amidst the depths of the bear market and the regulatory tightening of the global central banks.
If the token forms a strong base around the current price, the next leg after the ETFs could elevate the FDV to around $780 billion, which is around $37,100 per BTC. Additionally, the central banks are estimated to ease their tight vigilance in the next 12 to 24 months, which may make the markets more optimistic, which may add up to a much higher speculative premium.
If all these go well and BTC market capitalisation moves back to $1 trillion, then the price may rise to $48,000 in late 2025 or early 2026. The analysis depends on speculations and assumptions, and many more are yet to come. However, positive sentiments continue to mount up expecting a similar price rise that happened with Gold since 2004 after the SPDR ETF.

Bitdeer grows Bitcoin production by 195% YoY with a 35% September increase in BTC mined;"Singapore-based Bitdeer Technologies Group revealed a notable surge in mined Bitcoins in September 2023.
482 Bitcoins were mined, nearly tripling the numbers from the same time last year. Additionally, the Gedu mining data center alone produced 217 Bitcoins, accounting for approximately 45% of the total mined Bitcoins in September.
The increase is primarily attributed to the company’s operational efficiency, strategic business focus, and the stable operations of its newly constructed Gedu mining data center in Bhutan.
Bitdeer CEO Linghui Kong emphasized the company’s operational strength, which yielded robust results, with Bitcoin mining through their self-mining business experiencing an impressive 25.8% increment compared to the previous month.
According to Kong, the firm’s self-mining success is due to Bitdeer maintaining its aggregate electrical capacity at a steady 895MW. Highlighting the broader implications of these operational efficiencies, Kong stated,
“As we move into the remainder of the year, we are confident that our emphasis on strategic business development will bolster our results and help us generate long-term value for our shareholders.”
Beyond self-mining, Bitdeer’s operations span across three main business lines. These include Hash Rate Sharing, primarily involving Cloud Hash Rate, where Bitdeer offers hash rate subscription plans and shares mining income with customers. Hosting is a comprehensive mining machine hosting solution inclusive of deployment, maintenance, and management services for efficient cryptocurrency mining.
Bitdeer’s operations update indicated that the total hash rate under management as of Sep. 30 was 21.2 EH/s across the three primary business lines, with the proprietary hash rate at 8.7 EH/s. Bitdeer has 221,000 mining machines under management.
Bitdeer is not only expanding its Bitcoin mining capabilities but also its infrastructure. The company is steadily constructing a 175MW immersion cooling data center at its mining facility in Tydal, Norway. This expansion is part of Bitdeer’s concerted efforts to enhance its infrastructure and expand capacity. Completion of the Tydal Datacenter is expected in 2025.
As an industry player, Bitdeer’s operational updates offer an insightful glimpse into the dynamics of the cryptocurrency mining industry. The firm’s focus on optimizing operations, expanding infrastructure, and engaging in strategic business development is the backbone of its growth, offering valuable lessons for other organizations in the crypto space.
With mining data centers deployed in the United States, Norway, and Bhutan, Bitdeer continues providing its customers with comprehensive digital asset mining solutions.

Bitcoin Stopped at $28K, Toncoin Explodes 9% Daily (Market Watch);"Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down the $28,000 mark but was quickly stopped in its tracks and has returned to $27,500.
Most altcoins are trading sideways, with ADA and SOL gaining a few percentages, while ETH and BNB have retraced slightly.
Bitcoin initiated a massive leg up at the start of the week after a slow weekend that drove it from $27,000 to a multi-week peak at $28,600. As the community was anticipating the restart of the bull run, the cryptocurrency started losing value.
In a matter of a day, the asset lost just over a grand and went back below $27,500 until Thursday. That’s when another offensive arrived, and BTC soared to just over $28,000.
Nevertheless, it failed to continue upwards once again. The subsequent rejection pushed it back down by nearly a grand this time. As a result, bitcoin currently trades at around $27,500.
Its market capitalization has lost some ground, expectedly, and is down below $540 billion on CMC. its dominance over the altcoins, on the other hand, has increased slightly to 49.6%.
As reported yesterday, Toncoin, which was a massive gainer at the end of September, had lost its momentum with the start of the new month. However, the trending altcoin has gone back on the offensive in the past 24 hours. TON is up by approximately 9%, which has helped it reclaim the $2 mark.
Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and Avalanche are also slightly in the green. In fact, AVAX has jumped by about 4% and now stands firmly above $10.
In contrast, ETH, BNB, XRP, and TRX have registered minor losses. Overall, though, most larger-cap alts are relatively stable on a daily scale.
Consequently, the total crypto market cap has remained still at around $1.080 trillion on CMC.

Assessing Cardano’s Struggles: Will Key Support Levels Halt The Decline Above $0.27?;"Cardano (ADA) has been on a rollercoaster ride in the cryptocurrency market, with its recent price recovery rally encountering some significant challenges. 
As of the latest data from CoinGecko, ADA is trading at $0.261, showing a modest 1.7% gain in the past 24 hours, but boasting a seven-day rally of 4.9%. However, beneath the surface, there are signs of growing overhead pressure that could limit ADA’s upward momentum.
ADA’s journey to reclaim its previous highs faces its first major hurdle at the $0.26 mark. But this is just the beginning, as multiple layers of resistance lie above it, signifying significant supplier congestion levels. The price recovery may be stalling due to these formidable barriers.
To gain a deeper understanding of ADA’s current price dynamics, we turn to a new price analysis. Data reveals a crucial level of buying interest at $0.25. In fact, over 600,000 ADA buy limit orders are placed at this level. 
This suggests that if ADA can breach the range-high and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), it might find support around the mid-range of $0.25.
On the sell side, key sell limit orders start to emerge between $0.265 and $0.270, indicating that there is substantial selling pressure just above the current price levels.

The fate of ADA’s price also hinges on Bitcoin’s performance. Should Bitcoin post losses and dip below $27,500, ADA could follow suit, potentially finding support at the mid-range of $0.25. Conversely, a bullish rally in Bitcoin could set the stage for ADA to re-target its next hurdle at $0.28.
Technical indicators are also raising caution flags for ADA investors. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50 level and trending downward, indicating fading momentum. Furthermore, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in negative territory, signaling a lack of bullish sentiment.

Considering the current market conditions and technical indicators, analysts are leaning towards a bearish outlook for Cardano’s price. There is a possibility that ADA could descend to test the support floor at $0.2415. In a worst-case scenario, the price could plummet further, potentially reaching the range low of $0.2200, marking a substantial 15% drop from its current levels.
While Cardano has shown resilience with its recent gains, the road ahead is riddled with resistance levels, and Bitcoin’s influence remains a significant factor. Investors should closely monitor the developments in ADA’s price, as it navigates through these challenging market conditions. The cryptocurrency landscape is as unpredictable as ever, and ADA’s journey is far from certain.
