ThorChain Hits Record-Setting $355 Million Trading Volume in a Day;"ThorChain, a decentralized liquidity protocol, reported a record-breaking transaction volume on Oct. 5, with the number surging to $355 million in a single day, marking an all-time high.
This noteworthy event is part of a larger trend as the cumulative transaction volume over the past five days has surpassed the $1 billion mark.
According to the analysis, the surge in transaction volume coincided with the rise in swap counts associated with the network. On Oct. 5, when the transaction volume was close to $355 million, the count of swaps related to the network was 115,630.
This was an upward surge compared to the preceding day, when the swap count was 61,877, and the total volume was merely $170.8 million.
The daily change in transaction volume from Oct. 4 to Oct. 5 was a massive 107.6% increase.
A look at the charts indicates an upward trajectory in the transaction volumes since Sept. 29. While the network reported just about $34.45 million as total volume on Sept. 29, the value increased to $60.14 million the next day and $166.4 by Oct. 1.
Later, on Oct. 2, the total transaction volume made a new high of $197.33 million before minor plunges were noted at $173.84 million and $170.84 million between Oct. 3 and 4, respectively. Between Oct. 1 and 5, the cumulative transaction volume was $1.063 billion.
As the transaction volumes seemingly surged, so did the earnings volume associated with the network. On Oct. 4, the liquidity earning was about $109K, and the bond earning stood at $66.7K, a major decline from the highs recorded on Oct. 2. However, on Oct. 5, the liquidity and bond earnings stood at $164.35K and $101.96K, respectively.
As per analysts, the sudden volume surge can be linked to increased hacking activities recently, especially with cross-chain BTC transactions being the main contributor to the massive volume surge.
To address these adverse events, reports indicate that ThorSwap, a product of ThorChain, has paused the platform, shifting into maintenance mode.
When speaking of the developments, ThorSwap developer tweeted;
“Yesterday, following a careful evaluation of the situation and consultation with advisors, legal counsel, and law enforcement, the decision was made to temporarily transition the THORSwap interface into maintenance mode. This action was taken to swiftly curtail any further potential illicit activity.”
Fellow THORChads,
A pressing and persistent concern has recently come to light: the potential movement of illicit funds through THORChain and, specifically, THORSwap. Such activities have no place on the THORSwap platform, and THORSwap stands firmly against any and all criminal…
— THORSwap  #BetterThanCEX (@THORSwap) October 6, 2023

The tweet noted that ThorSwap will remain in this mode till the developers find a more permanent solution to implement and bolster the platform’s continued security and integrity.
The native token of the ThorChain network, Rune, has been trading in the red for most of the past 24 hours. Starting the day at 2.048, the token surged to $2.1 before plunging to a low of about $1.93. Reports indicate that the token has lost about 2,51% in value in the 24 hours from October 5 till the reporting time.
However, the story is quite different in the past seven days, with Rune trading in the green. Starting at $1.92 on Sept. 29, Rune surged to a high of $2.23 on Oct. 2 before falling to a low of $1.88 on Oct. 4.
The charts suggest that the assets have mainly shown a sideways price action, especially in the past five days. However, in the past week, Rune has gained about 3.02% in value.

‘Trading Through Gamification Can Represent the Future’ Says Banksters’ Alexandru Carbunariu;"While centralized exchanges (cexs) are instrumental in helping new users grasp all things crypto, they nevertheless do not go “the extra mile in educating their audience properly,” Alexandru Carbunariu, the CMO at the edutech simulator Banksters, has asserted. According to Carbunariu, a Web3 advisor, properly educating newbies includes making the experience more interactive and fun. He added that Web3 platforms should take a leaf out of their Web2 counterparts’ playbook.
Expanding on the argument that education should be more fun, the CMO said he concurred with those who believe gamification to be the right way of encouraging more positive trading behavior. However, Carbunariu told Bitcoin.com News that while “trading through gamification may represent the future,” many of the current Web3 games may “have taken a wrong turn.”
When asked for his thoughts on the so-called trade-to-win strategy, the Banksters CMO insisted that such a model is better than play-to-earn (P2E) models because it engenders confidence. He suggested that such a model can be ideal for newcomers. Meanwhile, in written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, Carbunariu also articulated why competition is necessary for Web3 platforms looking to get communities attached to their respective products.
Below are Alexandru Carbunariu‘s responses to all questions sent.
Bitcoin.com News (BCN): Centralized exchanges (cexs) are one of the gateways to all things crypto for new users and most of them have taken on the job of educating newcomers. In your opinion, what can they do better or differently to bring in more Web2 users via education?
Alexandru Carbunariu (AC): Speaking from experience, centralized exchanges don’t take the extra mile in educating their audience properly. A lot more things should be done in terms of education, to make it more fun, more rewarding as well as more interactive. We should check what Web2 asset platforms do and get inspired by their work. We rarely see that in Web3. However, we believe that with new regulations, specific training models will come up.
What needs to be done in order to attract Web2 users:
Create interactive training that will provide incentives (like we have seen Revolut doing).
Use normal KOLs [key opinion leaders] to present their products in a transparent [way] but also using normal non-technical language.
Try to introduce academy programs, where normal users can attend, therefore the knowledge will be much higher. Provide transparency when involving risks. Introduce alerts when the user is lost in the complex UX / UI of the platform.
BCN: Do you believe gamification is the right approach to encouraging positive crypto trading behavior with long-term benefits?
AC: Of course. Creating a more fun environment can be relaxing for the user, and if you don’t mix that with financial loss, it’s actually perfect. We are one of the first to build this type of concept. Our A/B tests, focus groups as well user validation were high, meaning that we were on the right track.
I believe that the Web3 games have taken a wrong turn, and the project owners have lost focus. Web3 should be the gateway to the future and it should provide new ways, apart from the traditional ones, in order to onboard as many users.
Trading through gamification can represent the future. First users need to understand it, then they will trade or invest with caution. If their first experience provides them with losses, then they are unlikely to come back. This is why Banksters has stepped in and is helping them to understand more about crypto, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and trading.

BCN: Can you describe what the trade-to-win model is all about and how this differs from play-to-earn?
AC: In the past 2-3 years we have seen the “P2E” as well as the “P&E” types. One thing they have in common is the fact that they have not identified a balance that will give them a much-needed token stability.
Our Trade2Win model lets the user:
First test the product
Learn about the product
Play around with it
And become a winner
This is the model that provides more confidence, and the rewards will come only at the end, meaning if you are a winner then the rewards will be won. This is a more or less “shadow” plan from the trading world, where you need to practice, learn, trade and then gain profits.
BCN: Trading is an umbrella term that encompasses various strategies based on an individual’s mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors. How does your platform help users figure out an optimal strategy for them through low-risk education?
AC: This is a very good question. To give a more of a straight answer: Yes and No. Basically, we can cover this through our so-called “Abilities” which can be compared with “Superpowers” a hero avatar has in the Web2 games. Abilities actually “copy” what is happening on the real market. There are abilities like:
Elon Musk Tweet
Vitalik’s Support
CZ’s Effect
Market Squeeze
Pump and Dump
Hype
Insider Trade
These are real-life trading events, and in many cases, traders or users don’t understand them. What Banksters did was to analyze all of the historical pricing for these events, develop a price algorithm then infuse them into these Abilities.
Now the user will understand what happens to their portfolio and how it will react when these Abilities are used. This actually provides no risk for the user as well as covers a new mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors.
BCN: Whether it’s crypto trading or something else, competition is often an integral part of that. How is Banksters encouraging competition among users?
AC: They are highly competitive! We often have tournaments and live streams which reward users with real USDT. It drives them to use the product and makes them happy with both the game but also the environment.
We strongly believe that competitions, challenges, tournaments and livestreams definitely help the community being attached to the product, while the team can gather transparent and vital feedback.
BCN: When discussing factors holding back large-scale adoption of crypto, lack of education and intuitive user interface (UI) often get the most attention. However, could it be that we have not had mass adoption because the crypto ecosystem is still struggling to find the product-market fit?
AC: Another good question. The answer is pretty simple. It’s about money. However, it’s more than that. For example:
Users:
A lot of people have lost their hard-earned money during the bear market while listening to the unprepared and uneducated key opinion leaders (KOLs) who often accept to promote projects with no filters.
Project Owners:
If one puts two years and $10,000 in the right way, they could raise between $500,000 and a million dollars while having absolutely no experience in blockchain tech, development, management, marketing, or product growth. This, however, has changed and now a lot of Web2 specialists are entering the Web3 space and I believe the standard will go just higher.
Centralized Exchanges:
Providing crazy leverages, with no education, with no warning, and to top all that with FTX keeping their crypto wallet keys in a Google form.
At the end of the day, human nature had to kick in, meaning something terrible had to happen in order for something to be changed.
I think Web3 has gone through a reset in the past 2-3 years, and now, finally, we can see some highly professional projects with funding resources delivering innovative products. Such projects have higher odds of finding product-market fit and accelerating adoption.

Bitcoin And Crypto Under The Lens As Bond Market Recalls 2008 Crash;"As the global financial landscape witnesses a seismic shift, reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble burst, alarm bells are ringing in the bond market, alerting the Bitcoin and crypto market as well.
Renowned Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Genevieve Roch-Decter, highlighted the striking parallels in a recent tweet, stating, “I can’t believe I am saying this but the slump in 10-year and 30-year bonds is approaching the epic drops we saw in stocks during the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble bust.”
Bloomberg Surveillance’s Lisa Abramowicz reinforces this grim narrative, pointing out that “bonds maturing in 10 years or more have slumped 46% since peaking in March 2020, just shy of the 49% plunge in US stocks in the aftermath of the dot-com bust. The route in 30-year bonds has been even worse, tumbling 53%.”
Onramp, a Bitcoin asset management platform, adds further context by emphasizing the historic nature of the trend. This decline, particularly in bonds with maturities exceeding a decade, harkens back to market downturns like the dot-com bubble collapse. The Federal Reserve’s resolute stance on inflation and a fragile fiscal environment have disrupted the traditional appeal of long-maturity debt, raising questions about the possibility of a debt spiral.
The situation is further complicated by the behavior of the yield curve. Historically, an inverted yield curve has foreshadowed recessions. However, the recent correction has seen a rare “bear steepener,” marked by rising long-term yields. This phenomenon, seen in the past before recessions, raises concerns of an impending economic downturn.
“While some question the yield curve’s reliability as a recession indicator, the current bear steepening suggests that an economic downturn could be imminent. This is particularly concerning given the Fed’s ongoing commitment to restrictive monetary policy, making the situation ripe for potential market volatility and economic uncertainty, “ Dylan LeClair from Onramp notes.
Meanwhile, Barclays’ analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha suggests that only a stock market crash could halt the bond market’s decline. Unlike previous cycles, traditional bond backstops are dwindling, with the Fed shifting from a net buyer to a net seller, and foreign institutional buying slowing.
This highlights the stark disconnect between equity valuations and long-end bond rates, with stocks having significant room for devaluation before bonds stabilize. And if stocks crash, Bitcoin and crypto could be just as affected.
The turmoil in the bond market has far-reaching implications, including its impact on Bitcoin and crypto. Remarkably, the crypto market has never experienced such a situation, but there are general observations of how risk assets have reacted in such environments in the past.
First, rising treasury yields make risk-free returns more attractive, potentially prompting some investors to reallocate capital from risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto to treasury bills. This shift could decrease demand, putting downward pressure on their prices.
Moreover, a sharp rise in 10-year Treasury yields can signal a tighter monetary policy, weighing on risk assets. Higher yields also mean higher borrowing costs, which can impact crypto. When interest rates rise, non-interest-bearing assets like Bitcoin may seem less attractive compared to yield-bearing assets.
A significant increase in Treasury yields can also lead to reduced liquidity in other financial markets, such as the Bitcoin and crypto space. Institutional investors facing liquidity constraints may liquidate more liquid assets like BTC and altcoins causing potential price declines.
Lastly, sharp yield increases can create volatility across various asset classes as investors seek to reduce risk or cover losses elsewhere. Bitcoin and crypto are highly influenced by market sentiment and speculative behavior. The market’s interpretation of rising yields can sway investor behavior, impacting crypto prices.
Accordingly, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, recently predicted:
The 10YR is up another 10% since! […] The Fed wants more unemployment. The job market is still too strong. They’ve raised the expected 2024 rates as a result and the 10YR has broken out to new decade highs. As long as the 10YR is breaking upwards like this, risk assets are going to see further headwinds.
At press time, BTC traded at $27,576.

Crypto: 50% Users Invest To Improve Living Standards;"The crypto industry has experienced substantial expansion over the years, characterized by significant increases in both value and widespread adoption. What was once primarily associated with the dark web has transformed into a sector that is increasingly embraced by individuals worldwide. This transformation underscores the fact that crypto investments have transcended mere speculation for a significant portion of the population.
A recent survey conducted by Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, and published on Oct. 5, 2023, provides valuable insights into how digital assets are now instrumental in elevating living standards. These assets have been accomplishing various financial objectives for users around the world.
About half of crypto users, or around 50%, are directing their investments with the aim of enhancing their everyday living conditions. The survey’s findings indicate that in countries such as South Korea, Canada, and Turkey, 46%, 44%, and 41% of respondents, respectively, have identified this as their foremost financial goal when engaging in digital asset investments.
Moreover, the survey reveals that approximately 36% of participants from Malaysia and Taiwan place a higher priority on improving their family’s overall quality of life. This was when compared to other financial aspirations.
The extensive survey collected information during the period spanning from May to August. It included participation from more than 1,500 individuals representing 20 countries across Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, the United States, and Canada. 
Notably, the survey also illuminated diverse motivations among female crypto investors in different nations. For instance, in the United States and Turkey, around 27% of female crypto investors have their investment in crypto. It is mostly driven by the desire to finance their children’s education. In contrast, this particular goal was less prevalent in South Korea and Japan. Only 5% of female investors expressed the same aspiration.

In terms of Chinese involvement, the survey provided insights into the extent of engagement among crypto users in China. Despite the prohibition on crypto trading within the country, the survey findings suggest that Chinese citizens are actively in the crypto market.
A significant 18% of survey respondents from China stated that they had invested amounts ranging from $50,000 to $100,000. Amidst this, an additional 19% had committed investments between $100,000 and $500,000. It’s worth noting that Chinese nationals can still possess cryptocurrencies and navigate around the trading ban by using VPNs. Additionally, the ban does not apply to Chinese nationals who reside outside of China.

The year 2022 is destined to be remembered as one of the most challenging periods for the crypto industry. It witnessed a substantial decline, with Bitcoin, in particular, experiencing a loss exceeding 60% of its value. Additionally, the overall market incurred losses of just over $2 trillion during the year. Furthermore, this tumultuous period saw the downfall of several crypto firms. However, FTX was the most disruptive of them all. As Sam Bankman-Fried, the figure behind FTX, faces a jury that will determine his future, there are signs that confidence in the crypto market is gradually being reestablished.
In addition to these developments, Bitcoin [BTC] was observed making strides toward a path of resurgence. At press time, BTC was trading at $27,587.30, approaching the $28,000 mark.

A recent survey conducted by Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, and published on Oct. 5, 2023, provides valuable insights into how digital assets are now instrumental in elevating living standards. These assets have been accomplishing various financial objectives for users around the world.
About half of crypto users, or around 50%, are directing their investments with the aim of enhancing their everyday living conditions. The survey’s findings indicate that in countries such as South Korea, Canada, and Turkey, 46%, 44%, and 41% of respondents, respectively, have identified this as their foremost financial goal when engaging in digital asset investments.
Moreover, the survey reveals that approximately 36% of participants from Malaysia and Taiwan place a higher priority on improving their family’s overall quality of life. This was when compared to other financial aspirations.
The extensive survey collected information during the period spanning from May to August. It included participation from more than 1,500 individuals representing 20 countries across Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, the United States, and Canada. 
Notably, the survey also illuminated diverse motivations among female crypto investors in different nations. For instance, in the United States and Turkey, around 27% of female crypto investors have their investment in crypto. It is mostly driven by the desire to finance their children’s education. In contrast, this particular goal was less prevalent in South Korea and Japan. Only 5% of female investors expressed the same aspiration.

In terms of Chinese involvement, the survey provided insights into the extent of engagement among crypto users in China. Despite the prohibition on crypto trading within the country, the survey findings suggest that Chinese citizens are actively in the crypto market.
A significant 18% of survey respondents from China stated that they had invested amounts ranging from $50,000 to $100,000. Amidst this, an additional 19% had committed investments between $100,000 and $500,000. It’s worth noting that Chinese nationals can still possess cryptocurrencies and navigate around the trading ban by using VPNs. Additionally, the ban does not apply to Chinese nationals who reside outside of China.

The year 2022 is destined to be remembered as one of the most challenging periods for the crypto industry. It witnessed a substantial decline, with Bitcoin, in particular, experiencing a loss exceeding 60% of its value. Additionally, the overall market incurred losses of just over $2 trillion during the year. Furthermore, this tumultuous period saw the downfall of several crypto firms. However, FTX was the most disruptive of them all. As Sam Bankman-Fried, the figure behind FTX, faces a jury that will determine his future, there are signs that confidence in the crypto market is gradually being reestablished.
In addition to these developments, Bitcoin [BTC] was observed making strides toward a path of resurgence. At press time, BTC was trading at $27,587.30, approaching the $28,000 mark.

Is JPEX Facing the Same Catastrophe as FTX Exchange? Here’s What Happening;"The post Is JPEX Facing the Same Catastrophe as FTX Exchange? Here’s What Happening appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
In recent events, the JPEX virtual asset trading platform(VATPs)in Hong Kong has come under scrutiny for its suspected involvement in a major fraud case. This development has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the current regulatory framework governing cryptocurrencies. Xu Zhengyu, a prominent financial commentator, has emphasized the urgent need for more robust oversight in the industry. This article delves into the JPEX scandal and the pressing demand for a comprehensive regulatory system for cryptocurrencies.
Hui Ching-yu, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury expressed his concerns during an investment committee interview program. He underscored that the JPEX scandal highlights the pressing need for regulatory supervision in the virtual asset sector. Furthermore, he pointed out a significant regulatory gap in Hong Kong — the absence of a stablecoin framework.
Xu Zhengyu, speaking in a live online program of the Investment and Financial Education Committee, shed light on the high risks associated with unregulated virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms often lack transparency and may operate without stability or reliability. In the event of disputes or platform failures, investors have limited avenues for recourse, potentially resulting in substantial financial losses. Notable incidents, like FTX’s collapse overseas and the recent JPEX case in Hong Kong, serve as stark reminders of these risks.
Many virtual asset trading platforms have historically relied on stablecoins like USDT as trading mediums. Xu Zhengyu emphasized the necessity for these coins to maintain value stability by being backed by US dollars or gold. However, past instances have demonstrated that stablecoins can experience significant price volatility or collapse. Xu stressed that the management of reserves by stablecoin issuers directly impacts price stability and investors’ ability to redeem fiat currencies. Given these challenges, Hong Kong has refrained from permitting retail trading in stablecoins until comprehensive regulations are in place.
To safeguard investor interests and prevent conflicts of interest, Huang Lexin, Director of the Licensing Section and Head of the Financial Technology Group of the Intermediary Department of the SFC, outlined certain restrictions for licensed virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms are prohibited from offering various investment products, including periodic “pledges,” interest collection services, deposits, and derivatives transactions.
Huang Lexin also noted that SFC-licensed virtual asset trading platforms are limited to facilitating the purchase and sale of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for retail investors. Any introduction of new currencies on these platforms must adhere to stringent reporting requirements and obtain approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission before becoming available for trading.

Bitcoin and altcoins pushing higher;"Friday has dawned brightly for the crypto sector and a push to the upside is taking place.
If stock markets fall, then this is certainly transferred to the crypto market, and being high risk assets, they are likely to fall hard. However, there are still fluctuations in markets, and they go up as well as down.
After five days of sideways action Bitcoin is rising once again.
Bitcoin found support towards the end of September at the $26,000 level and has been steadily trending upwards ever since. At time of going to press bitcoin is once more at the $27,600 resistance level, and finally taking this out and flipping it into support would be an important step in bitcoin’s climb higher.
Of course, there is still the thorny issue of the 200-week moving average just above, which previously stopped bitcoin in its tracks at $28,000. However, the trend is still up, and if bitcoin keeps knocking at this level it is likely to break through eventually.
If the Alpha beast of the crypto jungle rises then the altcoins will normally follow. Ethereum is having a strong day so far, and is currently butting up against resistance at $1,630. However, it does appear to be breaking the downwards trend from October 1, so look to $ETH to perhaps also break resistance.
Solana is having an even better day thus far. 3% up currently, $SOL is heading back to $24 at a fast rate of knots. The Solana community has its Breakpoint 2023 Conference coming up at the end of the month, and this perhaps why $SOL is moving strongly up again.
A bullish flag has been forming since the beginning of October, and $SOL looks to be breaking out. A measured move for the breakout would take the $SOL price to $29, flipping the resistance at $26 into support. 
Render ($RNDR) is another altcoin riding high. Up 1.75% on the day, $RNDR is battling resistance at $1.75. Should it overcome this, the next resistance at $1.80 awaits, with the 200-week moving average just above.
Render’s founder, Jules Urbach, is speaking at the Solana Breakpoint Conference. What he has to say is likely to be very interesting, although a ‘sell-the-news’ reaction on the $RNDR price may also be likely.

BCH Price Analysis: Will This Pattern Push BCH TO $300?;"The post BCH Price Analysis: Will This Pattern Push BCH TO $300? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
As the overall market recovers, with Bitcoin taking a bullish step in October, the altcoins are on a positive track. Even though the BCH price breached the $250 mark in the first two days of October with a remarkable growth of 10%. 
Despite this, the overhead supply pressure at the psychological level caused a sharp correction in the Bitcoin Cash market price. However, with the sentiment turning bullish, expectations for the Bitcoin Cash price prediction in 2023 remain optimistic.
Although there has been a recent correction, the overall trend of the BCH price suggests a bullish revival and a rise to higher levels. The bullish reversal from the buyers’ region at $180 and the 200-day EMA provided the Bitcoin Cash price with a springboard to regain momentum.
Moreover, the recent sharp correction to the $230 mark increases the chances of an inverted head and shoulder. Currently, the altcoin price trades at $231.50, with multiple Doji candle formations at the $230 support level.
With the underlying bullish sentiments averting downfall, the chances of BCH price taking a reversal to $250 are increasing. This recovery phase will complete the bullish pattern with the neckline at $250.
Technical indicators:
Coming to the technical indicators, the Directional Movement Index sustains a bullish point of view. 
DMI indicator: The ADX line (black line) has shot up in recent times, indicating a strong momentum. Additionally, the DI line remains bullish, signaling further recovery.
EMA: The 50 and 200-day EMA maintain a positive alignment and continue to rise higher, which certifies the uptrend in motion. 
With plans for a bullish reversal from $230, the inverted head and shoulder pattern presents a trend reversal opportunity in BCH price. However, if the price struggles to overcome the $250 mark, it may lead to a potential pullback to $228. 
However, the inverted head and shoulder breakout will increase the likelihood of Bitcoin Cash price exceeding $300. With the potential to continue the rally above, the reversal from $250 or the $250 breakout will prove a crucial entry point for sideline buyers. 
Considering the price breaks below the $228 post, the downtrend will plunge the prices to $200.

Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the 2023 ;"The post Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the 2023  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
After the crypto market euphoria of 2021, prices have cooled considerably in 2022 and early 2023. Bitcoin, Ethereum and most major cryptocurrencies are down 60-80% from their all-time highs. This bear market provides the perfect chance to accumulate top cryptocurrencies at discounted prices before the next major bull market.
Just as the stock market moves through periods of boom and bust, so too does the nascent cryptocurrency market follow predictable cycles. We have already witnessed this pattern with a bull run in 2017 giving way to a multi-year bear trend, before the huge surge in 2020-21. Now, as crypto winter sets in, savvy investors know that the best time to buy is when there is “blood in the streets.”
History has shown patience pays off handsomely for those accumulating top-tier crypto assets when prices are depressed. When the next wave of institutional and retail adoption comes, supply squeezes for scarce assets like Bitcoin will drive prices higher. Leading smart contract platforms like Ethereum will also benefit from further mainstream utilization in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, metaverse and Web3 applications.
This article highlights 5 of the most promising cryptocurrencies to add to your portfolio during the 2023 bear market. With fundamental development continuing apace despite price declines, our recommended crypto assets are prime to generate tremendous upside for investors with long time horizons. Periods of fear and uncertainty often provide the greatest opportunities – the forward-thinking will stake their claims now and reap substantial rewards during the next bull cycle.
Crypton‘s association with the Utopia P2P ecosystem makes it uniquely positioned for long-term success. Utopia is a decentralized network built for private, secure communication and data transmission. All financial transactions within the ecosystem are conducted using Crypton.
As a privacy coin, Crypton offers complete anonymity and untraceability for transactions. This is accomplished through cryptographic signing and encryption to protect against fraud and ensure the security of funds. For cryptocurrency investors and users concerned about privacy, Crypton checks all the right boxes.
The instant, irreversible settlement of Crypton transactions also makes it attractive as a payment method. Merchants and vendors can benefit from fast transaction times without the risk of reversal. These are advantages Crypton has over traditional fiat currency payment rails.
Crypton can also be earned through mining to support the Utopia network infrastructure. This promotes greater decentralization and alignment of incentives. Miners earn newly minted Crypton as well as interest on their balances, providing recurring yield.
Importantly, Crypton has a real-world use case powering the Utopia ecosystem. It is not just an abstract investment asset. Adoption of Utopia for private communication and transactions will drive Demand for Crypton over time.
For cryptocurrency investors interested in privacy, security, speed, and an associated ecosystem, Crypton checks all the boxes. As Utopia continues growing, it represents an asymmetric opportunity compared to other crypto assets. For these reasons, Crypton is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to invest in for the long-term.
AQLA is designed to capitalize on the massive and rapidly growing carbon offset market, estimated to reach $250 billion by Morgan Stanley. With global carbon emissions continuing to rise, the need for carbon offsets and mitigation projects will only increase in the coming years.
AQLA aims to bring credibility and transparency to carbon offsets by recording them on its blockchain platform. This provides tamper-proof verification of the offsets and allows them to be tokenized and traded efficiently. The blockchain approach solves key issues like double-counting and verification that have hindered the offset market’s growth.
The project has a global vision of promoting awareness and enabling businesses to adopt carbon neutral practices. As climate change concerns grow, this first-mover advantage in the blockchain carbon space gives AQLA huge room for adoption. Its standards and methodologies align with major international climate agreements as well.
Additionally, AQLA is actively developing real-world use cases in voluntary carbon markets to back green technologies. This creates utility and demand for the AQLA token beyond just speculation. The wider applicability in ESG solutions also expands its total addressable market.
With environmental sustainability becoming increasingly important worldwide, AQLA is a purpose-built solution catering to massive needs. Its blockchain platform and token allow climate action to scale exponentially. For investors, getting in early with AQLA provides exposure to a rapidly expanding space. The project’s sustainability focus also gives it an ethical edge over other crypto offerings.
XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, an open-source, decentralized blockchain created by Ripple Labs. It is designed to facilitate fast, affordable global financial transactions.
A key advantage of XRP is its speed – transactions settle in 3-5 seconds. This makes it well-suited for cross-border payments and currency exchanges where slow processing times currently cause delays and high costs. Financial institutions can save significant time and money by using XRP.
Additionally, XRP has very low transaction fees at a fraction of a penny per transaction. This scalable cost structure allows XRP to handle high transaction volumes without becoming prohibitively expensive.
Ripple is aggressively pushing adoption of XRP by partnering with major financial institutions and money transfer services globally. These partnerships are critical for giving XRP real-world utility and payment volume to drive demand.
Developments like Ripple’s acquisition of a money transfer service and XRP’s increasing use for cheaper remittances in emerging markets demonstrate this adoption. As more entities utilize XRP for liquidity and payments, its status as a leading digital asset will solidify.
With a large circulating supply, XRP can handle massive transaction volumes without illiquidity. The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and XRP is well positioned to emerge as an enterprise-grade asset especially for financial transactions. For investors, getting onboard this growing use case early could provide substantial long-term upside.
Dogecoin stands out from other cryptocurrencies because of its branding and approachability as the original “fun and friendly” internet money. The Doge meme makes it more accessible to the mainstream public versus other cryptos with obscure names or technical focus.
This friendliness has translated to fast adoption and community growth, with Dogecoin boasting over 4 million followers across social media. The large passionate community gives Dogecoin strength and viral potential that many coins lack.
A major recent development was Elon Musk’s endorsement of Dogecoin and self-proclaimed status as the “Dogefather.” Musk has an unparalleled influence in the crypto space and frequently promotes Dogecoin to his millions of followers. This high-profile celebrity backing sets Dogecoin apart.
Unlike Bitcoin which has a hard cap of 21 million coins, Dogecoin’s supply increases 5 billion coins per year. This makes it better suited as a transactional currency because more supply prevents deflationary spirals as demand rises. The inflationary dynamic encourages spending versus just HODLing the coin.
For investors, Dogecoin offers asymmetric upside because of its extremely low price compared to other major cryptos. Despite its beginnings as a joke, Dogecoin’s brand appeal, passionate community, influential backers, and transactional use case give it a unique advantage that should not be underestimated going forward.
BAD IDEA combines three highly promising technologies – AI, blockchain, and DAOs – into one ambitious experiment. It is unique in letting decentralized AI agents participate equally in governance and decision-making. If successful, this could pioneer a new model for blockchain projects.
Allowing AI agents to have voting rights and manage treasury funds autonomously is innovative. The agents can dynamically adjust the tokenomics and monetary policy based on data versus being locked into a rigid set of rules. This gives BAD IDEA the flexibility to optimize sustainability.
The project produces thought-provoking content on integrating AI into blockchain and Web3. This demonstrates real-world applications versus being just a speculative asset. BAD IDEA aims to address complex issues like climate change through decentralized collaboration.
Although named tongue-in-cheek, BAD IDEA is seriously researching the possibilities of AI-powered governance. The token distribution allocates funds for different development branches to incentivize continuous innovation.
With AI playing an increasing role across industries, BAD IDEA is getting ahead of the curve by researching how to harmonize AI with human governance. The project welcomes community feedback and participation, creating a collaborative environment.
For investors, BAD IDEA offers exposure to a potentially game-changing decentralized governance model. The project’s growth is connected directly to real R&D versus hype, giving it fundamental substance.
The cryptocurrency market is always evolving with new innovative projects and economic cycles. While prices have declined in 2022 from the highs, this bear period provides the perfect chance to research and invest in projects with strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential. The five cryptocurrencies discussed in this article – Crypton, AQLA, XRP, Dogecoin, and BAD IDEA Token – are leaders in their respective categories and have major developments on the horizon.
Whether it is the privacy and security of Crypton fueling Utopia, the carbon offset potential of AQLA, the speed and scalability of XRP for payments, the mainstream brand appeal of Dogecoin, or the cutting-edge governance experiment of the BAD IDEA Token – each cryptocurrency offers investors an intriguing asymmetric opportunity. The markets may be driven by fear and uncertainty now, but the future remains bright for blockchain technology. Maintaining a long-term horizon and accumulating promising crypto assets during bear markets has proven to be a winning strategy throughout the history of this nascent asset class.

When the next wave of institutional and retail adoption comes, supply squeezes for scarce assets like Bitcoin will drive prices higher. Leading smart contract platforms like Ethereum will also benefit from further mainstream utilization in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, metaverse and Web3 applications.
This article highlights 5 of the most promising cryptocurrencies to add to your portfolio during the 2023 bear market. With fundamental development continuing apace despite price declines, our recommended crypto assets are prime to generate tremendous upside for investors with long time horizons. Periods of fear and uncertainty often provide the greatest opportunities – the forward-thinking will stake their claims now and reap substantial rewards during the next bull cycle.
Crypton‘s association with the Utopia P2P ecosystem makes it uniquely positioned for long-term success. Utopia is a decentralized network built for private, secure communication and data transmission. All financial transactions within the ecosystem are conducted using Crypton.
As a privacy coin, Crypton offers complete anonymity and untraceability for transactions. This is accomplished through cryptographic signing and encryption to protect against fraud and ensure the security of funds. For cryptocurrency investors and users concerned about privacy, Crypton checks all the right boxes.
The instant, irreversible settlement of Crypton transactions also makes it attractive as a payment method. Merchants and vendors can benefit from fast transaction times without the risk of reversal. These are advantages Crypton has over traditional fiat currency payment rails.
Crypton can also be earned through mining to support the Utopia network infrastructure. This promotes greater decentralization and alignment of incentives. Miners earn newly minted Crypton as well as interest on their balances, providing recurring yield.
Importantly, Crypton has a real-world use case powering the Utopia ecosystem. It is not just an abstract investment asset. Adoption of Utopia for private communication and transactions will drive Demand for Crypton over time.
For cryptocurrency investors interested in privacy, security, speed, and an associated ecosystem, Crypton checks all the boxes. As Utopia continues growing, it represents an asymmetric opportunity compared to other crypto assets. For these reasons, Crypton is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to invest in for the long-term.
AQLA is designed to capitalize on the massive and rapidly growing carbon offset market, estimated to reach $250 billion by Morgan Stanley. With global carbon emissions continuing to rise, the need for carbon offsets and mitigation projects will only increase in the coming years.
AQLA aims to bring credibility and transparency to carbon offsets by recording them on its blockchain platform. This provides tamper-proof verification of the offsets and allows them to be tokenized and traded efficiently. The blockchain approach solves key issues like double-counting and verification that have hindered the offset market’s growth.
The project has a global vision of promoting awareness and enabling businesses to adopt carbon neutral practices. As climate change concerns grow, this first-mover advantage in the blockchain carbon space gives AQLA huge room for adoption. Its standards and methodologies align with major international climate agreements as well.
Additionally, AQLA is actively developing real-world use cases in voluntary carbon markets to back green technologies. This creates utility and demand for the AQLA token beyond just speculation. The wider applicability in ESG solutions also expands its total addressable market.
With environmental sustainability becoming increasingly important worldwide, AQLA is a purpose-built solution catering to massive needs. Its blockchain platform and token allow climate action to scale exponentially. For investors, getting in early with AQLA provides exposure to a rapidly expanding space. The project’s sustainability focus also gives it an ethical edge over other crypto offerings.
XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, an open-source, decentralized blockchain created by Ripple Labs. It is designed to facilitate fast, affordable global financial transactions.
A key advantage of XRP is its speed – transactions settle in 3-5 seconds. This makes it well-suited for cross-border payments and currency exchanges where slow processing times currently cause delays and high costs. Financial institutions can save significant time and money by using XRP.
Additionally, XRP has very low transaction fees at a fraction of a penny per transaction. This scalable cost structure allows XRP to handle high transaction volumes without becoming prohibitively expensive.
Ripple is aggressively pushing adoption of XRP by partnering with major financial institutions and money transfer services globally. These partnerships are critical for giving XRP real-world utility and payment volume to drive demand.
Developments like Ripple’s acquisition of a money transfer service and XRP’s increasing use for cheaper remittances in emerging markets demonstrate this adoption. As more entities utilize XRP for liquidity and payments, its status as a leading digital asset will solidify.
With a large circulating supply, XRP can handle massive transaction volumes without illiquidity. The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and XRP is well positioned to emerge as an enterprise-grade asset especially for financial transactions. For investors, getting onboard this growing use case early could provide substantial long-term upside.
Dogecoin stands out from other cryptocurrencies because of its branding and approachability as the original “fun and friendly” internet money. The Doge meme makes it more accessible to the mainstream public versus other cryptos with obscure names or technical focus.
This friendliness has translated to fast adoption and community growth, with Dogecoin boasting over 4 million followers across social media. The large passionate community gives Dogecoin strength and viral potential that many coins lack.
A major recent development was Elon Musk’s endorsement of Dogecoin and self-proclaimed status as the “Dogefather.” Musk has an unparalleled influence in the crypto space and frequently promotes Dogecoin to his millions of followers. This high-profile celebrity backing sets Dogecoin apart.
Unlike Bitcoin which has a hard cap of 21 million coins, Dogecoin’s supply increases 5 billion coins per year. This makes it better suited as a transactional currency because more supply prevents deflationary spirals as demand rises. The inflationary dynamic encourages spending versus just HODLing the coin.
For investors, Dogecoin offers asymmetric upside because of its extremely low price compared to other major cryptos. Despite its beginnings as a joke, Dogecoin’s brand appeal, passionate community, influential backers, and transactional use case give it a unique advantage that should not be underestimated going forward.
BAD IDEA combines three highly promising technologies – AI, blockchain, and DAOs – into one ambitious experiment. It is unique in letting decentralized AI agents participate equally in governance and decision-making. If successful, this could pioneer a new model for blockchain projects.
Allowing AI agents to have voting rights and manage treasury funds autonomously is innovative. The agents can dynamically adjust the tokenomics and monetary policy based on data versus being locked into a rigid set of rules. This gives BAD IDEA the flexibility to optimize sustainability.
The project produces thought-provoking content on integrating AI into blockchain and Web3. This demonstrates real-world applications versus being just a speculative asset. BAD IDEA aims to address complex issues like climate change through decentralized collaboration.
Although named tongue-in-cheek, BAD IDEA is seriously researching the possibilities of AI-powered governance. The token distribution allocates funds for different development branches to incentivize continuous innovation.
With AI playing an increasing role across industries, BAD IDEA is getting ahead of the curve by researching how to harmonize AI with human governance. The project welcomes community feedback and participation, creating a collaborative environment.
For investors, BAD IDEA offers exposure to a potentially game-changing decentralized governance model. The project’s growth is connected directly to real R&D versus hype, giving it fundamental substance.
The cryptocurrency market is always evolving with new innovative projects and economic cycles. While prices have declined in 2022 from the highs, this bear period provides the perfect chance to research and invest in projects with strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential. The five cryptocurrencies discussed in this article – Crypton, AQLA, XRP, Dogecoin, and BAD IDEA Token – are leaders in their respective categories and have major developments on the horizon.
Whether it is the privacy and security of Crypton fueling Utopia, the carbon offset potential of AQLA, the speed and scalability of XRP for payments, the mainstream brand appeal of Dogecoin, or the cutting-edge governance experiment of the BAD IDEA Token – each cryptocurrency offers investors an intriguing asymmetric opportunity. The markets may be driven by fear and uncertainty now, but the future remains bright for blockchain technology. Maintaining a long-term horizon and accumulating promising crypto assets during bear markets has proven to be a winning strategy throughout the history of this nascent asset class.

ThorChain Hits Record-Setting $355 Million Trading Volume in a Day;"ThorChain, a decentralized liquidity protocol, reported a record-breaking transaction volume on Oct. 5, with the number surging to $355 million in a single day, marking an all-time high.
This noteworthy event is part of a larger trend as the cumulative transaction volume over the past five days has surpassed the $1 billion mark.
According to the analysis, the surge in transaction volume coincided with the rise in swap counts associated with the network. On Oct. 5, when the transaction volume was close to $355 million, the count of swaps related to the network was 115,630.
This was an upward surge compared to the preceding day, when the swap count was 61,877, and the total volume was merely $170.8 million.
The daily change in transaction volume from Oct. 4 to Oct. 5 was a massive 107.6% increase.
A look at the charts indicates an upward trajectory in the transaction volumes since Sept. 29. While the network reported just about $34.45 million as total volume on Sept. 29, the value increased to $60.14 million the next day and $166.4 by Oct. 1.
Later, on Oct. 2, the total transaction volume made a new high of $197.33 million before minor plunges were noted at $173.84 million and $170.84 million between Oct. 3 and 4, respectively. Between Oct. 1 and 5, the cumulative transaction volume was $1.063 billion.
As the transaction volumes seemingly surged, so did the earnings volume associated with the network. On Oct. 4, the liquidity earning was about $109K, and the bond earning stood at $66.7K, a major decline from the highs recorded on Oct. 2. However, on Oct. 5, the liquidity and bond earnings stood at $164.35K and $101.96K, respectively.
As per analysts, the sudden volume surge can be linked to increased hacking activities recently, especially with cross-chain BTC transactions being the main contributor to the massive volume surge.
To address these adverse events, reports indicate that ThorSwap, a product of ThorChain, has paused the platform, shifting into maintenance mode.
When speaking of the developments, ThorSwap developer tweeted;
“Yesterday, following a careful evaluation of the situation and consultation with advisors, legal counsel, and law enforcement, the decision was made to temporarily transition the THORSwap interface into maintenance mode. This action was taken to swiftly curtail any further potential illicit activity.”
Fellow THORChads,
A pressing and persistent concern has recently come to light: the potential movement of illicit funds through THORChain and, specifically, THORSwap. Such activities have no place on the THORSwap platform, and THORSwap stands firmly against any and all criminal…
— THORSwap  #BetterThanCEX (@THORSwap) October 6, 2023

The tweet noted that ThorSwap will remain in this mode till the developers find a more permanent solution to implement and bolster the platform’s continued security and integrity.
The native token of the ThorChain network, Rune, has been trading in the red for most of the past 24 hours. Starting the day at 2.048, the token surged to $2.1 before plunging to a low of about $1.93. Reports indicate that the token has lost about 2,51% in value in the 24 hours from October 5 till the reporting time.
However, the story is quite different in the past seven days, with Rune trading in the green. Starting at $1.92 on Sept. 29, Rune surged to a high of $2.23 on Oct. 2 before falling to a low of $1.88 on Oct. 4.
The charts suggest that the assets have mainly shown a sideways price action, especially in the past five days. However, in the past week, Rune has gained about 3.02% in value.

‘Trading Through Gamification Can Represent the Future’ Says Banksters’ Alexandru Carbunariu;"While centralized exchanges (cexs) are instrumental in helping new users grasp all things crypto, they nevertheless do not go “the extra mile in educating their audience properly,” Alexandru Carbunariu, the CMO at the edutech simulator Banksters, has asserted. According to Carbunariu, a Web3 advisor, properly educating newbies includes making the experience more interactive and fun. He added that Web3 platforms should take a leaf out of their Web2 counterparts’ playbook.
Expanding on the argument that education should be more fun, the CMO said he concurred with those who believe gamification to be the right way of encouraging more positive trading behavior. However, Carbunariu told Bitcoin.com News that while “trading through gamification may represent the future,” many of the current Web3 games may “have taken a wrong turn.”
When asked for his thoughts on the so-called trade-to-win strategy, the Banksters CMO insisted that such a model is better than play-to-earn (P2E) models because it engenders confidence. He suggested that such a model can be ideal for newcomers. Meanwhile, in written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, Carbunariu also articulated why competition is necessary for Web3 platforms looking to get communities attached to their respective products.
Below are Alexandru Carbunariu‘s responses to all questions sent.
Bitcoin.com News (BCN): Centralized exchanges (cexs) are one of the gateways to all things crypto for new users and most of them have taken on the job of educating newcomers. In your opinion, what can they do better or differently to bring in more Web2 users via education?
Alexandru Carbunariu (AC): Speaking from experience, centralized exchanges don’t take the extra mile in educating their audience properly. A lot more things should be done in terms of education, to make it more fun, more rewarding as well as more interactive. We should check what Web2 asset platforms do and get inspired by their work. We rarely see that in Web3. However, we believe that with new regulations, specific training models will come up.
What needs to be done in order to attract Web2 users:
Create interactive training that will provide incentives (like we have seen Revolut doing).
Use normal KOLs [key opinion leaders] to present their products in a transparent [way] but also using normal non-technical language.
Try to introduce academy programs, where normal users can attend, therefore the knowledge will be much higher. Provide transparency when involving risks. Introduce alerts when the user is lost in the complex UX / UI of the platform.
BCN: Do you believe gamification is the right approach to encouraging positive crypto trading behavior with long-term benefits?
AC: Of course. Creating a more fun environment can be relaxing for the user, and if you don’t mix that with financial loss, it’s actually perfect. We are one of the first to build this type of concept. Our A/B tests, focus groups as well user validation were high, meaning that we were on the right track.
I believe that the Web3 games have taken a wrong turn, and the project owners have lost focus. Web3 should be the gateway to the future and it should provide new ways, apart from the traditional ones, in order to onboard as many users.
Trading through gamification can represent the future. First users need to understand it, then they will trade or invest with caution. If their first experience provides them with losses, then they are unlikely to come back. This is why Banksters has stepped in and is helping them to understand more about crypto, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and trading.

BCN: Can you describe what the trade-to-win model is all about and how this differs from play-to-earn?
AC: In the past 2-3 years we have seen the “P2E” as well as the “P&E” types. One thing they have in common is the fact that they have not identified a balance that will give them a much-needed token stability.
Our Trade2Win model lets the user:
First test the product
Learn about the product
Play around with it
And become a winner
This is the model that provides more confidence, and the rewards will come only at the end, meaning if you are a winner then the rewards will be won. This is a more or less “shadow” plan from the trading world, where you need to practice, learn, trade and then gain profits.
BCN: Trading is an umbrella term that encompasses various strategies based on an individual’s mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors. How does your platform help users figure out an optimal strategy for them through low-risk education?
AC: This is a very good question. To give a more of a straight answer: Yes and No. Basically, we can cover this through our so-called “Abilities” which can be compared with “Superpowers” a hero avatar has in the Web2 games. Abilities actually “copy” what is happening on the real market. There are abilities like:
Elon Musk Tweet
Vitalik’s Support
CZ’s Effect
Market Squeeze
Pump and Dump
Hype
Insider Trade
These are real-life trading events, and in many cases, traders or users don’t understand them. What Banksters did was to analyze all of the historical pricing for these events, develop a price algorithm then infuse them into these Abilities.
Now the user will understand what happens to their portfolio and how it will react when these Abilities are used. This actually provides no risk for the user as well as covers a new mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors.
BCN: Whether it’s crypto trading or something else, competition is often an integral part of that. How is Banksters encouraging competition among users?
AC: They are highly competitive! We often have tournaments and live streams which reward users with real USDT. It drives them to use the product and makes them happy with both the game but also the environment.
We strongly believe that competitions, challenges, tournaments and livestreams definitely help the community being attached to the product, while the team can gather transparent and vital feedback.
BCN: When discussing factors holding back large-scale adoption of crypto, lack of education and intuitive user interface (UI) often get the most attention. However, could it be that we have not had mass adoption because the crypto ecosystem is still struggling to find the product-market fit?
AC: Another good question. The answer is pretty simple. It’s about money. However, it’s more than that. For example:
Users:
A lot of people have lost their hard-earned money during the bear market while listening to the unprepared and uneducated key opinion leaders (KOLs) who often accept to promote projects with no filters.
Project Owners:
If one puts two years and $10,000 in the right way, they could raise between $500,000 and a million dollars while having absolutely no experience in blockchain tech, development, management, marketing, or product growth. This, however, has changed and now a lot of Web2 specialists are entering the Web3 space and I believe the standard will go just higher.
Centralized Exchanges:
Providing crazy leverages, with no education, with no warning, and to top all that with FTX keeping their crypto wallet keys in a Google form.
At the end of the day, human nature had to kick in, meaning something terrible had to happen in order for something to be changed.
I think Web3 has gone through a reset in the past 2-3 years, and now, finally, we can see some highly professional projects with funding resources delivering innovative products. Such projects have higher odds of finding product-market fit and accelerating adoption.

Bitcoin And Crypto Under The Lens As Bond Market Recalls 2008 Crash;"As the global financial landscape witnesses a seismic shift, reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble burst, alarm bells are ringing in the bond market, alerting the Bitcoin and crypto market as well.
Renowned Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Genevieve Roch-Decter, highlighted the striking parallels in a recent tweet, stating, “I can’t believe I am saying this but the slump in 10-year and 30-year bonds is approaching the epic drops we saw in stocks during the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble bust.”
Bloomberg Surveillance’s Lisa Abramowicz reinforces this grim narrative, pointing out that “bonds maturing in 10 years or more have slumped 46% since peaking in March 2020, just shy of the 49% plunge in US stocks in the aftermath of the dot-com bust. The route in 30-year bonds has been even worse, tumbling 53%.”
Onramp, a Bitcoin asset management platform, adds further context by emphasizing the historic nature of the trend. This decline, particularly in bonds with maturities exceeding a decade, harkens back to market downturns like the dot-com bubble collapse. The Federal Reserve’s resolute stance on inflation and a fragile fiscal environment have disrupted the traditional appeal of long-maturity debt, raising questions about the possibility of a debt spiral.
The situation is further complicated by the behavior of the yield curve. Historically, an inverted yield curve has foreshadowed recessions. However, the recent correction has seen a rare “bear steepener,” marked by rising long-term yields. This phenomenon, seen in the past before recessions, raises concerns of an impending economic downturn.
“While some question the yield curve’s reliability as a recession indicator, the current bear steepening suggests that an economic downturn could be imminent. This is particularly concerning given the Fed’s ongoing commitment to restrictive monetary policy, making the situation ripe for potential market volatility and economic uncertainty, “ Dylan LeClair from Onramp notes.
Meanwhile, Barclays’ analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha suggests that only a stock market crash could halt the bond market’s decline. Unlike previous cycles, traditional bond backstops are dwindling, with the Fed shifting from a net buyer to a net seller, and foreign institutional buying slowing.
This highlights the stark disconnect between equity valuations and long-end bond rates, with stocks having significant room for devaluation before bonds stabilize. And if stocks crash, Bitcoin and crypto could be just as affected.
The turmoil in the bond market has far-reaching implications, including its impact on Bitcoin and crypto. Remarkably, the crypto market has never experienced such a situation, but there are general observations of how risk assets have reacted in such environments in the past.
First, rising treasury yields make risk-free returns more attractive, potentially prompting some investors to reallocate capital from risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto to treasury bills. This shift could decrease demand, putting downward pressure on their prices.
Moreover, a sharp rise in 10-year Treasury yields can signal a tighter monetary policy, weighing on risk assets. Higher yields also mean higher borrowing costs, which can impact crypto. When interest rates rise, non-interest-bearing assets like Bitcoin may seem less attractive compared to yield-bearing assets.
A significant increase in Treasury yields can also lead to reduced liquidity in other financial markets, such as the Bitcoin and crypto space. Institutional investors facing liquidity constraints may liquidate more liquid assets like BTC and altcoins causing potential price declines.
Lastly, sharp yield increases can create volatility across various asset classes as investors seek to reduce risk or cover losses elsewhere. Bitcoin and crypto are highly influenced by market sentiment and speculative behavior. The market’s interpretation of rising yields can sway investor behavior, impacting crypto prices.
Accordingly, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, recently predicted:

As the global financial landscape witnesses a seismic shift, reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble burst, alarm bells are ringing in the bond market, alerting the Bitcoin and crypto market as well.
Renowned Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Genevieve Roch-Decter, highlighted the striking parallels in a recent tweet, stating, “I can’t believe I am saying this but the slump in 10-year and 30-year bonds is approaching the epic drops we saw in stocks during the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble bust.”
Bloomberg Surveillance’s Lisa Abramowicz reinforces this grim narrative, pointing out that “bonds maturing in 10 years or more have slumped 46% since peaking in March 2020, just shy of the 49% plunge in US stocks in the aftermath of the dot-com bust. The route in 30-year bonds has been even worse, tumbling 53%.”
Onramp, a Bitcoin asset management platform, adds further context by emphasizing the historic nature of the trend. This decline, particularly in bonds with maturities exceeding a decade, harkens back to market downturns like the dot-com bubble collapse. The Federal Reserve’s resolute stance on inflation and a fragile fiscal environment have disrupted the traditional appeal of long-maturity debt, raising questions about the possibility of a debt spiral.
The situation is further complicated by the behavior of the yield curve. Historically, an inverted yield curve has foreshadowed recessions. However, the recent correction has seen a rare “bear steepener,” marked by rising long-term yields. This phenomenon, seen in the past before recessions, raises concerns of an impending economic downturn.
“While some question the yield curve’s reliability as a recession indicator, the current bear steepening suggests that an economic downturn could be imminent. This is particularly concerning given the Fed’s ongoing commitment to restrictive monetary policy, making the situation ripe for potential market volatility and economic uncertainty, “ Dylan LeClair from Onramp notes.
Meanwhile, Barclays’ analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha suggests that only a stock market crash could halt the bond market’s decline. Unlike previous cycles, traditional bond backstops are dwindling, with the Fed shifting from a net buyer to a net seller, and foreign institutional buying slowing.
This highlights the stark disconnect between equity valuations and long-end bond rates, with stocks having significant room for devaluation before bonds stabilize. And if stocks crash, Bitcoin and crypto could be just as affected.
The turmoil in the bond market has far-reaching implications, including its impact on Bitcoin and crypto. Remarkably, the crypto market has never experienced such a situation, but there are general observations of how risk assets have reacted in such environments in the past.
First, rising treasury yields make risk-free returns more attractive, potentially prompting some investors to reallocate capital from risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto to treasury bills. This shift could decrease demand, putting downward pressure on their prices.
Moreover, a sharp rise in 10-year Treasury yields can signal a tighter monetary policy, weighing on risk assets. Higher yields also mean higher borrowing costs, which can impact crypto. When interest rates rise, non-interest-bearing assets like Bitcoin may seem less attractive compared to yield-bearing assets.
A significant increase in Treasury yields can also lead to reduced liquidity in other financial markets, such as the Bitcoin and crypto space. Institutional investors facing liquidity constraints may liquidate more liquid assets like BTC and altcoins causing potential price declines.
Lastly, sharp yield increases can create volatility across various asset classes as investors seek to reduce risk or cover losses elsewhere. Bitcoin and crypto are highly influenced by market sentiment and speculative behavior. The market’s interpretation of rising yields can sway investor behavior, impacting crypto prices.
Accordingly, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, recently predicted:
The 10YR is up another 10% since! […] The Fed wants more unemployment. The job market is still too strong. They’ve raised the expected 2024 rates as a result and the 10YR has broken out to new decade highs. As long as the 10YR is breaking upwards like this, risk assets are going to see further headwinds.

Crypto: 50% Users Invest To Improve Living Standards;"The crypto industry has experienced substantial expansion over the years, characterized by significant increases in both value and widespread adoption. What was once primarily associated with the dark web has transformed into a sector that is increasingly embraced by individuals worldwide. This transformation underscores the fact that crypto investments have transcended mere speculation for a significant portion of the population.
A recent survey conducted by Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, and published on Oct. 5, 2023, provides valuable insights into how digital assets are now instrumental in elevating living standards. These assets have been accomplishing various financial objectives for users around the world.
About half of crypto users, or around 50%, are directing their investments with the aim of enhancing their everyday living conditions. The survey’s findings indicate that in countries such as South Korea, Canada, and Turkey, 46%, 44%, and 41% of respondents, respectively, have identified this as their foremost financial goal when engaging in digital asset investments.
Moreover, the survey reveals that approximately 36% of participants from Malaysia and Taiwan place a higher priority on improving their family’s overall quality of life. This was when compared to other financial aspirations.
The extensive survey collected information during the period spanning from May to August. It included participation from more than 1,500 individuals representing 20 countries across Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, the United States, and Canada. 
Notably, the survey also illuminated diverse motivations among female crypto investors in different nations. For instance, in the United States and Turkey, around 27% of female crypto investors have their investment in crypto. It is mostly driven by the desire to finance their children’s education. In contrast, this particular goal was less prevalent in South Korea and Japan. Only 5% of female investors expressed the same aspiration.

In terms of Chinese involvement, the survey provided insights into the extent of engagement among crypto users in China. Despite the prohibition on crypto trading within the country, the survey findings suggest that Chinese citizens are actively in the crypto market.
A significant 18% of survey respondents from China stated that they had invested amounts ranging from $50,000 to $100,000. Amidst this, an additional 19% had committed investments between $100,000 and $500,000. It’s worth noting that Chinese nationals can still possess cryptocurrencies and navigate around the trading ban by using VPNs. Additionally, the ban does not apply to Chinese nationals who reside outside of China.

The year 2022 is destined to be remembered as one of the most challenging periods for the crypto industry. It witnessed a substantial decline, with Bitcoin, in particular, experiencing a loss exceeding 60% of its value. Additionally, the overall market incurred losses of just over $2 trillion during the year. Furthermore, this tumultuous period saw the downfall of several crypto firms. However, FTX was the most disruptive of them all. As Sam Bankman-Fried, the figure behind FTX, faces a jury that will determine his future, there are signs that confidence in the crypto market is gradually being reestablished.
In addition to these developments, Bitcoin [BTC] was observed making strides toward a path of resurgence. At press time, BTC was trading at $27,587.30, approaching the $28,000 mark.

Is JPEX Facing the Same Catastrophe as FTX Exchange? Here’s What Happening;"The post Is JPEX Facing the Same Catastrophe as FTX Exchange? Here’s What Happening appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
In recent events, the JPEX virtual asset trading platform(VATPs)in Hong Kong has come under scrutiny for its suspected involvement in a major fraud case. This development has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the current regulatory framework governing cryptocurrencies. Xu Zhengyu, a prominent financial commentator, has emphasized the urgent need for more robust oversight in the industry. This article delves into the JPEX scandal and the pressing demand for a comprehensive regulatory system for cryptocurrencies.
Hui Ching-yu, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury expressed his concerns during an investment committee interview program. He underscored that the JPEX scandal highlights the pressing need for regulatory supervision in the virtual asset sector. Furthermore, he pointed out a significant regulatory gap in Hong Kong — the absence of a stablecoin framework.
Xu Zhengyu, speaking in a live online program of the Investment and Financial Education Committee, shed light on the high risks associated with unregulated virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms often lack transparency and may operate without stability or reliability. In the event of disputes or platform failures, investors have limited avenues for recourse, potentially resulting in substantial financial losses. Notable incidents, like FTX’s collapse overseas and the recent JPEX case in Hong Kong, serve as stark reminders of these risks.
Many virtual asset trading platforms have historically relied on stablecoins like USDT as trading mediums. Xu Zhengyu emphasized the necessity for these coins to maintain value stability by being backed by US dollars or gold. However, past instances have demonstrated that stablecoins can experience significant price volatility or collapse. Xu stressed that the management of reserves by stablecoin issuers directly impacts price stability and investors’ ability to redeem fiat currencies. Given these challenges, Hong Kong has refrained from permitting retail trading in stablecoins until comprehensive regulations are in place.
To safeguard investor interests and prevent conflicts of interest, Huang Lexin, Director of the Licensing Section and Head of the Financial Technology Group of the Intermediary Department of the SFC, outlined certain restrictions for licensed virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms are prohibited from offering various investment products, including periodic “pledges,” interest collection services, deposits, and derivatives transactions.
Huang Lexin also noted that SFC-licensed virtual asset trading platforms are limited to facilitating the purchase and sale of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for retail investors. Any introduction of new currencies on these platforms must adhere to stringent reporting requirements and obtain approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission before becoming available for trading.

Bitcoin and altcoins pushing higher;"Friday has dawned brightly for the crypto sector and a push to the upside is taking place.
If stock markets fall, then this is certainly transferred to the crypto market, and being high risk assets, they are likely to fall hard. However, there are still fluctuations in markets, and they go up as well as down.
After five days of sideways action Bitcoin is rising once again.
Bitcoin found support towards the end of September at the $26,000 level and has been steadily trending upwards ever since. At time of going to press bitcoin is once more at the $27,600 resistance level, and finally taking this out and flipping it into support would be an important step in bitcoin’s climb higher.
Of course, there is still the thorny issue of the 200-week moving average just above, which previously stopped bitcoin in its tracks at $28,000. However, the trend is still up, and if bitcoin keeps knocking at this level it is likely to break through eventually.
If the Alpha beast of the crypto jungle rises then the altcoins will normally follow. Ethereum is having a strong day so far, and is currently butting up against resistance at $1,630. However, it does appear to be breaking the downwards trend from October 1, so look to $ETH to perhaps also break resistance.
Solana is having an even better day thus far. 3% up currently, $SOL is heading back to $24 at a fast rate of knots. The Solana community has its Breakpoint 2023 Conference coming up at the end of the month, and this perhaps why $SOL is moving strongly up again.
A bullish flag has been forming since the beginning of October, and $SOL looks to be breaking out. A measured move for the breakout would take the $SOL price to $29, flipping the resistance at $26 into support. 
Render ($RNDR) is another altcoin riding high. Up 1.75% on the day, $RNDR is battling resistance at $1.75. Should it overcome this, the next resistance at $1.80 awaits, with the 200-week moving average just above.
Render’s founder, Jules Urbach, is speaking at the Solana Breakpoint Conference. What he has to say is likely to be very interesting, although a ‘sell-the-news’ reaction on the $RNDR price may also be likely.

BCH Price Analysis: Will This Pattern Push BCH TO $300?;"The post BCH Price Analysis: Will This Pattern Push BCH TO $300? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
As the overall market recovers, with Bitcoin taking a bullish step in October, the altcoins are on a positive track. Even though the BCH price breached the $250 mark in the first two days of October with a remarkable growth of 10%. 
Despite this, the overhead supply pressure at the psychological level caused a sharp correction in the Bitcoin Cash market price. However, with the sentiment turning bullish, expectations for the Bitcoin Cash price prediction in 2023 remain optimistic.
Although there has been a recent correction, the overall trend of the BCH price suggests a bullish revival and a rise to higher levels. The bullish reversal from the buyers’ region at $180 and the 200-day EMA provided the Bitcoin Cash price with a springboard to regain momentum.
Moreover, the recent sharp correction to the $230 mark increases the chances of an inverted head and shoulder. Currently, the altcoin price trades at $231.50, with multiple Doji candle formations at the $230 support level.
With the underlying bullish sentiments averting downfall, the chances of BCH price taking a reversal to $250 are increasing. This recovery phase will complete the bullish pattern with the neckline at $250.
Technical indicators:
Coming to the technical indicators, the Directional Movement Index sustains a bullish point of view. 
DMI indicator: The ADX line (black line) has shot up in recent times, indicating a strong momentum. Additionally, the DI line remains bullish, signaling further recovery.
EMA: The 50 and 200-day EMA maintain a positive alignment and continue to rise higher, which certifies the uptrend in motion. 
With plans for a bullish reversal from $230, the inverted head and shoulder pattern presents a trend reversal opportunity in BCH price. However, if the price struggles to overcome the $250 mark, it may lead to a potential pullback to $228. 
However, the inverted head and shoulder breakout will increase the likelihood of Bitcoin Cash price exceeding $300. With the potential to continue the rally above, the reversal from $250 or the $250 breakout will prove a crucial entry point for sideline buyers. 
Considering the price breaks below the $228 post, the downtrend will plunge the prices to $200.

Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the 2023 ;"The post Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the 2023  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
After the crypto market euphoria of 2021, prices have cooled considerably in 2022 and early 2023. Bitcoin, Ethereum and most major cryptocurrencies are down 60-80% from their all-time highs. This bear market provides the perfect chance to accumulate top cryptocurrencies at discounted prices before the next major bull market.
Just as the stock market moves through periods of boom and bust, so too does the nascent cryptocurrency market follow predictable cycles. We have already witnessed this pattern with a bull run in 2017 giving way to a multi-year bear trend, before the huge surge in 2020-21. Now, as crypto winter sets in, savvy investors know that the best time to buy is when there is “blood in the streets.”
History has shown patience pays off handsomely for those accumulating top-tier crypto assets when prices are depressed. When the next wave of institutional and retail adoption comes, supply squeezes for scarce assets like Bitcoin will drive prices higher. Leading smart contract platforms like Ethereum will also benefit from further mainstream utilization in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, metaverse and Web3 applications.
This article highlights 5 of the most promising cryptocurrencies to add to your portfolio during the 2023 bear market. With fundamental development continuing apace despite price declines, our recommended crypto assets are prime to generate tremendous upside for investors with long time horizons. Periods of fear and uncertainty often provide the greatest opportunities – the forward-thinking will stake their claims now and reap substantial rewards during the next bull cycle.
Crypton‘s association with the Utopia P2P ecosystem makes it uniquely positioned for long-term success. Utopia is a decentralized network built for private, secure communication and data transmission. All financial transactions within the ecosystem are conducted using Crypton.
As a privacy coin, Crypton offers complete anonymity and untraceability for transactions. This is accomplished through cryptographic signing and encryption to protect against fraud and ensure the security of funds. For cryptocurrency investors and users concerned about privacy, Crypton checks all the right boxes.
The instant, irreversible settlement of Crypton transactions also makes it attractive as a payment method. Merchants and vendors can benefit from fast transaction times without the risk of reversal. These are advantages Crypton has over traditional fiat currency payment rails.
Crypton can also be earned through mining to support the Utopia network infrastructure. This promotes greater decentralization and alignment of incentives. Miners earn newly minted Crypton as well as interest on their balances, providing recurring yield.
Importantly, Crypton has a real-world use case powering the Utopia ecosystem. It is not just an abstract investment asset. Adoption of Utopia for private communication and transactions will drive Demand for Crypton over time.
For cryptocurrency investors interested in privacy, security, speed, and an associated ecosystem, Crypton checks all the boxes. As Utopia continues growing, it represents an asymmetric opportunity compared to other crypto assets. For these reasons, Crypton is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to invest in for the long-term.
AQLA is designed to capitalize on the massive and rapidly growing carbon offset market, estimated to reach $250 billion by Morgan Stanley. With global carbon emissions continuing to rise, the need for carbon offsets and mitigation projects will only increase in the coming years.
AQLA aims to bring credibility and transparency to carbon offsets by recording them on its blockchain platform. This provides tamper-proof verification of the offsets and allows them to be tokenized and traded efficiently. The blockchain approach solves key issues like double-counting and verification that have hindered the offset market’s growth.
The project has a global vision of promoting awareness and enabling businesses to adopt carbon neutral practices. As climate change concerns grow, this first-mover advantage in the blockchain carbon space gives AQLA huge room for adoption. Its standards and methodologies align with major international climate agreements as well.
Additionally, AQLA is actively developing real-world use cases in voluntary carbon markets to back green technologies. This creates utility and demand for the AQLA token beyond just speculation. The wider applicability in ESG solutions also expands its total addressable market.
With environmental sustainability becoming increasingly important worldwide, AQLA is a purpose-built solution catering to massive needs. Its blockchain platform and token allow climate action to scale exponentially. For investors, getting in early with AQLA provides exposure to a rapidly expanding space. The project’s sustainability focus also gives it an ethical edge over other crypto offerings.
XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, an open-source, decentralized blockchain created by Ripple Labs. It is designed to facilitate fast, affordable global financial transactions.
A key advantage of XRP is its speed – transactions settle in 3-5 seconds. This makes it well-suited for cross-border payments and currency exchanges where slow processing times currently cause delays and high costs. Financial institutions can save significant time and money by using XRP.
Additionally, XRP has very low transaction fees at a fraction of a penny per transaction. This scalable cost structure allows XRP to handle high transaction volumes without becoming prohibitively expensive.
Ripple is aggressively pushing adoption of XRP by partnering with major financial institutions and money transfer services globally. These partnerships are critical for giving XRP real-world utility and payment volume to drive demand.
Developments like Ripple’s acquisition of a money transfer service and XRP’s increasing use for cheaper remittances in emerging markets demonstrate this adoption. As more entities utilize XRP for liquidity and payments, its status as a leading digital asset will solidify.
With a large circulating supply, XRP can handle massive transaction volumes without illiquidity. The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and XRP is well positioned to emerge as an enterprise-grade asset especially for financial transactions. For investors, getting onboard this growing use case early could provide substantial long-term upside.
Dogecoin stands out from other cryptocurrencies because of its branding and approachability as the original “fun and friendly” internet money. The Doge meme makes it more accessible to the mainstream public versus other cryptos with obscure names or technical focus.
This friendliness has translated to fast adoption and community growth, with Dogecoin boasting over 4 million followers across social media. The large passionate community gives Dogecoin strength and viral potential that many coins lack.
A major recent development was Elon Musk’s endorsement of Dogecoin and self-proclaimed status as the “Dogefather.” Musk has an unparalleled influence in the crypto space and frequently promotes Dogecoin to his millions of followers. This high-profile celebrity backing sets Dogecoin apart.
Unlike Bitcoin which has a hard cap of 21 million coins, Dogecoin’s supply increases 5 billion coins per year. This makes it better suited as a transactional currency because more supply prevents deflationary spirals as demand rises. The inflationary dynamic encourages spending versus just HODLing the coin.
For investors, Dogecoin offers asymmetric upside because of its extremely low price compared to other major cryptos. Despite its beginnings as a joke, Dogecoin’s brand appeal, passionate community, influential backers, and transactional use case give it a unique advantage that should not be underestimated going forward.
BAD IDEA combines three highly promising technologies – AI, blockchain, and DAOs – into one ambitious experiment. It is unique in letting decentralized AI agents participate equally in governance and decision-making. If successful, this could pioneer a new model for blockchain projects.
Allowing AI agents to have voting rights and manage treasury funds autonomously is innovative. The agents can dynamically adjust the tokenomics and monetary policy based on data versus being locked into a rigid set of rules. This gives BAD IDEA the flexibility to optimize sustainability.
The project produces thought-provoking content on integrating AI into blockchain and Web3. This demonstrates real-world applications versus being just a speculative asset. BAD IDEA aims to address complex issues like climate change through decentralized collaboration.
Although named tongue-in-cheek, BAD IDEA is seriously researching the possibilities of AI-powered governance. The token distribution allocates funds for different development branches to incentivize continuous innovation.
With AI playing an increasing role across industries, BAD IDEA is getting ahead of the curve by researching how to harmonize AI with human governance. The project welcomes community feedback and participation, creating a collaborative environment.
For investors, BAD IDEA offers exposure to a potentially game-changing decentralized governance model. The project’s growth is connected directly to real R&D versus hype, giving it fundamental substance.
The cryptocurrency market is always evolving with new innovative projects and economic cycles. While prices have declined in 2022 from the highs, this bear period provides the perfect chance to research and invest in projects with strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential. The five cryptocurrencies discussed in this article – Crypton, AQLA, XRP, Dogecoin, and BAD IDEA Token – are leaders in their respective categories and have major developments on the horizon.
Whether it is the privacy and security of Crypton fueling Utopia, the carbon offset potential of AQLA, the speed and scalability of XRP for payments, the mainstream brand appeal of Dogecoin, or the cutting-edge governance experiment of the BAD IDEA Token – each cryptocurrency offers investors an intriguing asymmetric opportunity. The markets may be driven by fear and uncertainty now, but the future remains bright for blockchain technology. Maintaining a long-term horizon and accumulating promising crypto assets during bear markets has proven to be a winning strategy throughout the history of this nascent asset class.

The post Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the 2023  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
After the crypto market euphoria of 2021, prices have cooled considerably in 2022 and early 2023. Bitcoin, Ethereum and most major cryptocurrencies are down 60-80% from their all-time highs. This bear market provides the perfect chance to accumulate top cryptocurrencies at discounted prices before the next major bull market.
Just as the stock market moves through periods of boom and bust, so too does the nascent cryptocurrency market follow predictable cycles. We have already witnessed this pattern with a bull run in 2017 giving way to a multi-year bear trend, before the huge surge in 2020-21. Now, as crypto winter sets in, savvy investors know that the best time to buy is when there is “blood in the streets.”
History has shown patience pays off handsomely for those accumulating top-tier crypto assets when prices are depressed. When the next wave of institutional and retail adoption comes, supply squeezes for scarce assets like Bitcoin will drive prices higher. Leading smart contract platforms like Ethereum will also benefit from further mainstream utilization in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, metaverse and Web3 applications.
This article highlights 5 of the most promising cryptocurrencies to add to your portfolio during the 2023 bear market. With fundamental development continuing apace despite price declines, our recommended crypto assets are prime to generate tremendous upside for investors with long time horizons. Periods of fear and uncertainty often provide the greatest opportunities – the forward-thinking will stake their claims now and reap substantial rewards during the next bull cycle.

ThorChain Hits Record-Setting $355 Million Trading Volume in a Day;"ThorChain, a decentralized liquidity protocol, reported a record-breaking transaction volume on Oct. 5, with the number surging to $355 million in a single day, marking an all-time high.
This noteworthy event is part of a larger trend as the cumulative transaction volume over the past five days has surpassed the $1 billion mark.
According to the analysis, the surge in transaction volume coincided with the rise in swap counts associated with the network. On Oct. 5, when the transaction volume was close to $355 million, the count of swaps related to the network was 115,630.
This was an upward surge compared to the preceding day, when the swap count was 61,877, and the total volume was merely $170.8 million.
The daily change in transaction volume from Oct. 4 to Oct. 5 was a massive 107.6% increase.
A look at the charts indicates an upward trajectory in the transaction volumes since Sept. 29. While the network reported just about $34.45 million as total volume on Sept. 29, the value increased to $60.14 million the next day and $166.4 by Oct. 1.
Later, on Oct. 2, the total transaction volume made a new high of $197.33 million before minor plunges were noted at $173.84 million and $170.84 million between Oct. 3 and 4, respectively. Between Oct. 1 and 5, the cumulative transaction volume was $1.063 billion.
As the transaction volumes seemingly surged, so did the earnings volume associated with the network. On Oct. 4, the liquidity earning was about $109K, and the bond earning stood at $66.7K, a major decline from the highs recorded on Oct. 2. However, on Oct. 5, the liquidity and bond earnings stood at $164.35K and $101.96K, respectively.
As per analysts, the sudden volume surge can be linked to increased hacking activities recently, especially with cross-chain BTC transactions being the main contributor to the massive volume surge.
To address these adverse events, reports indicate that ThorSwap, a product of ThorChain, has paused the platform, shifting into maintenance mode.
When speaking of the developments, ThorSwap developer tweeted;
“Yesterday, following a careful evaluation of the situation and consultation with advisors, legal counsel, and law enforcement, the decision was made to temporarily transition the THORSwap interface into maintenance mode. This action was taken to swiftly curtail any further potential illicit activity.”
Fellow THORChads,
A pressing and persistent concern has recently come to light: the potential movement of illicit funds through THORChain and, specifically, THORSwap. Such activities have no place on the THORSwap platform, and THORSwap stands firmly against any and all criminal…
— THORSwap  #BetterThanCEX (@THORSwap) October 6, 2023

The tweet noted that ThorSwap will remain in this mode till the developers find a more permanent solution to implement and bolster the platform’s continued security and integrity.
The native token of the ThorChain network, Rune, has been trading in the red for most of the past 24 hours. Starting the day at 2.048, the token surged to $2.1 before plunging to a low of about $1.93. Reports indicate that the token has lost about 2,51% in value in the 24 hours from October 5 till the reporting time.
However, the story is quite different in the past seven days, with Rune trading in the green. Starting at $1.92 on Sept. 29, Rune surged to a high of $2.23 on Oct. 2 before falling to a low of $1.88 on Oct. 4.
The charts suggest that the assets have mainly shown a sideways price action, especially in the past five days. However, in the past week, Rune has gained about 3.02% in value.

‘Trading Through Gamification Can Represent the Future’ Says Banksters’ Alexandru Carbunariu;"While centralized exchanges (cexs) are instrumental in helping new users grasp all things crypto, they nevertheless do not go “the extra mile in educating their audience properly,” Alexandru Carbunariu, the CMO at the edutech simulator Banksters, has asserted. According to Carbunariu, a Web3 advisor, properly educating newbies includes making the experience more interactive and fun. He added that Web3 platforms should take a leaf out of their Web2 counterparts’ playbook.
Expanding on the argument that education should be more fun, the CMO said he concurred with those who believe gamification to be the right way of encouraging more positive trading behavior. However, Carbunariu told Bitcoin.com News that while “trading through gamification may represent the future,” many of the current Web3 games may “have taken a wrong turn.”
When asked for his thoughts on the so-called trade-to-win strategy, the Banksters CMO insisted that such a model is better than play-to-earn (P2E) models because it engenders confidence. He suggested that such a model can be ideal for newcomers. Meanwhile, in written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, Carbunariu also articulated why competition is necessary for Web3 platforms looking to get communities attached to their respective products.
Below are Alexandru Carbunariu‘s responses to all questions sent.
Bitcoin.com News (BCN): Centralized exchanges (cexs) are one of the gateways to all things crypto for new users and most of them have taken on the job of educating newcomers. In your opinion, what can they do better or differently to bring in more Web2 users via education?
Alexandru Carbunariu (AC): Speaking from experience, centralized exchanges don’t take the extra mile in educating their audience properly. A lot more things should be done in terms of education, to make it more fun, more rewarding as well as more interactive. We should check what Web2 asset platforms do and get inspired by their work. We rarely see that in Web3. However, we believe that with new regulations, specific training models will come up.
What needs to be done in order to attract Web2 users:
Create interactive training that will provide incentives (like we have seen Revolut doing).
Use normal KOLs [key opinion leaders] to present their products in a transparent [way] but also using normal non-technical language.
Try to introduce academy programs, where normal users can attend, therefore the knowledge will be much higher. Provide transparency when involving risks. Introduce alerts when the user is lost in the complex UX / UI of the platform.
BCN: Do you believe gamification is the right approach to encouraging positive crypto trading behavior with long-term benefits?
AC: Of course. Creating a more fun environment can be relaxing for the user, and if you don’t mix that with financial loss, it’s actually perfect. We are one of the first to build this type of concept. Our A/B tests, focus groups as well user validation were high, meaning that we were on the right track.
I believe that the Web3 games have taken a wrong turn, and the project owners have lost focus. Web3 should be the gateway to the future and it should provide new ways, apart from the traditional ones, in order to onboard as many users.
Trading through gamification can represent the future. First users need to understand it, then they will trade or invest with caution. If their first experience provides them with losses, then they are unlikely to come back. This is why Banksters has stepped in and is helping them to understand more about crypto, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and trading.

BCN: Can you describe what the trade-to-win model is all about and how this differs from play-to-earn?
AC: In the past 2-3 years we have seen the “P2E” as well as the “P&E” types. One thing they have in common is the fact that they have not identified a balance that will give them a much-needed token stability.
Our Trade2Win model lets the user:
First test the product
Learn about the product
Play around with it
And become a winner
This is the model that provides more confidence, and the rewards will come only at the end, meaning if you are a winner then the rewards will be won. This is a more or less “shadow” plan from the trading world, where you need to practice, learn, trade and then gain profits.
BCN: Trading is an umbrella term that encompasses various strategies based on an individual’s mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors. How does your platform help users figure out an optimal strategy for them through low-risk education?
AC: This is a very good question. To give a more of a straight answer: Yes and No. Basically, we can cover this through our so-called “Abilities” which can be compared with “Superpowers” a hero avatar has in the Web2 games. Abilities actually “copy” what is happening on the real market. There are abilities like:
Elon Musk Tweet
Vitalik’s Support
CZ’s Effect
Market Squeeze
Pump and Dump
Hype
Insider Trade
These are real-life trading events, and in many cases, traders or users don’t understand them. What Banksters did was to analyze all of the historical pricing for these events, develop a price algorithm then infuse them into these Abilities.
Now the user will understand what happens to their portfolio and how it will react when these Abilities are used. This actually provides no risk for the user as well as covers a new mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors.
BCN: Whether it’s crypto trading or something else, competition is often an integral part of that. How is Banksters encouraging competition among users?
AC: They are highly competitive! We often have tournaments and live streams which reward users with real USDT. It drives them to use the product and makes them happy with both the game but also the environment.
We strongly believe that competitions, challenges, tournaments and livestreams definitely help the community being attached to the product, while the team can gather transparent and vital feedback.
BCN: When discussing factors holding back large-scale adoption of crypto, lack of education and intuitive user interface (UI) often get the most attention. However, could it be that we have not had mass adoption because the crypto ecosystem is still struggling to find the product-market fit?
AC: Another good question. The answer is pretty simple. It’s about money. However, it’s more than that. For example:
Users:
A lot of people have lost their hard-earned money during the bear market while listening to the unprepared and uneducated key opinion leaders (KOLs) who often accept to promote projects with no filters.
Project Owners:
If one puts two years and $10,000 in the right way, they could raise between $500,000 and a million dollars while having absolutely no experience in blockchain tech, development, management, marketing, or product growth. This, however, has changed and now a lot of Web2 specialists are entering the Web3 space and I believe the standard will go just higher.
Centralized Exchanges:
Providing crazy leverages, with no education, with no warning, and to top all that with FTX keeping their crypto wallet keys in a Google form.
At the end of the day, human nature had to kick in, meaning something terrible had to happen in order for something to be changed.
I think Web3 has gone through a reset in the past 2-3 years, and now, finally, we can see some highly professional projects with funding resources delivering innovative products. Such projects have higher odds of finding product-market fit and accelerating adoption.

This is why Banksters has stepped in and is helping them to understand more about crypto, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and trading.

BCN: Can you describe what the trade-to-win model is all about and how this differs from play-to-earn?
AC: In the past 2-3 years we have seen the “P2E” as well as the “P&E” types. One thing they have in common is the fact that they have not identified a balance that will give them a much-needed token stability.
Our Trade2Win model lets the user:
First test the product
Learn about the product
Play around with it
And become a winner
This is the model that provides more confidence, and the rewards will come only at the end, meaning if you are a winner then the rewards will be won. This is a more or less “shadow” plan from the trading world, where you need to practice, learn, trade and then gain profits.
BCN: Trading is an umbrella term that encompasses various strategies based on an individual’s mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors. How does your platform help users figure out an optimal strategy for them through low-risk education?
AC: This is a very good question. To give a more of a straight answer: Yes and No. Basically, we can cover this through our so-called “Abilities” which can be compared with “Superpowers” a hero avatar has in the Web2 games. Abilities actually “copy” what is happening on the real market. There are abilities like:
Elon Musk Tweet
Vitalik’s Support
CZ’s Effect
Market Squeeze
Pump and Dump
Hype
Insider Trade
These are real-life trading events, and in many cases, traders or users don’t understand them. What Banksters did was to analyze all of the historical pricing for these events, develop a price algorithm then infuse them into these Abilities.
Now the user will understand what happens to their portfolio and how it will react when these Abilities are used. This actually provides no risk for the user as well as covers a new mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors.
BCN: Whether it’s crypto trading or something else, competition is often an integral part of that. How is Banksters encouraging competition among users?
AC: They are highly competitive! We often have tournaments and live streams which reward users with real USDT. It drives them to use the product and makes them happy with both the game but also the environment.
We strongly believe that competitions, challenges, tournaments and livestreams definitely help the community being attached to the product, while the team can gather transparent and vital feedback.
BCN: When discussing factors holding back large-scale adoption of crypto, lack of education and intuitive user interface (UI) often get the most attention. However, could it be that we have not had mass adoption because the crypto ecosystem is still struggling to find the product-market fit?
AC: Another good question. The answer is pretty simple. It’s about money. However, it’s more than that. For example:
Users:
A lot of people have lost their hard-earned money during the bear market while listening to the unprepared and uneducated key opinion leaders (KOLs) who often accept to promote projects with no filters.
Project Owners:
If one puts two years and $10,000 in the right way, they could raise between $500,000 and a million dollars while having absolutely no experience in blockchain tech, development, management, marketing, or product growth. This, however, has changed and now a lot of Web2 specialists are entering the Web3 space and I believe the standard will go just higher.
Centralized Exchanges:
Providing crazy leverages, with no education, with no warning, and to top all that with FTX keeping their crypto wallet keys in a Google form.
At the end of the day, human nature had to kick in, meaning something terrible had to happen in order for something to be changed.
I think Web3 has gone through a reset in the past 2-3 years, and now, finally, we can see some highly professional projects with funding resources delivering innovative products. Such projects have higher odds of finding product-market fit and accelerating adoption.

Bitcoin And Crypto Under The Lens As Bond Market Recalls 2008 Crash;"As the global financial landscape witnesses a seismic shift, reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble burst, alarm bells are ringing in the bond market, alerting the Bitcoin and crypto market as well.
Renowned Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Genevieve Roch-Decter, highlighted the striking parallels in a recent tweet, stating, “I can’t believe I am saying this but the slump in 10-year and 30-year bonds is approaching the epic drops we saw in stocks during the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble bust.”
Bloomberg Surveillance’s Lisa Abramowicz reinforces this grim narrative, pointing out that “bonds maturing in 10 years or more have slumped 46% since peaking in March 2020, just shy of the 49% plunge in US stocks in the aftermath of the dot-com bust. The route in 30-year bonds has been even worse, tumbling 53%.”
Onramp, a Bitcoin asset management platform, adds further context by emphasizing the historic nature of the trend. This decline, particularly in bonds with maturities exceeding a decade, harkens back to market downturns like the dot-com bubble collapse. The Federal Reserve’s resolute stance on inflation and a fragile fiscal environment have disrupted the traditional appeal of long-maturity debt, raising questions about the possibility of a debt spiral.
The situation is further complicated by the behavior of the yield curve. Historically, an inverted yield curve has foreshadowed recessions. However, the recent correction has seen a rare “bear steepener,” marked by rising long-term yields. This phenomenon, seen in the past before recessions, raises concerns of an impending economic downturn.
“While some question the yield curve’s reliability as a recession indicator, the current bear steepening suggests that an economic downturn could be imminent. This is particularly concerning given the Fed’s ongoing commitment to restrictive monetary policy, making the situation ripe for potential market volatility and economic uncertainty, “ Dylan LeClair from Onramp notes.
Meanwhile, Barclays’ analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha suggests that only a stock market crash could halt the bond market’s decline. Unlike previous cycles, traditional bond backstops are dwindling, with the Fed shifting from a net buyer to a net seller, and foreign institutional buying slowing.
This highlights the stark disconnect between equity valuations and long-end bond rates, with stocks having significant room for devaluation before bonds stabilize. And if stocks crash, Bitcoin and crypto could be just as affected.
The turmoil in the bond market has far-reaching implications, including its impact on Bitcoin and crypto. Remarkably, the crypto market has never experienced such a situation, but there are general observations of how risk assets have reacted in such environments in the past.
First, rising treasury yields make risk-free returns more attractive, potentially prompting some investors to reallocate capital from risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto to treasury bills. This shift could decrease demand, putting downward pressure on their prices.
Moreover, a sharp rise in 10-year Treasury yields can signal a tighter monetary policy, weighing on risk assets. Higher yields also mean higher borrowing costs, which can impact crypto. When interest rates rise, non-interest-bearing assets like Bitcoin may seem less attractive compared to yield-bearing assets.
A significant increase in Treasury yields can also lead to reduced liquidity in other financial markets, such as the Bitcoin and crypto space. Institutional investors facing liquidity constraints may liquidate more liquid assets like BTC and altcoins causing potential price declines.
Lastly, sharp yield increases can create volatility across various asset classes as investors seek to reduce risk or cover losses elsewhere. Bitcoin and crypto are highly influenced by market sentiment and speculative behavior. The market’s interpretation of rising yields can sway investor behavior, impacting crypto prices.
Accordingly, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, recently predicted:
The 10YR is up another 10% since! […] The Fed wants more unemployment. The job market is still too strong. They’ve raised the expected 2024 rates as a result and the 10YR has broken out to new decade highs. As long as the 10YR is breaking upwards like this, risk assets are going to see further headwinds.
At press time, BTC traded at $27,576.

Crypto: 50% Users Invest To Improve Living Standards;"The crypto industry has experienced substantial expansion over the years, characterized by significant increases in both value and widespread adoption. What was once primarily associated with the dark web has transformed into a sector that is increasingly embraced by individuals worldwide. This transformation underscores the fact that crypto investments have transcended mere speculation for a significant portion of the population.
A recent survey conducted by Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, and published on Oct. 5, 2023, provides valuable insights into how digital assets are now instrumental in elevating living standards. These assets have been accomplishing various financial objectives for users around the world.
About half of crypto users, or around 50%, are directing their investments with the aim of enhancing their everyday living conditions. The survey’s findings indicate that in countries such as South Korea, Canada, and Turkey, 46%, 44%, and 41% of respondents, respectively, have identified this as their foremost financial goal when engaging in digital asset investments.
Moreover, the survey reveals that approximately 36% of participants from Malaysia and Taiwan place a higher priority on improving their family’s overall quality of life. This was when compared to other financial aspirations.
The extensive survey collected information during the period spanning from May to August. It included participation from more than 1,500 individuals representing 20 countries across Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, the United States, and Canada. 
Notably, the survey also illuminated diverse motivations among female crypto investors in different nations. For instance, in the United States and Turkey, around 27% of female crypto investors have their investment in crypto. It is mostly driven by the desire to finance their children’s education. In contrast, this particular goal was less prevalent in South Korea and Japan. Only 5% of female investors expressed the same aspiration.

In terms of Chinese involvement, the survey provided insights into the extent of engagement among crypto users in China. Despite the prohibition on crypto trading within the country, the survey findings suggest that Chinese citizens are actively in the crypto market.
A significant 18% of survey respondents from China stated that they had invested amounts ranging from $50,000 to $100,000. Amidst this, an additional 19% had committed investments between $100,000 and $500,000. It’s worth noting that Chinese nationals can still possess cryptocurrencies and navigate around the trading ban by using VPNs. Additionally, the ban does not apply to Chinese nationals who reside outside of China.

The year 2022 is destined to be remembered as one of the most challenging periods for the crypto industry. It witnessed a substantial decline, with Bitcoin, in particular, experiencing a loss exceeding 60% of its value. Additionally, the overall market incurred losses of just over $2 trillion during the year. Furthermore, this tumultuous period saw the downfall of several crypto firms. However, FTX was the most disruptive of them all. As Sam Bankman-Fried, the figure behind FTX, faces a jury that will determine his future, there are signs that confidence in the crypto market is gradually being reestablished.
In addition to these developments, Bitcoin [BTC] was observed making strides toward a path of resurgence. At press time, BTC was trading at $27,587.30, approaching the $28,000 mark.

Is JPEX Facing the Same Catastrophe as FTX Exchange? Here’s What Happening;"The post Is JPEX Facing the Same Catastrophe as FTX Exchange? Here’s What Happening appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
In recent events, the JPEX virtual asset trading platform(VATPs)in Hong Kong has come under scrutiny for its suspected involvement in a major fraud case. This development has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the current regulatory framework governing cryptocurrencies. Xu Zhengyu, a prominent financial commentator, has emphasized the urgent need for more robust oversight in the industry. This article delves into the JPEX scandal and the pressing demand for a comprehensive regulatory system for cryptocurrencies.
Hui Ching-yu, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury expressed his concerns during an investment committee interview program. He underscored that the JPEX scandal highlights the pressing need for regulatory supervision in the virtual asset sector. Furthermore, he pointed out a significant regulatory gap in Hong Kong — the absence of a stablecoin framework.
Xu Zhengyu, speaking in a live online program of the Investment and Financial Education Committee, shed light on the high risks associated with unregulated virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms often lack transparency and may operate without stability or reliability. In the event of disputes or platform failures, investors have limited avenues for recourse, potentially resulting in substantial financial losses. Notable incidents, like FTX’s collapse overseas and the recent JPEX case in Hong Kong, serve as stark reminders of these risks.
Many virtual asset trading platforms have historically relied on stablecoins like USDT as trading mediums. Xu Zhengyu emphasized the necessity for these coins to maintain value stability by being backed by US dollars or gold. However, past instances have demonstrated that stablecoins can experience significant price volatility or collapse. Xu stressed that the management of reserves by stablecoin issuers directly impacts price stability and investors’ ability to redeem fiat currencies. Given these challenges, Hong Kong has refrained from permitting retail trading in stablecoins until comprehensive regulations are in place.
To safeguard investor interests and prevent conflicts of interest, Huang Lexin, Director of the Licensing Section and Head of the Financial Technology Group of the Intermediary Department of the SFC, outlined certain restrictions for licensed virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms are prohibited from offering various investment products, including periodic “pledges,” interest collection services, deposits, and derivatives transactions.
Huang Lexin also noted that SFC-licensed virtual asset trading platforms are limited to facilitating the purchase and sale of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for retail investors. Any introduction of new currencies on these platforms must adhere to stringent reporting requirements and obtain approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission before becoming available for trading.

Bitcoin and altcoins pushing higher;"Friday has dawned brightly for the crypto sector and a push to the upside is taking place.
If stock markets fall, then this is certainly transferred to the crypto market, and being high risk assets, they are likely to fall hard. However, there are still fluctuations in markets, and they go up as well as down.
After five days of sideways action Bitcoin is rising once again.
Bitcoin found support towards the end of September at the $26,000 level and has been steadily trending upwards ever since. At time of going to press bitcoin is once more at the $27,600 resistance level, and finally taking this out and flipping it into support would be an important step in bitcoin’s climb higher.
Of course, there is still the thorny issue of the 200-week moving average just above, which previously stopped bitcoin in its tracks at $28,000. However, the trend is still up, and if bitcoin keeps knocking at this level it is likely to break through eventually.
If the Alpha beast of the crypto jungle rises then the altcoins will normally follow. Ethereum is having a strong day so far, and is currently butting up against resistance at $1,630. However, it does appear to be breaking the downwards trend from October 1, so look to $ETH to perhaps also break resistance.
Solana is having an even better day thus far. 3% up currently, $SOL is heading back to $24 at a fast rate of knots. The Solana community has its Breakpoint 2023 Conference coming up at the end of the month, and this perhaps why $SOL is moving strongly up again.
A bullish flag has been forming since the beginning of October, and $SOL looks to be breaking out. A measured move for the breakout would take the $SOL price to $29, flipping the resistance at $26 into support. 
Render ($RNDR) is another altcoin riding high. Up 1.75% on the day, $RNDR is battling resistance at $1.75. Should it overcome this, the next resistance at $1.80 awaits, with the 200-week moving average just above.
Render’s founder, Jules Urbach, is speaking at the Solana Breakpoint Conference. What he has to say is likely to be very interesting, although a ‘sell-the-news’ reaction on the $RNDR price may also be likely.

Bitcoin increasingly accessible as small investors accelerate accumulation;"The investing ecosystem for Bitcoin is witnessing a prominent shift as ‘Bitcoin shrimps,’ a term referring to investors owning less than one Bitcoin, are making notable strides in the accumulation process.
This year has seen a steady increase in this group’s accumulation activities, detectable for the first time in its prominent deep blue color coding. Over this period, the total Bitcoin supply held collectively by this group has reached a marked 1.4 million Bitcoin.
Within the last 30 days alone, this accumulation trend has seen an additional 24,000 Bitcoins added to their holdings. This emerging trend underscores a diversifying Bitcoin landscape and demonstrates the increasing accessibility and widespread acceptance of cryptocurrency among a broad range of investors.

BCH Price Analysis: Will This Pattern Push BCH TO $300?;"The post BCH Price Analysis: Will This Pattern Push BCH TO $300? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
As the overall market recovers, with Bitcoin taking a bullish step in October, the altcoins are on a positive track. Even though the BCH price breached the $250 mark in the first two days of October with a remarkable growth of 10%. 
Despite this, the overhead supply pressure at the psychological level caused a sharp correction in the Bitcoin Cash market price. However, with the sentiment turning bullish, expectations for the Bitcoin Cash price prediction in 2023 remain optimistic.
Although there has been a recent correction, the overall trend of the BCH price suggests a bullish revival and a rise to higher levels. The bullish reversal from the buyers’ region at $180 and the 200-day EMA provided the Bitcoin Cash price with a springboard to regain momentum.
Moreover, the recent sharp correction to the $230 mark increases the chances of an inverted head and shoulder. Currently, the altcoin price trades at $231.50, with multiple Doji candle formations at the $230 support level.
With the underlying bullish sentiments averting downfall, the chances of BCH price taking a reversal to $250 are increasing. This recovery phase will complete the bullish pattern with the neckline at $250.
Technical indicators:
Coming to the technical indicators, the Directional Movement Index sustains a bullish point of view. 
DMI indicator: The ADX line (black line) has shot up in recent times, indicating a strong momentum. Additionally, the DI line remains bullish, signaling further recovery.
EMA: The 50 and 200-day EMA maintain a positive alignment and continue to rise higher, which certifies the uptrend in motion. 
With plans for a bullish reversal from $230, the inverted head and shoulder pattern presents a trend reversal opportunity in BCH price. However, if the price struggles to overcome the $250 mark, it may lead to a potential pullback to $228. 
However, the inverted head and shoulder breakout will increase the likelihood of Bitcoin Cash price exceeding $300. With the potential to continue the rally above, the reversal from $250 or the $250 breakout will prove a crucial entry point for sideline buyers. 
Considering the price breaks below the $228 post, the downtrend will plunge the prices to $200.

However, the inverted head and shoulder breakout will increase the likelihood of Bitcoin Cash price exceeding $300. With the potential to continue the rally above, the reversal from $250 or the $250 breakout will prove a crucial entry point for sideline buyers. 
Considering the price breaks below the $228 post, the downtrend will plunge the prices to $200.

Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the 2023 ;"The post Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the 2023  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
After the crypto market euphoria of 2021, prices have cooled considerably in 2022 and early 2023. Bitcoin, Ethereum and most major cryptocurrencies are down 60-80% from their all-time highs. This bear market provides the perfect chance to accumulate top cryptocurrencies at discounted prices before the next major bull market.
Just as the stock market moves through periods of boom and bust, so too does the nascent cryptocurrency market follow predictable cycles. We have already witnessed this pattern with a bull run in 2017 giving way to a multi-year bear trend, before the huge surge in 2020-21. Now, as crypto winter sets in, savvy investors know that the best time to buy is when there is “blood in the streets.”
History has shown patience pays off handsomely for those accumulating top-tier crypto assets when prices are depressed. When the next wave of institutional and retail adoption comes, supply squeezes for scarce assets like Bitcoin will drive prices higher. Leading smart contract platforms like Ethereum will also benefit from further mainstream utilization in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, metaverse and Web3 applications.
This article highlights 5 of the most promising cryptocurrencies to add to your portfolio during the 2023 bear market. With fundamental development continuing apace despite price declines, our recommended crypto assets are prime to generate tremendous upside for investors with long time horizons. Periods of fear and uncertainty often provide the greatest opportunities – the forward-thinking will stake their claims now and reap substantial rewards during the next bull cycle.
Crypton‘s association with the Utopia P2P ecosystem makes it uniquely positioned for long-term success. Utopia is a decentralized network built for private, secure communication and data transmission. All financial transactions within the ecosystem are conducted using Crypton.
As a privacy coin, Crypton offers complete anonymity and untraceability for transactions. This is accomplished through cryptographic signing and encryption to protect against fraud and ensure the security of funds. For cryptocurrency investors and users concerned about privacy, Crypton checks all the right boxes.
The instant, irreversible settlement of Crypton transactions also makes it attractive as a payment method. Merchants and vendors can benefit from fast transaction times without the risk of reversal. These are advantages Crypton has over traditional fiat currency payment rails.
Crypton can also be earned through mining to support the Utopia network infrastructure. This promotes greater decentralization and alignment of incentives. Miners earn newly minted Crypton as well as interest on their balances, providing recurring yield.
Importantly, Crypton has a real-world use case powering the Utopia ecosystem. It is not just an abstract investment asset. Adoption of Utopia for private communication and transactions will drive Demand for Crypton over time.
For cryptocurrency investors interested in privacy, security, speed, and an associated ecosystem, Crypton checks all the boxes. As Utopia continues growing, it represents an asymmetric opportunity compared to other crypto assets. For these reasons, Crypton is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to invest in for the long-term.
AQLA is designed to capitalize on the massive and rapidly growing carbon offset market, estimated to reach $250 billion by Morgan Stanley. With global carbon emissions continuing to rise, the need for carbon offsets and mitigation projects will only increase in the coming years.
AQLA aims to bring credibility and transparency to carbon offsets by recording them on its blockchain platform. This provides tamper-proof verification of the offsets and allows them to be tokenized and traded efficiently. The blockchain approach solves key issues like double-counting and verification that have hindered the offset market’s growth.
The project has a global vision of promoting awareness and enabling businesses to adopt carbon neutral practices. As climate change concerns grow, this first-mover advantage in the blockchain carbon space gives AQLA huge room for adoption. Its standards and methodologies align with major international climate agreements as well.
Additionally, AQLA is actively developing real-world use cases in voluntary carbon markets to back green technologies. This creates utility and demand for the AQLA token beyond just speculation. The wider applicability in ESG solutions also expands its total addressable market.
With environmental sustainability becoming increasingly important worldwide, AQLA is a purpose-built solution catering to massive needs. Its blockchain platform and token allow climate action to scale exponentially. For investors, getting in early with AQLA provides exposure to a rapidly expanding space. The project’s sustainability focus also gives it an ethical edge over other crypto offerings.
XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, an open-source, decentralized blockchain created by Ripple Labs. It is designed to facilitate fast, affordable global financial transactions.
A key advantage of XRP is its speed – transactions settle in 3-5 seconds. This makes it well-suited for cross-border payments and currency exchanges where slow processing times currently cause delays and high costs. Financial institutions can save significant time and money by using XRP.
Additionally, XRP has very low transaction fees at a fraction of a penny per transaction. This scalable cost structure allows XRP to handle high transaction volumes without becoming prohibitively expensive.
Ripple is aggressively pushing adoption of XRP by partnering with major financial institutions and money transfer services globally. These partnerships are critical for giving XRP real-world utility and payment volume to drive demand.
Developments like Ripple’s acquisition of a money transfer service and XRP’s increasing use for cheaper remittances in emerging markets demonstrate this adoption. As more entities utilize XRP for liquidity and payments, its status as a leading digital asset will solidify.
With a large circulating supply, XRP can handle massive transaction volumes without illiquidity. The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and XRP is well positioned to emerge as an enterprise-grade asset especially for financial transactions. For investors, getting onboard this growing use case early could provide substantial long-term upside.
Dogecoin stands out from other cryptocurrencies because of its branding and approachability as the original “fun and friendly” internet money. The Doge meme makes it more accessible to the mainstream public versus other cryptos with obscure names or technical focus.
This friendliness has translated to fast adoption and community growth, with Dogecoin boasting over 4 million followers across social media. The large passionate community gives Dogecoin strength and viral potential that many coins lack.
A major recent development was Elon Musk’s endorsement of Dogecoin and self-proclaimed status as the “Dogefather.” Musk has an unparalleled influence in the crypto space and frequently promotes Dogecoin to his millions of followers. This high-profile celebrity backing sets Dogecoin apart.
Unlike Bitcoin which has a hard cap of 21 million coins, Dogecoin’s supply increases 5 billion coins per year. This makes it better suited as a transactional currency because more supply prevents deflationary spirals as demand rises. The inflationary dynamic encourages spending versus just HODLing the coin.
For investors, Dogecoin offers asymmetric upside because of its extremely low price compared to other major cryptos. Despite its beginnings as a joke, Dogecoin’s brand appeal, passionate community, influential backers, and transactional use case give it a unique advantage that should not be underestimated going forward.
BAD IDEA combines three highly promising technologies – AI, blockchain, and DAOs – into one ambitious experiment. It is unique in letting decentralized AI agents participate equally in governance and decision-making. If successful, this could pioneer a new model for blockchain projects.
Allowing AI agents to have voting rights and manage treasury funds autonomously is innovative. The agents can dynamically adjust the tokenomics and monetary policy based on data versus being locked into a rigid set of rules. This gives BAD IDEA the flexibility to optimize sustainability.
The project produces thought-provoking content on integrating AI into blockchain and Web3. This demonstrates real-world applications versus being just a speculative asset. BAD IDEA aims to address complex issues like climate change through decentralized collaboration.
Although named tongue-in-cheek, BAD IDEA is seriously researching the possibilities of AI-powered governance. The token distribution allocates funds for different development branches to incentivize continuous innovation.
With AI playing an increasing role across industries, BAD IDEA is getting ahead of the curve by researching how to harmonize AI with human governance. The project welcomes community feedback and participation, creating a collaborative environment.
For investors, BAD IDEA offers exposure to a potentially game-changing decentralized governance model. The project’s growth is connected directly to real R&D versus hype, giving it fundamental substance.
The cryptocurrency market is always evolving with new innovative projects and economic cycles. While prices have declined in 2022 from the highs, this bear period provides the perfect chance to research and invest in projects with strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential. The five cryptocurrencies discussed in this article – Crypton, AQLA, XRP, Dogecoin, and BAD IDEA Token – are leaders in their respective categories and have major developments on the horizon.
Whether it is the privacy and security of Crypton fueling Utopia, the carbon offset potential of AQLA, the speed and scalability of XRP for payments, the mainstream brand appeal of Dogecoin, or the cutting-edge governance experiment of the BAD IDEA Token – each cryptocurrency offers investors an intriguing asymmetric opportunity. The markets may be driven by fear and uncertainty now, but the future remains bright for blockchain technology. Maintaining a long-term horizon and accumulating promising crypto assets during bear markets has proven to be a winning strategy throughout the history of this nascent asset class.

ThorChain Hits Record-Setting $355 Million Trading Volume in a Day;"ThorChain, a decentralized liquidity protocol, reported a record-breaking transaction volume on Oct. 5, with the number surging to $355 million in a single day, marking an all-time high.
This noteworthy event is part of a larger trend as the cumulative transaction volume over the past five days has surpassed the $1 billion mark.
According to the analysis, the surge in transaction volume coincided with the rise in swap counts associated with the network. On Oct. 5, when the transaction volume was close to $355 million, the count of swaps related to the network was 115,630.
This was an upward surge compared to the preceding day, when the swap count was 61,877, and the total volume was merely $170.8 million.
The daily change in transaction volume from Oct. 4 to Oct. 5 was a massive 107.6% increase.
A look at the charts indicates an upward trajectory in the transaction volumes since Sept. 29. While the network reported just about $34.45 million as total volume on Sept. 29, the value increased to $60.14 million the next day and $166.4 by Oct. 1.
Later, on Oct. 2, the total transaction volume made a new high of $197.33 million before minor plunges were noted at $173.84 million and $170.84 million between Oct. 3 and 4, respectively. Between Oct. 1 and 5, the cumulative transaction volume was $1.063 billion.
As the transaction volumes seemingly surged, so did the earnings volume associated with the network. On Oct. 4, the liquidity earning was about $109K, and the bond earning stood at $66.7K, a major decline from the highs recorded on Oct. 2. However, on Oct. 5, the liquidity and bond earnings stood at $164.35K and $101.96K, respectively.
As per analysts, the sudden volume surge can be linked to increased hacking activities recently, especially with cross-chain BTC transactions being the main contributor to the massive volume surge.
To address these adverse events, reports indicate that ThorSwap, a product of ThorChain, has paused the platform, shifting into maintenance mode.
When speaking of the developments, ThorSwap developer tweeted;
“Yesterday, following a careful evaluation of the situation and consultation with advisors, legal counsel, and law enforcement, the decision was made to temporarily transition the THORSwap interface into maintenance mode. This action was taken to swiftly curtail any further potential illicit activity.”
Fellow THORChads,
A pressing and persistent concern has recently come to light: the potential movement of illicit funds through THORChain and, specifically, THORSwap. Such activities have no place on the THORSwap platform, and THORSwap stands firmly against any and all criminal…
— THORSwap  #BetterThanCEX (@THORSwap) October 6, 2023

The tweet noted that ThorSwap will remain in this mode till the developers find a more permanent solution to implement and bolster the platform’s continued security and integrity.
The native token of the ThorChain network, Rune, has been trading in the red for most of the past 24 hours. Starting the day at 2.048, the token surged to $2.1 before plunging to a low of about $1.93. Reports indicate that the token has lost about 2,51% in value in the 24 hours from October 5 till the reporting time.
However, the story is quite different in the past seven days, with Rune trading in the green. Starting at $1.92 on Sept. 29, Rune surged to a high of $2.23 on Oct. 2 before falling to a low of $1.88 on Oct. 4.
The charts suggest that the assets have mainly shown a sideways price action, especially in the past five days. However, in the past week, Rune has gained about 3.02% in value.

‘Trading Through Gamification Can Represent the Future’ Says Banksters’ Alexandru Carbunariu;"While centralized exchanges (cexs) are instrumental in helping new users grasp all things crypto, they nevertheless do not go “the extra mile in educating their audience properly,” Alexandru Carbunariu, the CMO at the edutech simulator Banksters, has asserted. According to Carbunariu, a Web3 advisor, properly educating newbies includes making the experience more interactive and fun. He added that Web3 platforms should take a leaf out of their Web2 counterparts’ playbook.
Expanding on the argument that education should be more fun, the CMO said he concurred with those who believe gamification to be the right way of encouraging more positive trading behavior. However, Carbunariu told Bitcoin.com News that while “trading through gamification may represent the future,” many of the current Web3 games may “have taken a wrong turn.”
When asked for his thoughts on the so-called trade-to-win strategy, the Banksters CMO insisted that such a model is better than play-to-earn (P2E) models because it engenders confidence. He suggested that such a model can be ideal for newcomers. Meanwhile, in written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, Carbunariu also articulated why competition is necessary for Web3 platforms looking to get communities attached to their respective products.
Below are Alexandru Carbunariu‘s responses to all questions sent.
Bitcoin.com News (BCN): Centralized exchanges (cexs) are one of the gateways to all things crypto for new users and most of them have taken on the job of educating newcomers. In your opinion, what can they do better or differently to bring in more Web2 users via education?
Alexandru Carbunariu (AC): Speaking from experience, centralized exchanges don’t take the extra mile in educating their audience properly. A lot more things should be done in terms of education, to make it more fun, more rewarding as well as more interactive. We should check what Web2 asset platforms do and get inspired by their work. We rarely see that in Web3. However, we believe that with new regulations, specific training models will come up.
What needs to be done in order to attract Web2 users:
Create interactive training that will provide incentives (like we have seen Revolut doing).
Use normal KOLs [key opinion leaders] to present their products in a transparent [way] but also using normal non-technical language.
Try to introduce academy programs, where normal users can attend, therefore the knowledge will be much higher. Provide transparency when involving risks. Introduce alerts when the user is lost in the complex UX / UI of the platform.
BCN: Do you believe gamification is the right approach to encouraging positive crypto trading behavior with long-term benefits?
AC: Of course. Creating a more fun environment can be relaxing for the user, and if you don’t mix that with financial loss, it’s actually perfect. We are one of the first to build this type of concept. Our A/B tests, focus groups as well user validation were high, meaning that we were on the right track.
I believe that the Web3 games have taken a wrong turn, and the project owners have lost focus. Web3 should be the gateway to the future and it should provide new ways, apart from the traditional ones, in order to onboard as many users.
Trading through gamification can represent the future. First users need to understand it, then they will trade or invest with caution. If their first experience provides them with losses, then they are unlikely to come back. This is why Banksters has stepped in and is helping them to understand more about crypto, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and trading.

BCN: Can you describe what the trade-to-win model is all about and how this differs from play-to-earn?
AC: In the past 2-3 years we have seen the “P2E” as well as the “P&E” types. One thing they have in common is the fact that they have not identified a balance that will give them a much-needed token stability.
Our Trade2Win model lets the user:
First test the product
Learn about the product
Play around with it
And become a winner
This is the model that provides more confidence, and the rewards will come only at the end, meaning if you are a winner then the rewards will be won. This is a more or less “shadow” plan from the trading world, where you need to practice, learn, trade and then gain profits.
BCN: Trading is an umbrella term that encompasses various strategies based on an individual’s mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors. How does your platform help users figure out an optimal strategy for them through low-risk education?
AC: This is a very good question. To give a more of a straight answer: Yes and No. Basically, we can cover this through our so-called “Abilities” which can be compared with “Superpowers” a hero avatar has in the Web2 games. Abilities actually “copy” what is happening on the real market. There are abilities like:
Elon Musk Tweet
Vitalik’s Support
CZ’s Effect
Market Squeeze
Pump and Dump
Hype
Insider Trade
These are real-life trading events, and in many cases, traders or users don’t understand them. What Banksters did was to analyze all of the historical pricing for these events, develop a price algorithm then infuse them into these Abilities.
Now the user will understand what happens to their portfolio and how it will react when these Abilities are used. This actually provides no risk for the user as well as covers a new mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors.
BCN: Whether it’s crypto trading or something else, competition is often an integral part of that. How is Banksters encouraging competition among users?
AC: They are highly competitive! We often have tournaments and live streams which reward users with real USDT. It drives them to use the product and makes them happy with both the game but also the environment.
We strongly believe that competitions, challenges, tournaments and livestreams definitely help the community being attached to the product, while the team can gather transparent and vital feedback.
BCN: When discussing factors holding back large-scale adoption of crypto, lack of education and intuitive user interface (UI) often get the most attention. However, could it be that we have not had mass adoption because the crypto ecosystem is still struggling to find the product-market fit?
AC: Another good question. The answer is pretty simple. It’s about money. However, it’s more than that. For example:
Users:
A lot of people have lost their hard-earned money during the bear market while listening to the unprepared and uneducated key opinion leaders (KOLs) who often accept to promote projects with no filters.
Project Owners:
If one puts two years and $10,000 in the right way, they could raise between $500,000 and a million dollars while having absolutely no experience in blockchain tech, development, management, marketing, or product growth. This, however, has changed and now a lot of Web2 specialists are entering the Web3 space and I believe the standard will go just higher.
Centralized Exchanges:
Providing crazy leverages, with no education, with no warning, and to top all that with FTX keeping their crypto wallet keys in a Google form.
At the end of the day, human nature had to kick in, meaning something terrible had to happen in order for something to be changed.
I think Web3 has gone through a reset in the past 2-3 years, and now, finally, we can see some highly professional projects with funding resources delivering innovative products. Such projects have higher odds of finding product-market fit and accelerating adoption.

While centralized exchanges (cexs) are instrumental in helping new users grasp all things crypto, they nevertheless do not go “the extra mile in educating their audience properly,” Alexandru Carbunariu, the CMO at the edutech simulator Banksters, has asserted. According to Carbunariu, a Web3 advisor, properly educating newbies includes making the experience more interactive and fun. He added that Web3 platforms should take a leaf out of their Web2 counterparts’ playbook.
Expanding on the argument that education should be more fun, the CMO said he concurred with those who believe gamification to be the right way of encouraging more positive trading behavior. However, Carbunariu told Bitcoin.com News that while “trading through gamification may represent the future,” many of the current Web3 games may “have taken a wrong turn.”
When asked for his thoughts on the so-called trade-to-win strategy, the Banksters CMO insisted that such a model is better than play-to-earn (P2E) models because it engenders confidence. He suggested that such a model can be ideal for newcomers. Meanwhile, in written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, Carbunariu also articulated why competition is necessary for Web3 platforms looking to get communities attached to their respective products.
Below are Alexandru Carbunariu‘s responses to all questions sent.
Bitcoin.com News (BCN): Centralized exchanges (cexs) are one of the gateways to all things crypto for new users and most of them have taken on the job of educating newcomers. In your opinion, what can they do better or differently to bring in more Web2 users via education?
Alexandru Carbunariu (AC): Speaking from experience, centralized exchanges don’t take the extra mile in educating their audience properly. A lot more things should be done in terms of education, to make it more fun, more rewarding as well as more interactive. We should check what Web2 asset platforms do and get inspired by their work. We rarely see that in Web3. However, we believe that with new regulations, specific training models will come up.
What needs to be done in order to attract Web2 users:
Create interactive training that will provide incentives (like we have seen Revolut doing).
Use normal KOLs [key opinion leaders] to present their products in a transparent [way] but also using normal non-technical language.
Try to introduce academy programs, where normal users can attend, therefore the knowledge will be much higher. Provide transparency when involving risks. Introduce alerts when the user is lost in the complex UX / UI of the platform.
BCN: Do you believe gamification is the right approach to encouraging positive crypto trading behavior with long-term benefits?

Bitcoin And Crypto Under The Lens As Bond Market Recalls 2008 Crash;"As the global financial landscape witnesses a seismic shift, reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble burst, alarm bells are ringing in the bond market, alerting the Bitcoin and crypto market as well.
Renowned Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Genevieve Roch-Decter, highlighted the striking parallels in a recent tweet, stating, “I can’t believe I am saying this but the slump in 10-year and 30-year bonds is approaching the epic drops we saw in stocks during the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble bust.”
Bloomberg Surveillance’s Lisa Abramowicz reinforces this grim narrative, pointing out that “bonds maturing in 10 years or more have slumped 46% since peaking in March 2020, just shy of the 49% plunge in US stocks in the aftermath of the dot-com bust. The route in 30-year bonds has been even worse, tumbling 53%.”
Onramp, a Bitcoin asset management platform, adds further context by emphasizing the historic nature of the trend. This decline, particularly in bonds with maturities exceeding a decade, harkens back to market downturns like the dot-com bubble collapse. The Federal Reserve’s resolute stance on inflation and a fragile fiscal environment have disrupted the traditional appeal of long-maturity debt, raising questions about the possibility of a debt spiral.
The situation is further complicated by the behavior of the yield curve. Historically, an inverted yield curve has foreshadowed recessions. However, the recent correction has seen a rare “bear steepener,” marked by rising long-term yields. This phenomenon, seen in the past before recessions, raises concerns of an impending economic downturn.
“While some question the yield curve’s reliability as a recession indicator, the current bear steepening suggests that an economic downturn could be imminent. This is particularly concerning given the Fed’s ongoing commitment to restrictive monetary policy, making the situation ripe for potential market volatility and economic uncertainty, “ Dylan LeClair from Onramp notes.
Meanwhile, Barclays’ analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha suggests that only a stock market crash could halt the bond market’s decline. Unlike previous cycles, traditional bond backstops are dwindling, with the Fed shifting from a net buyer to a net seller, and foreign institutional buying slowing.
This highlights the stark disconnect between equity valuations and long-end bond rates, with stocks having significant room for devaluation before bonds stabilize. And if stocks crash, Bitcoin and crypto could be just as affected.
The turmoil in the bond market has far-reaching implications, including its impact on Bitcoin and crypto. Remarkably, the crypto market has never experienced such a situation, but there are general observations of how risk assets have reacted in such environments in the past.
First, rising treasury yields make risk-free returns more attractive, potentially prompting some investors to reallocate capital from risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto to treasury bills. This shift could decrease demand, putting downward pressure on their prices.
Moreover, a sharp rise in 10-year Treasury yields can signal a tighter monetary policy, weighing on risk assets. Higher yields also mean higher borrowing costs, which can impact crypto. When interest rates rise, non-interest-bearing assets like Bitcoin may seem less attractive compared to yield-bearing assets.
A significant increase in Treasury yields can also lead to reduced liquidity in other financial markets, such as the Bitcoin and crypto space. Institutional investors facing liquidity constraints may liquidate more liquid assets like BTC and altcoins causing potential price declines.
Lastly, sharp yield increases can create volatility across various asset classes as investors seek to reduce risk or cover losses elsewhere. Bitcoin and crypto are highly influenced by market sentiment and speculative behavior. The market’s interpretation of rising yields can sway investor behavior, impacting crypto prices.
Accordingly, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, recently predicted:
The 10YR is up another 10% since! […] The Fed wants more unemployment. The job market is still too strong. They’ve raised the expected 2024 rates as a result and the 10YR has broken out to new decade highs. As long as the 10YR is breaking upwards like this, risk assets are going to see further headwinds.
At press time, BTC traded at $27,576.

Crypto: 50% Users Invest To Improve Living Standards;"The crypto industry has experienced substantial expansion over the years, characterized by significant increases in both value and widespread adoption. What was once primarily associated with the dark web has transformed into a sector that is increasingly embraced by individuals worldwide. This transformation underscores the fact that crypto investments have transcended mere speculation for a significant portion of the population.
A recent survey conducted by Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, and published on Oct. 5, 2023, provides valuable insights into how digital assets are now instrumental in elevating living standards. These assets have been accomplishing various financial objectives for users around the world.
About half of crypto users, or around 50%, are directing their investments with the aim of enhancing their everyday living conditions. The survey’s findings indicate that in countries such as South Korea, Canada, and Turkey, 46%, 44%, and 41% of respondents, respectively, have identified this as their foremost financial goal when engaging in digital asset investments.
Moreover, the survey reveals that approximately 36% of participants from Malaysia and Taiwan place a higher priority on improving their family’s overall quality of life. This was when compared to other financial aspirations.
The extensive survey collected information during the period spanning from May to August. It included participation from more than 1,500 individuals representing 20 countries across Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, the United States, and Canada. 
Notably, the survey also illuminated diverse motivations among female crypto investors in different nations. For instance, in the United States and Turkey, around 27% of female crypto investors have their investment in crypto. It is mostly driven by the desire to finance their children’s education. In contrast, this particular goal was less prevalent in South Korea and Japan. Only 5% of female investors expressed the same aspiration.

In terms of Chinese involvement, the survey provided insights into the extent of engagement among crypto users in China. Despite the prohibition on crypto trading within the country, the survey findings suggest that Chinese citizens are actively in the crypto market.
A significant 18% of survey respondents from China stated that they had invested amounts ranging from $50,000 to $100,000. Amidst this, an additional 19% had committed investments between $100,000 and $500,000. It’s worth noting that Chinese nationals can still possess cryptocurrencies and navigate around the trading ban by using VPNs. Additionally, the ban does not apply to Chinese nationals who reside outside of China.

The year 2022 is destined to be remembered as one of the most challenging periods for the crypto industry. It witnessed a substantial decline, with Bitcoin, in particular, experiencing a loss exceeding 60% of its value. Additionally, the overall market incurred losses of just over $2 trillion during the year. Furthermore, this tumultuous period saw the downfall of several crypto firms. However, FTX was the most disruptive of them all. As Sam Bankman-Fried, the figure behind FTX, faces a jury that will determine his future, there are signs that confidence in the crypto market is gradually being reestablished.
In addition to these developments, Bitcoin [BTC] was observed making strides toward a path of resurgence. At press time, BTC was trading at $27,587.30, approaching the $28,000 mark.

Is JPEX Facing the Same Catastrophe as FTX Exchange? Here’s What Happening;"The post Is JPEX Facing the Same Catastrophe as FTX Exchange? Here’s What Happening appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
In recent events, the JPEX virtual asset trading platform(VATPs)in Hong Kong has come under scrutiny for its suspected involvement in a major fraud case. This development has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the current regulatory framework governing cryptocurrencies. Xu Zhengyu, a prominent financial commentator, has emphasized the urgent need for more robust oversight in the industry. This article delves into the JPEX scandal and the pressing demand for a comprehensive regulatory system for cryptocurrencies.
Hui Ching-yu, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury expressed his concerns during an investment committee interview program. He underscored that the JPEX scandal highlights the pressing need for regulatory supervision in the virtual asset sector. Furthermore, he pointed out a significant regulatory gap in Hong Kong — the absence of a stablecoin framework.
Xu Zhengyu, speaking in a live online program of the Investment and Financial Education Committee, shed light on the high risks associated with unregulated virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms often lack transparency and may operate without stability or reliability. In the event of disputes or platform failures, investors have limited avenues for recourse, potentially resulting in substantial financial losses. Notable incidents, like FTX’s collapse overseas and the recent JPEX case in Hong Kong, serve as stark reminders of these risks.
Many virtual asset trading platforms have historically relied on stablecoins like USDT as trading mediums. Xu Zhengyu emphasized the necessity for these coins to maintain value stability by being backed by US dollars or gold. However, past instances have demonstrated that stablecoins can experience significant price volatility or collapse. Xu stressed that the management of reserves by stablecoin issuers directly impacts price stability and investors’ ability to redeem fiat currencies. Given these challenges, Hong Kong has refrained from permitting retail trading in stablecoins until comprehensive regulations are in place.
To safeguard investor interests and prevent conflicts of interest, Huang Lexin, Director of the Licensing Section and Head of the Financial Technology Group of the Intermediary Department of the SFC, outlined certain restrictions for licensed virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms are prohibited from offering various investment products, including periodic “pledges,” interest collection services, deposits, and derivatives transactions.
Huang Lexin also noted that SFC-licensed virtual asset trading platforms are limited to facilitating the purchase and sale of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for retail investors. Any introduction of new currencies on these platforms must adhere to stringent reporting requirements and obtain approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission before becoming available for trading.

Bitcoin and altcoins pushing higher;"Friday has dawned brightly for the crypto sector and a push to the upside is taking place.
If stock markets fall, then this is certainly transferred to the crypto market, and being high risk assets, they are likely to fall hard. However, there are still fluctuations in markets, and they go up as well as down.
After five days of sideways action Bitcoin is rising once again.
Bitcoin found support towards the end of September at the $26,000 level and has been steadily trending upwards ever since. At time of going to press bitcoin is once more at the $27,600 resistance level, and finally taking this out and flipping it into support would be an important step in bitcoin’s climb higher.
Of course, there is still the thorny issue of the 200-week moving average just above, which previously stopped bitcoin in its tracks at $28,000. However, the trend is still up, and if bitcoin keeps knocking at this level it is likely to break through eventually.
If the Alpha beast of the crypto jungle rises then the altcoins will normally follow. Ethereum is having a strong day so far, and is currently butting up against resistance at $1,630. However, it does appear to be breaking the downwards trend from October 1, so look to $ETH to perhaps also break resistance.
Solana is having an even better day thus far. 3% up currently, $SOL is heading back to $24 at a fast rate of knots. The Solana community has its Breakpoint 2023 Conference coming up at the end of the month, and this perhaps why $SOL is moving strongly up again.
A bullish flag has been forming since the beginning of October, and $SOL looks to be breaking out. A measured move for the breakout would take the $SOL price to $29, flipping the resistance at $26 into support. 
Render ($RNDR) is another altcoin riding high. Up 1.75% on the day, $RNDR is battling resistance at $1.75. Should it overcome this, the next resistance at $1.80 awaits, with the 200-week moving average just above.
Render’s founder, Jules Urbach, is speaking at the Solana Breakpoint Conference. What he has to say is likely to be very interesting, although a ‘sell-the-news’ reaction on the $RNDR price may also be likely.

If stock markets fall, then this is certainly transferred to the crypto market, and being high risk assets, they are likely to fall hard. However, there are still fluctuations in markets, and they go up as well as down.
After five days of sideways action Bitcoin is rising once again.
Bitcoin found support towards the end of September at the $26,000 level and has been steadily trending upwards ever since. At time of going to press bitcoin is once more at the $27,600 resistance level, and finally taking this out and flipping it into support would be an important step in bitcoin’s climb higher.
Of course, there is still the thorny issue of the 200-week moving average just above, which previously stopped bitcoin in its tracks at $28,000. However, the trend is still up, and if bitcoin keeps knocking at this level it is likely to break through eventually.
If the Alpha beast of the crypto jungle rises then the altcoins will normally follow. Ethereum is having a strong day so far, and is currently butting up against resistance at $1,630. However, it does appear to be breaking the downwards trend from October 1, so look to $ETH to perhaps also break resistance.
Solana is having an even better day thus far. 3% up currently, $SOL is heading back to $24 at a fast rate of knots. The Solana community has its Breakpoint 2023 Conference coming up at the end of the month, and this perhaps why $SOL is moving strongly up again.
A bullish flag has been forming since the beginning of October, and $SOL looks to be breaking out. A measured move for the breakout would take the $SOL price to $29, flipping the resistance at $26 into support. 
Render ($RNDR) is another altcoin riding high. Up 1.75% on the day, $RNDR is battling resistance at $1.75. Should it overcome this, the next resistance at $1.80 awaits, with the 200-week moving average just above.
Render’s founder, Jules Urbach, is speaking at the Solana Breakpoint Conference. What he has to say is likely to be very interesting, although a ‘sell-the-news’ reaction on the $RNDR price may also be likely.

BCH Price Analysis: Will This Pattern Push BCH TO $300?;"The post BCH Price Analysis: Will This Pattern Push BCH TO $300? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
As the overall market recovers, with Bitcoin taking a bullish step in October, the altcoins are on a positive track. Even though the BCH price breached the $250 mark in the first two days of October with a remarkable growth of 10%. 
Despite this, the overhead supply pressure at the psychological level caused a sharp correction in the Bitcoin Cash market price. However, with the sentiment turning bullish, expectations for the Bitcoin Cash price prediction in 2023 remain optimistic.
Although there has been a recent correction, the overall trend of the BCH price suggests a bullish revival and a rise to higher levels. The bullish reversal from the buyers’ region at $180 and the 200-day EMA provided the Bitcoin Cash price with a springboard to regain momentum.
Moreover, the recent sharp correction to the $230 mark increases the chances of an inverted head and shoulder. Currently, the altcoin price trades at $231.50, with multiple Doji candle formations at the $230 support level.
With the underlying bullish sentiments averting downfall, the chances of BCH price taking a reversal to $250 are increasing. This recovery phase will complete the bullish pattern with the neckline at $250.
Technical indicators:
Coming to the technical indicators, the Directional Movement Index sustains a bullish point of view. 
DMI indicator: The ADX line (black line) has shot up in recent times, indicating a strong momentum. Additionally, the DI line remains bullish, signaling further recovery.
EMA: The 50 and 200-day EMA maintain a positive alignment and continue to rise higher, which certifies the uptrend in motion. 
With plans for a bullish reversal from $230, the inverted head and shoulder pattern presents a trend reversal opportunity in BCH price. However, if the price struggles to overcome the $250 mark, it may lead to a potential pullback to $228. 
However, the inverted head and shoulder breakout will increase the likelihood of Bitcoin Cash price exceeding $300. With the potential to continue the rally above, the reversal from $250 or the $250 breakout will prove a crucial entry point for sideline buyers. 
Considering the price breaks below the $228 post, the downtrend will plunge the prices to $200.

Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the 2023 ;"The post Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the 2023  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
After the crypto market euphoria of 2021, prices have cooled considerably in 2022 and early 2023. Bitcoin, Ethereum and most major cryptocurrencies are down 60-80% from their all-time highs. This bear market provides the perfect chance to accumulate top cryptocurrencies at discounted prices before the next major bull market.
Just as the stock market moves through periods of boom and bust, so too does the nascent cryptocurrency market follow predictable cycles. We have already witnessed this pattern with a bull run in 2017 giving way to a multi-year bear trend, before the huge surge in 2020-21. Now, as crypto winter sets in, savvy investors know that the best time to buy is when there is “blood in the streets.”
History has shown patience pays off handsomely for those accumulating top-tier crypto assets when prices are depressed. When the next wave of institutional and retail adoption comes, supply squeezes for scarce assets like Bitcoin will drive prices higher. Leading smart contract platforms like Ethereum will also benefit from further mainstream utilization in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, metaverse and Web3 applications.
This article highlights 5 of the most promising cryptocurrencies to add to your portfolio during the 2023 bear market. With fundamental development continuing apace despite price declines, our recommended crypto assets are prime to generate tremendous upside for investors with long time horizons. Periods of fear and uncertainty often provide the greatest opportunities – the forward-thinking will stake their claims now and reap substantial rewards during the next bull cycle.
Crypton‘s association with the Utopia P2P ecosystem makes it uniquely positioned for long-term success. Utopia is a decentralized network built for private, secure communication and data transmission. All financial transactions within the ecosystem are conducted using Crypton.
As a privacy coin, Crypton offers complete anonymity and untraceability for transactions. This is accomplished through cryptographic signing and encryption to protect against fraud and ensure the security of funds. For cryptocurrency investors and users concerned about privacy, Crypton checks all the right boxes.
The instant, irreversible settlement of Crypton transactions also makes it attractive as a payment method. Merchants and vendors can benefit from fast transaction times without the risk of reversal. These are advantages Crypton has over traditional fiat currency payment rails.
Crypton can also be earned through mining to support the Utopia network infrastructure. This promotes greater decentralization and alignment of incentives. Miners earn newly minted Crypton as well as interest on their balances, providing recurring yield.
Importantly, Crypton has a real-world use case powering the Utopia ecosystem. It is not just an abstract investment asset. Adoption of Utopia for private communication and transactions will drive Demand for Crypton over time.
For cryptocurrency investors interested in privacy, security, speed, and an associated ecosystem, Crypton checks all the boxes. As Utopia continues growing, it represents an asymmetric opportunity compared to other crypto assets. For these reasons, Crypton is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to invest in for the long-term.
AQLA is designed to capitalize on the massive and rapidly growing carbon offset market, estimated to reach $250 billion by Morgan Stanley. With global carbon emissions continuing to rise, the need for carbon offsets and mitigation projects will only increase in the coming years.
AQLA aims to bring credibility and transparency to carbon offsets by recording them on its blockchain platform. This provides tamper-proof verification of the offsets and allows them to be tokenized and traded efficiently. The blockchain approach solves key issues like double-counting and verification that have hindered the offset market’s growth.
The project has a global vision of promoting awareness and enabling businesses to adopt carbon neutral practices. As climate change concerns grow, this first-mover advantage in the blockchain carbon space gives AQLA huge room for adoption. Its standards and methodologies align with major international climate agreements as well.
Additionally, AQLA is actively developing real-world use cases in voluntary carbon markets to back green technologies. This creates utility and demand for the AQLA token beyond just speculation. The wider applicability in ESG solutions also expands its total addressable market.
With environmental sustainability becoming increasingly important worldwide, AQLA is a purpose-built solution catering to massive needs. Its blockchain platform and token allow climate action to scale exponentially. For investors, getting in early with AQLA provides exposure to a rapidly expanding space. The project’s sustainability focus also gives it an ethical edge over other crypto offerings.
XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, an open-source, decentralized blockchain created by Ripple Labs. It is designed to facilitate fast, affordable global financial transactions.
A key advantage of XRP is its speed – transactions settle in 3-5 seconds. This makes it well-suited for cross-border payments and currency exchanges where slow processing times currently cause delays and high costs. Financial institutions can save significant time and money by using XRP.
Additionally, XRP has very low transaction fees at a fraction of a penny per transaction. This scalable cost structure allows XRP to handle high transaction volumes without becoming prohibitively expensive.
Ripple is aggressively pushing adoption of XRP by partnering with major financial institutions and money transfer services globally. These partnerships are critical for giving XRP real-world utility and payment volume to drive demand.
Developments like Ripple’s acquisition of a money transfer service and XRP’s increasing use for cheaper remittances in emerging markets demonstrate this adoption. As more entities utilize XRP for liquidity and payments, its status as a leading digital asset will solidify.
With a large circulating supply, XRP can handle massive transaction volumes without illiquidity. The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and XRP is well positioned to emerge as an enterprise-grade asset especially for financial transactions. For investors, getting onboard this growing use case early could provide substantial long-term upside.
Dogecoin stands out from other cryptocurrencies because of its branding and approachability as the original “fun and friendly” internet money. The Doge meme makes it more accessible to the mainstream public versus other cryptos with obscure names or technical focus.
This friendliness has translated to fast adoption and community growth, with Dogecoin boasting over 4 million followers across social media. The large passionate community gives Dogecoin strength and viral potential that many coins lack.
A major recent development was Elon Musk’s endorsement of Dogecoin and self-proclaimed status as the “Dogefather.” Musk has an unparalleled influence in the crypto space and frequently promotes Dogecoin to his millions of followers. This high-profile celebrity backing sets Dogecoin apart.
Unlike Bitcoin which has a hard cap of 21 million coins, Dogecoin’s supply increases 5 billion coins per year. This makes it better suited as a transactional currency because more supply prevents deflationary spirals as demand rises. The inflationary dynamic encourages spending versus just HODLing the coin.
For investors, Dogecoin offers asymmetric upside because of its extremely low price compared to other major cryptos. Despite its beginnings as a joke, Dogecoin’s brand appeal, passionate community, influential backers, and transactional use case give it a unique advantage that should not be underestimated going forward.
BAD IDEA combines three highly promising technologies – AI, blockchain, and DAOs – into one ambitious experiment. It is unique in letting decentralized AI agents participate equally in governance and decision-making. If successful, this could pioneer a new model for blockchain projects.
Allowing AI agents to have voting rights and manage treasury funds autonomously is innovative. The agents can dynamically adjust the tokenomics and monetary policy based on data versus being locked into a rigid set of rules. This gives BAD IDEA the flexibility to optimize sustainability.
The project produces thought-provoking content on integrating AI into blockchain and Web3. This demonstrates real-world applications versus being just a speculative asset. BAD IDEA aims to address complex issues like climate change through decentralized collaboration.
Although named tongue-in-cheek, BAD IDEA is seriously researching the possibilities of AI-powered governance. The token distribution allocates funds for different development branches to incentivize continuous innovation.
With AI playing an increasing role across industries, BAD IDEA is getting ahead of the curve by researching how to harmonize AI with human governance. The project welcomes community feedback and participation, creating a collaborative environment.
For investors, BAD IDEA offers exposure to a potentially game-changing decentralized governance model. The project’s growth is connected directly to real R&D versus hype, giving it fundamental substance.
The cryptocurrency market is always evolving with new innovative projects and economic cycles. While prices have declined in 2022 from the highs, this bear period provides the perfect chance to research and invest in projects with strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential. The five cryptocurrencies discussed in this article – Crypton, AQLA, XRP, Dogecoin, and BAD IDEA Token – are leaders in their respective categories and have major developments on the horizon.
Whether it is the privacy and security of Crypton fueling Utopia, the carbon offset potential of AQLA, the speed and scalability of XRP for payments, the mainstream brand appeal of Dogecoin, or the cutting-edge governance experiment of the BAD IDEA Token – each cryptocurrency offers investors an intriguing asymmetric opportunity. The markets may be driven by fear and uncertainty now, but the future remains bright for blockchain technology. Maintaining a long-term horizon and accumulating promising crypto assets during bear markets has proven to be a winning strategy throughout the history of this nascent asset class.

ThorChain Hits Record-Setting $355 Million Trading Volume in a Day;"ThorChain, a decentralized liquidity protocol, reported a record-breaking transaction volume on Oct. 5, with the number surging to $355 million in a single day, marking an all-time high.
This noteworthy event is part of a larger trend as the cumulative transaction volume over the past five days has surpassed the $1 billion mark.
According to the analysis, the surge in transaction volume coincided with the rise in swap counts associated with the network. On Oct. 5, when the transaction volume was close to $355 million, the count of swaps related to the network was 115,630.
This was an upward surge compared to the preceding day, when the swap count was 61,877, and the total volume was merely $170.8 million.
The daily change in transaction volume from Oct. 4 to Oct. 5 was a massive 107.6% increase.
A look at the charts indicates an upward trajectory in the transaction volumes since Sept. 29. While the network reported just about $34.45 million as total volume on Sept. 29, the value increased to $60.14 million the next day and $166.4 by Oct. 1.
Later, on Oct. 2, the total transaction volume made a new high of $197.33 million before minor plunges were noted at $173.84 million and $170.84 million between Oct. 3 and 4, respectively. Between Oct. 1 and 5, the cumulative transaction volume was $1.063 billion.
As the transaction volumes seemingly surged, so did the earnings volume associated with the network. On Oct. 4, the liquidity earning was about $109K, and the bond earning stood at $66.7K, a major decline from the highs recorded on Oct. 2. However, on Oct. 5, the liquidity and bond earnings stood at $164.35K and $101.96K, respectively.
As per analysts, the sudden volume surge can be linked to increased hacking activities recently, especially with cross-chain BTC transactions being the main contributor to the massive volume surge.
To address these adverse events, reports indicate that ThorSwap, a product of ThorChain, has paused the platform, shifting into maintenance mode.
When speaking of the developments, ThorSwap developer tweeted;
“Yesterday, following a careful evaluation of the situation and consultation with advisors, legal counsel, and law enforcement, the decision was made to temporarily transition the THORSwap interface into maintenance mode. This action was taken to swiftly curtail any further potential illicit activity.”
Fellow THORChads,

The tweet noted that ThorSwap will remain in this mode till the developers find a more permanent solution to implement and bolster the platform’s continued security and integrity.
The native token of the ThorChain network, Rune, has been trading in the red for most of the past 24 hours. Starting the day at 2.048, the token surged to $2.1 before plunging to a low of about $1.93. Reports indicate that the token has lost about 2,51% in value in the 24 hours from October 5 till the reporting time.
However, the story is quite different in the past seven days, with Rune trading in the green. Starting at $1.92 on Sept. 29, Rune surged to a high of $2.23 on Oct. 2 before falling to a low of $1.88 on Oct. 4.
The charts suggest that the assets have mainly shown a sideways price action, especially in the past five days. However, in the past week, Rune has gained about 3.02% in value.

ThorChain, a decentralized liquidity protocol, reported a record-breaking transaction volume on Oct. 5, with the number surging to $355 million in a single day, marking an all-time high.
This noteworthy event is part of a larger trend as the cumulative transaction volume over the past five days has surpassed the $1 billion mark.
According to the analysis, the surge in transaction volume coincided with the rise in swap counts associated with the network. On Oct. 5, when the transaction volume was close to $355 million, the count of swaps related to the network was 115,630.
This was an upward surge compared to the preceding day, when the swap count was 61,877, and the total volume was merely $170.8 million.
The daily change in transaction volume from Oct. 4 to Oct. 5 was a massive 107.6% increase.
A look at the charts indicates an upward trajectory in the transaction volumes since Sept. 29. While the network reported just about $34.45 million as total volume on Sept. 29, the value increased to $60.14 million the next day and $166.4 by Oct. 1.
Later, on Oct. 2, the total transaction volume made a new high of $197.33 million before minor plunges were noted at $173.84 million and $170.84 million between Oct. 3 and 4, respectively. Between Oct. 1 and 5, the cumulative transaction volume was $1.063 billion.
As the transaction volumes seemingly surged, so did the earnings volume associated with the network. On Oct. 4, the liquidity earning was about $109K, and the bond earning stood at $66.7K, a major decline from the highs recorded on Oct. 2. However, on Oct. 5, the liquidity and bond earnings stood at $164.35K and $101.96K, respectively.
As per analysts, the sudden volume surge can be linked to increased hacking activities recently, especially with cross-chain BTC transactions being the main contributor to the massive volume surge.
To address these adverse events, reports indicate that ThorSwap, a product of ThorChain, has paused the platform, shifting into maintenance mode.
When speaking of the developments, ThorSwap developer tweeted;
“Yesterday, following a careful evaluation of the situation and consultation with advisors, legal counsel, and law enforcement, the decision was made to temporarily transition the THORSwap interface into maintenance mode. This action was taken to swiftly curtail any further potential illicit activity.”
Fellow THORChads,
A pressing and persistent concern has recently come to light: the potential movement of illicit funds through THORChain and, specifically, THORSwap. Such activities have no place on the THORSwap platform, and THORSwap stands firmly against any and all criminal…

‘Trading Through Gamification Can Represent the Future’ Says Banksters’ Alexandru Carbunariu;"While centralized exchanges (cexs) are instrumental in helping new users grasp all things crypto, they nevertheless do not go “the extra mile in educating their audience properly,” Alexandru Carbunariu, the CMO at the edutech simulator Banksters, has asserted. According to Carbunariu, a Web3 advisor, properly educating newbies includes making the experience more interactive and fun. He added that Web3 platforms should take a leaf out of their Web2 counterparts’ playbook.
Expanding on the argument that education should be more fun, the CMO said he concurred with those who believe gamification to be the right way of encouraging more positive trading behavior. However, Carbunariu told Bitcoin.com News that while “trading through gamification may represent the future,” many of the current Web3 games may “have taken a wrong turn.”
When asked for his thoughts on the so-called trade-to-win strategy, the Banksters CMO insisted that such a model is better than play-to-earn (P2E) models because it engenders confidence. He suggested that such a model can be ideal for newcomers. Meanwhile, in written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, Carbunariu also articulated why competition is necessary for Web3 platforms looking to get communities attached to their respective products.
Below are Alexandru Carbunariu‘s responses to all questions sent.
Bitcoin.com News (BCN): Centralized exchanges (cexs) are one of the gateways to all things crypto for new users and most of them have taken on the job of educating newcomers. In your opinion, what can they do better or differently to bring in more Web2 users via education?
Alexandru Carbunariu (AC): Speaking from experience, centralized exchanges don’t take the extra mile in educating their audience properly. A lot more things should be done in terms of education, to make it more fun, more rewarding as well as more interactive. We should check what Web2 asset platforms do and get inspired by their work. We rarely see that in Web3. However, we believe that with new regulations, specific training models will come up.
What needs to be done in order to attract Web2 users:
Create interactive training that will provide incentives (like we have seen Revolut doing).
Use normal KOLs [key opinion leaders] to present their products in a transparent [way] but also using normal non-technical language.
Try to introduce academy programs, where normal users can attend, therefore the knowledge will be much higher. Provide transparency when involving risks. Introduce alerts when the user is lost in the complex UX / UI of the platform.
BCN: Do you believe gamification is the right approach to encouraging positive crypto trading behavior with long-term benefits?
AC: Of course. Creating a more fun environment can be relaxing for the user, and if you don’t mix that with financial loss, it’s actually perfect. We are one of the first to build this type of concept. Our A/B tests, focus groups as well user validation were high, meaning that we were on the right track.
I believe that the Web3 games have taken a wrong turn, and the project owners have lost focus. Web3 should be the gateway to the future and it should provide new ways, apart from the traditional ones, in order to onboard as many users.
Trading through gamification can represent the future. First users need to understand it, then they will trade or invest with caution. If their first experience provides them with losses, then they are unlikely to come back. This is why Banksters has stepped in and is helping them to understand more about crypto, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and trading.

BCN: Can you describe what the trade-to-win model is all about and how this differs from play-to-earn?
AC: In the past 2-3 years we have seen the “P2E” as well as the “P&E” types. One thing they have in common is the fact that they have not identified a balance that will give them a much-needed token stability.
Our Trade2Win model lets the user:
First test the product
Learn about the product
Play around with it
And become a winner
This is the model that provides more confidence, and the rewards will come only at the end, meaning if you are a winner then the rewards will be won. This is a more or less “shadow” plan from the trading world, where you need to practice, learn, trade and then gain profits.
BCN: Trading is an umbrella term that encompasses various strategies based on an individual’s mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors. How does your platform help users figure out an optimal strategy for them through low-risk education?
AC: This is a very good question. To give a more of a straight answer: Yes and No. Basically, we can cover this through our so-called “Abilities” which can be compared with “Superpowers” a hero avatar has in the Web2 games. Abilities actually “copy” what is happening on the real market. There are abilities like:
Elon Musk Tweet
Vitalik’s Support
CZ’s Effect
Market Squeeze
Pump and Dump
Hype
Insider Trade
These are real-life trading events, and in many cases, traders or users don’t understand them. What Banksters did was to analyze all of the historical pricing for these events, develop a price algorithm then infuse them into these Abilities.
Now the user will understand what happens to their portfolio and how it will react when these Abilities are used. This actually provides no risk for the user as well as covers a new mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors.
BCN: Whether it’s crypto trading or something else, competition is often an integral part of that. How is Banksters encouraging competition among users?
AC: They are highly competitive! We often have tournaments and live streams which reward users with real USDT. It drives them to use the product and makes them happy with both the game but also the environment.
We strongly believe that competitions, challenges, tournaments and livestreams definitely help the community being attached to the product, while the team can gather transparent and vital feedback.
BCN: When discussing factors holding back large-scale adoption of crypto, lack of education and intuitive user interface (UI) often get the most attention. However, could it be that we have not had mass adoption because the crypto ecosystem is still struggling to find the product-market fit?
AC: Another good question. The answer is pretty simple. It’s about money. However, it’s more than that. For example:
Users:
A lot of people have lost their hard-earned money during the bear market while listening to the unprepared and uneducated key opinion leaders (KOLs) who often accept to promote projects with no filters.
Project Owners:
If one puts two years and $10,000 in the right way, they could raise between $500,000 and a million dollars while having absolutely no experience in blockchain tech, development, management, marketing, or product growth. This, however, has changed and now a lot of Web2 specialists are entering the Web3 space and I believe the standard will go just higher.
Centralized Exchanges:
Providing crazy leverages, with no education, with no warning, and to top all that with FTX keeping their crypto wallet keys in a Google form.
At the end of the day, human nature had to kick in, meaning something terrible had to happen in order for something to be changed.
I think Web3 has gone through a reset in the past 2-3 years, and now, finally, we can see some highly professional projects with funding resources delivering innovative products. Such projects have higher odds of finding product-market fit and accelerating adoption.

Bitcoin And Crypto Under The Lens As Bond Market Recalls 2008 Crash;"As the global financial landscape witnesses a seismic shift, reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble burst, alarm bells are ringing in the bond market, alerting the Bitcoin and crypto market as well.
Renowned Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Genevieve Roch-Decter, highlighted the striking parallels in a recent tweet, stating, “I can’t believe I am saying this but the slump in 10-year and 30-year bonds is approaching the epic drops we saw in stocks during the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble bust.”
Bloomberg Surveillance’s Lisa Abramowicz reinforces this grim narrative, pointing out that “bonds maturing in 10 years or more have slumped 46% since peaking in March 2020, just shy of the 49% plunge in US stocks in the aftermath of the dot-com bust. The route in 30-year bonds has been even worse, tumbling 53%.”
Onramp, a Bitcoin asset management platform, adds further context by emphasizing the historic nature of the trend. This decline, particularly in bonds with maturities exceeding a decade, harkens back to market downturns like the dot-com bubble collapse. The Federal Reserve’s resolute stance on inflation and a fragile fiscal environment have disrupted the traditional appeal of long-maturity debt, raising questions about the possibility of a debt spiral.
The situation is further complicated by the behavior of the yield curve. Historically, an inverted yield curve has foreshadowed recessions. However, the recent correction has seen a rare “bear steepener,” marked by rising long-term yields. This phenomenon, seen in the past before recessions, raises concerns of an impending economic downturn.
“While some question the yield curve’s reliability as a recession indicator, the current bear steepening suggests that an economic downturn could be imminent. This is particularly concerning given the Fed’s ongoing commitment to restrictive monetary policy, making the situation ripe for potential market volatility and economic uncertainty, “ Dylan LeClair from Onramp notes.
Meanwhile, Barclays’ analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha suggests that only a stock market crash could halt the bond market’s decline. Unlike previous cycles, traditional bond backstops are dwindling, with the Fed shifting from a net buyer to a net seller, and foreign institutional buying slowing.
This highlights the stark disconnect between equity valuations and long-end bond rates, with stocks having significant room for devaluation before bonds stabilize. And if stocks crash, Bitcoin and crypto could be just as affected.
The turmoil in the bond market has far-reaching implications, including its impact on Bitcoin and crypto. Remarkably, the crypto market has never experienced such a situation, but there are general observations of how risk assets have reacted in such environments in the past.
First, rising treasury yields make risk-free returns more attractive, potentially prompting some investors to reallocate capital from risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto to treasury bills. This shift could decrease demand, putting downward pressure on their prices.
Moreover, a sharp rise in 10-year Treasury yields can signal a tighter monetary policy, weighing on risk assets. Higher yields also mean higher borrowing costs, which can impact crypto. When interest rates rise, non-interest-bearing assets like Bitcoin may seem less attractive compared to yield-bearing assets.
A significant increase in Treasury yields can also lead to reduced liquidity in other financial markets, such as the Bitcoin and crypto space. Institutional investors facing liquidity constraints may liquidate more liquid assets like BTC and altcoins causing potential price declines.
Lastly, sharp yield increases can create volatility across various asset classes as investors seek to reduce risk or cover losses elsewhere. Bitcoin and crypto are highly influenced by market sentiment and speculative behavior. The market’s interpretation of rising yields can sway investor behavior, impacting crypto prices.
Accordingly, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, recently predicted:
The 10YR is up another 10% since! […] The Fed wants more unemployment. The job market is still too strong. They’ve raised the expected 2024 rates as a result and the 10YR has broken out to new decade highs. As long as the 10YR is breaking upwards like this, risk assets are going to see further headwinds.
At press time, BTC traded at $27,576.

Crypto: 50% Users Invest To Improve Living Standards;"The crypto industry has experienced substantial expansion over the years, characterized by significant increases in both value and widespread adoption. What was once primarily associated with the dark web has transformed into a sector that is increasingly embraced by individuals worldwide. This transformation underscores the fact that crypto investments have transcended mere speculation for a significant portion of the population.
A recent survey conducted by Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, and published on Oct. 5, 2023, provides valuable insights into how digital assets are now instrumental in elevating living standards. These assets have been accomplishing various financial objectives for users around the world.
About half of crypto users, or around 50%, are directing their investments with the aim of enhancing their everyday living conditions. The survey’s findings indicate that in countries such as South Korea, Canada, and Turkey, 46%, 44%, and 41% of respondents, respectively, have identified this as their foremost financial goal when engaging in digital asset investments.
Moreover, the survey reveals that approximately 36% of participants from Malaysia and Taiwan place a higher priority on improving their family’s overall quality of life. This was when compared to other financial aspirations.
The extensive survey collected information during the period spanning from May to August. It included participation from more than 1,500 individuals representing 20 countries across Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, the United States, and Canada. 
Notably, the survey also illuminated diverse motivations among female crypto investors in different nations. For instance, in the United States and Turkey, around 27% of female crypto investors have their investment in crypto. It is mostly driven by the desire to finance their children’s education. In contrast, this particular goal was less prevalent in South Korea and Japan. Only 5% of female investors expressed the same aspiration.

In terms of Chinese involvement, the survey provided insights into the extent of engagement among crypto users in China. Despite the prohibition on crypto trading within the country, the survey findings suggest that Chinese citizens are actively in the crypto market.
A significant 18% of survey respondents from China stated that they had invested amounts ranging from $50,000 to $100,000. Amidst this, an additional 19% had committed investments between $100,000 and $500,000. It’s worth noting that Chinese nationals can still possess cryptocurrencies and navigate around the trading ban by using VPNs. Additionally, the ban does not apply to Chinese nationals who reside outside of China.

The year 2022 is destined to be remembered as one of the most challenging periods for the crypto industry. It witnessed a substantial decline, with Bitcoin, in particular, experiencing a loss exceeding 60% of its value. Additionally, the overall market incurred losses of just over $2 trillion during the year. Furthermore, this tumultuous period saw the downfall of several crypto firms. However, FTX was the most disruptive of them all. As Sam Bankman-Fried, the figure behind FTX, faces a jury that will determine his future, there are signs that confidence in the crypto market is gradually being reestablished.
In addition to these developments, Bitcoin [BTC] was observed making strides toward a path of resurgence. At press time, BTC was trading at $27,587.30, approaching the $28,000 mark.

As Sam Bankman-Fried, the figure behind FTX, faces a jury that will determine his future, there are signs that confidence in the crypto market is gradually being reestablished.
In addition to these developments, Bitcoin [BTC] was observed making strides toward a path of resurgence. At press time, BTC was trading at $27,587.30, approaching the $28,000 mark.

Is JPEX Facing the Same Catastrophe as FTX Exchange? Here’s What Happening;"The post Is JPEX Facing the Same Catastrophe as FTX Exchange? Here’s What Happening appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
In recent events, the JPEX virtual asset trading platform(VATPs)in Hong Kong has come under scrutiny for its suspected involvement in a major fraud case. This development has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the current regulatory framework governing cryptocurrencies. Xu Zhengyu, a prominent financial commentator, has emphasized the urgent need for more robust oversight in the industry. This article delves into the JPEX scandal and the pressing demand for a comprehensive regulatory system for cryptocurrencies.
Hui Ching-yu, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury expressed his concerns during an investment committee interview program. He underscored that the JPEX scandal highlights the pressing need for regulatory supervision in the virtual asset sector. Furthermore, he pointed out a significant regulatory gap in Hong Kong — the absence of a stablecoin framework.
Xu Zhengyu, speaking in a live online program of the Investment and Financial Education Committee, shed light on the high risks associated with unregulated virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms often lack transparency and may operate without stability or reliability. In the event of disputes or platform failures, investors have limited avenues for recourse, potentially resulting in substantial financial losses. Notable incidents, like FTX’s collapse overseas and the recent JPEX case in Hong Kong, serve as stark reminders of these risks.
Many virtual asset trading platforms have historically relied on stablecoins like USDT as trading mediums. Xu Zhengyu emphasized the necessity for these coins to maintain value stability by being backed by US dollars or gold. However, past instances have demonstrated that stablecoins can experience significant price volatility or collapse. Xu stressed that the management of reserves by stablecoin issuers directly impacts price stability and investors’ ability to redeem fiat currencies. Given these challenges, Hong Kong has refrained from permitting retail trading in stablecoins until comprehensive regulations are in place.
To safeguard investor interests and prevent conflicts of interest, Huang Lexin, Director of the Licensing Section and Head of the Financial Technology Group of the Intermediary Department of the SFC, outlined certain restrictions for licensed virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms are prohibited from offering various investment products, including periodic “pledges,” interest collection services, deposits, and derivatives transactions.
Huang Lexin also noted that SFC-licensed virtual asset trading platforms are limited to facilitating the purchase and sale of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for retail investors. Any introduction of new currencies on these platforms must adhere to stringent reporting requirements and obtain approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission before becoming available for trading.

Bitcoin and altcoins pushing higher;"Friday has dawned brightly for the crypto sector and a push to the upside is taking place.
If stock markets fall, then this is certainly transferred to the crypto market, and being high risk assets, they are likely to fall hard. However, there are still fluctuations in markets, and they go up as well as down.
After five days of sideways action Bitcoin is rising once again.
Bitcoin found support towards the end of September at the $26,000 level and has been steadily trending upwards ever since. At time of going to press bitcoin is once more at the $27,600 resistance level, and finally taking this out and flipping it into support would be an important step in bitcoin’s climb higher.
Of course, there is still the thorny issue of the 200-week moving average just above, which previously stopped bitcoin in its tracks at $28,000. However, the trend is still up, and if bitcoin keeps knocking at this level it is likely to break through eventually.
If the Alpha beast of the crypto jungle rises then the altcoins will normally follow. Ethereum is having a strong day so far, and is currently butting up against resistance at $1,630. However, it does appear to be breaking the downwards trend from October 1, so look to $ETH to perhaps also break resistance.
Solana is having an even better day thus far. 3% up currently, $SOL is heading back to $24 at a fast rate of knots. The Solana community has its Breakpoint 2023 Conference coming up at the end of the month, and this perhaps why $SOL is moving strongly up again.
A bullish flag has been forming since the beginning of October, and $SOL looks to be breaking out. A measured move for the breakout would take the $SOL price to $29, flipping the resistance at $26 into support. 
Render ($RNDR) is another altcoin riding high. Up 1.75% on the day, $RNDR is battling resistance at $1.75. Should it overcome this, the next resistance at $1.80 awaits, with the 200-week moving average just above.
Render’s founder, Jules Urbach, is speaking at the Solana Breakpoint Conference. What he has to say is likely to be very interesting, although a ‘sell-the-news’ reaction on the $RNDR price may also be likely.

BCH Price Analysis: Will This Pattern Push BCH TO $300?;"The post BCH Price Analysis: Will This Pattern Push BCH TO $300? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
As the overall market recovers, with Bitcoin taking a bullish step in October, the altcoins are on a positive track. Even though the BCH price breached the $250 mark in the first two days of October with a remarkable growth of 10%. 
Despite this, the overhead supply pressure at the psychological level caused a sharp correction in the Bitcoin Cash market price. However, with the sentiment turning bullish, expectations for the Bitcoin Cash price prediction in 2023 remain optimistic.
Although there has been a recent correction, the overall trend of the BCH price suggests a bullish revival and a rise to higher levels. The bullish reversal from the buyers’ region at $180 and the 200-day EMA provided the Bitcoin Cash price with a springboard to regain momentum.
Moreover, the recent sharp correction to the $230 mark increases the chances of an inverted head and shoulder. Currently, the altcoin price trades at $231.50, with multiple Doji candle formations at the $230 support level.
With the underlying bullish sentiments averting downfall, the chances of BCH price taking a reversal to $250 are increasing. This recovery phase will complete the bullish pattern with the neckline at $250.
Technical indicators:
Coming to the technical indicators, the Directional Movement Index sustains a bullish point of view. 
DMI indicator: The ADX line (black line) has shot up in recent times, indicating a strong momentum. Additionally, the DI line remains bullish, signaling further recovery.
EMA: The 50 and 200-day EMA maintain a positive alignment and continue to rise higher, which certifies the uptrend in motion. 
With plans for a bullish reversal from $230, the inverted head and shoulder pattern presents a trend reversal opportunity in BCH price. However, if the price struggles to overcome the $250 mark, it may lead to a potential pullback to $228. 
However, the inverted head and shoulder breakout will increase the likelihood of Bitcoin Cash price exceeding $300. With the potential to continue the rally above, the reversal from $250 or the $250 breakout will prove a crucial entry point for sideline buyers. 
Considering the price breaks below the $228 post, the downtrend will plunge the prices to $200.

Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the 2023 ;"The post Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the 2023  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
After the crypto market euphoria of 2021, prices have cooled considerably in 2022 and early 2023. Bitcoin, Ethereum and most major cryptocurrencies are down 60-80% from their all-time highs. This bear market provides the perfect chance to accumulate top cryptocurrencies at discounted prices before the next major bull market.
Just as the stock market moves through periods of boom and bust, so too does the nascent cryptocurrency market follow predictable cycles. We have already witnessed this pattern with a bull run in 2017 giving way to a multi-year bear trend, before the huge surge in 2020-21. Now, as crypto winter sets in, savvy investors know that the best time to buy is when there is “blood in the streets.”
History has shown patience pays off handsomely for those accumulating top-tier crypto assets when prices are depressed. When the next wave of institutional and retail adoption comes, supply squeezes for scarce assets like Bitcoin will drive prices higher. Leading smart contract platforms like Ethereum will also benefit from further mainstream utilization in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, metaverse and Web3 applications.
This article highlights 5 of the most promising cryptocurrencies to add to your portfolio during the 2023 bear market. With fundamental development continuing apace despite price declines, our recommended crypto assets are prime to generate tremendous upside for investors with long time horizons. Periods of fear and uncertainty often provide the greatest opportunities – the forward-thinking will stake their claims now and reap substantial rewards during the next bull cycle.
Crypton‘s association with the Utopia P2P ecosystem makes it uniquely positioned for long-term success. Utopia is a decentralized network built for private, secure communication and data transmission. All financial transactions within the ecosystem are conducted using Crypton.
As a privacy coin, Crypton offers complete anonymity and untraceability for transactions. This is accomplished through cryptographic signing and encryption to protect against fraud and ensure the security of funds. For cryptocurrency investors and users concerned about privacy, Crypton checks all the right boxes.
The instant, irreversible settlement of Crypton transactions also makes it attractive as a payment method. Merchants and vendors can benefit from fast transaction times without the risk of reversal. These are advantages Crypton has over traditional fiat currency payment rails.
Crypton can also be earned through mining to support the Utopia network infrastructure. This promotes greater decentralization and alignment of incentives. Miners earn newly minted Crypton as well as interest on their balances, providing recurring yield.
Importantly, Crypton has a real-world use case powering the Utopia ecosystem. It is not just an abstract investment asset. Adoption of Utopia for private communication and transactions will drive Demand for Crypton over time.
For cryptocurrency investors interested in privacy, security, speed, and an associated ecosystem, Crypton checks all the boxes. As Utopia continues growing, it represents an asymmetric opportunity compared to other crypto assets. For these reasons, Crypton is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to invest in for the long-term.
AQLA is designed to capitalize on the massive and rapidly growing carbon offset market, estimated to reach $250 billion by Morgan Stanley. With global carbon emissions continuing to rise, the need for carbon offsets and mitigation projects will only increase in the coming years.
AQLA aims to bring credibility and transparency to carbon offsets by recording them on its blockchain platform. This provides tamper-proof verification of the offsets and allows them to be tokenized and traded efficiently. The blockchain approach solves key issues like double-counting and verification that have hindered the offset market’s growth.
The project has a global vision of promoting awareness and enabling businesses to adopt carbon neutral practices. As climate change concerns grow, this first-mover advantage in the blockchain carbon space gives AQLA huge room for adoption. Its standards and methodologies align with major international climate agreements as well.
Additionally, AQLA is actively developing real-world use cases in voluntary carbon markets to back green technologies. This creates utility and demand for the AQLA token beyond just speculation. The wider applicability in ESG solutions also expands its total addressable market.
With environmental sustainability becoming increasingly important worldwide, AQLA is a purpose-built solution catering to massive needs. Its blockchain platform and token allow climate action to scale exponentially. For investors, getting in early with AQLA provides exposure to a rapidly expanding space. The project’s sustainability focus also gives it an ethical edge over other crypto offerings.
XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, an open-source, decentralized blockchain created by Ripple Labs. It is designed to facilitate fast, affordable global financial transactions.
A key advantage of XRP is its speed – transactions settle in 3-5 seconds. This makes it well-suited for cross-border payments and currency exchanges where slow processing times currently cause delays and high costs. Financial institutions can save significant time and money by using XRP.
Additionally, XRP has very low transaction fees at a fraction of a penny per transaction. This scalable cost structure allows XRP to handle high transaction volumes without becoming prohibitively expensive.
Ripple is aggressively pushing adoption of XRP by partnering with major financial institutions and money transfer services globally. These partnerships are critical for giving XRP real-world utility and payment volume to drive demand.
Developments like Ripple’s acquisition of a money transfer service and XRP’s increasing use for cheaper remittances in emerging markets demonstrate this adoption. As more entities utilize XRP for liquidity and payments, its status as a leading digital asset will solidify.
With a large circulating supply, XRP can handle massive transaction volumes without illiquidity. The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and XRP is well positioned to emerge as an enterprise-grade asset especially for financial transactions. For investors, getting onboard this growing use case early could provide substantial long-term upside.
Dogecoin stands out from other cryptocurrencies because of its branding and approachability as the original “fun and friendly” internet money. The Doge meme makes it more accessible to the mainstream public versus other cryptos with obscure names or technical focus.
This friendliness has translated to fast adoption and community growth, with Dogecoin boasting over 4 million followers across social media. The large passionate community gives Dogecoin strength and viral potential that many coins lack.
A major recent development was Elon Musk’s endorsement of Dogecoin and self-proclaimed status as the “Dogefather.” Musk has an unparalleled influence in the crypto space and frequently promotes Dogecoin to his millions of followers. This high-profile celebrity backing sets Dogecoin apart.
Unlike Bitcoin which has a hard cap of 21 million coins, Dogecoin’s supply increases 5 billion coins per year. This makes it better suited as a transactional currency because more supply prevents deflationary spirals as demand rises. The inflationary dynamic encourages spending versus just HODLing the coin.
For investors, Dogecoin offers asymmetric upside because of its extremely low price compared to other major cryptos. Despite its beginnings as a joke, Dogecoin’s brand appeal, passionate community, influential backers, and transactional use case give it a unique advantage that should not be underestimated going forward.
BAD IDEA combines three highly promising technologies – AI, blockchain, and DAOs – into one ambitious experiment. It is unique in letting decentralized AI agents participate equally in governance and decision-making. If successful, this could pioneer a new model for blockchain projects.
Allowing AI agents to have voting rights and manage treasury funds autonomously is innovative. The agents can dynamically adjust the tokenomics and monetary policy based on data versus being locked into a rigid set of rules. This gives BAD IDEA the flexibility to optimize sustainability.
The project produces thought-provoking content on integrating AI into blockchain and Web3. This demonstrates real-world applications versus being just a speculative asset. BAD IDEA aims to address complex issues like climate change through decentralized collaboration.
Although named tongue-in-cheek, BAD IDEA is seriously researching the possibilities of AI-powered governance. The token distribution allocates funds for different development branches to incentivize continuous innovation.
With AI playing an increasing role across industries, BAD IDEA is getting ahead of the curve by researching how to harmonize AI with human governance. The project welcomes community feedback and participation, creating a collaborative environment.
For investors, BAD IDEA offers exposure to a potentially game-changing decentralized governance model. The project’s growth is connected directly to real R&D versus hype, giving it fundamental substance.
The cryptocurrency market is always evolving with new innovative projects and economic cycles. While prices have declined in 2022 from the highs, this bear period provides the perfect chance to research and invest in projects with strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential. The five cryptocurrencies discussed in this article – Crypton, AQLA, XRP, Dogecoin, and BAD IDEA Token – are leaders in their respective categories and have major developments on the horizon.
Whether it is the privacy and security of Crypton fueling Utopia, the carbon offset potential of AQLA, the speed and scalability of XRP for payments, the mainstream brand appeal of Dogecoin, or the cutting-edge governance experiment of the BAD IDEA Token – each cryptocurrency offers investors an intriguing asymmetric opportunity. The markets may be driven by fear and uncertainty now, but the future remains bright for blockchain technology. Maintaining a long-term horizon and accumulating promising crypto assets during bear markets has proven to be a winning strategy throughout the history of this nascent asset class.

Additionally, AQLA is actively developing real-world use cases in voluntary carbon markets to back green technologies. This creates utility and demand for the AQLA token beyond just speculation. The wider applicability in ESG solutions also expands its total addressable market.
With environmental sustainability becoming increasingly important worldwide, AQLA is a purpose-built solution catering to massive needs. Its blockchain platform and token allow climate action to scale exponentially. For investors, getting in early with AQLA provides exposure to a rapidly expanding space. The project’s sustainability focus also gives it an ethical edge over other crypto offerings.
XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, an open-source, decentralized blockchain created by Ripple Labs. It is designed to facilitate fast, affordable global financial transactions.
A key advantage of XRP is its speed – transactions settle in 3-5 seconds. This makes it well-suited for cross-border payments and currency exchanges where slow processing times currently cause delays and high costs. Financial institutions can save significant time and money by using XRP.
Additionally, XRP has very low transaction fees at a fraction of a penny per transaction. This scalable cost structure allows XRP to handle high transaction volumes without becoming prohibitively expensive.
Ripple is aggressively pushing adoption of XRP by partnering with major financial institutions and money transfer services globally. These partnerships are critical for giving XRP real-world utility and payment volume to drive demand.
Developments like Ripple’s acquisition of a money transfer service and XRP’s increasing use for cheaper remittances in emerging markets demonstrate this adoption. As more entities utilize XRP for liquidity and payments, its status as a leading digital asset will solidify.
With a large circulating supply, XRP can handle massive transaction volumes without illiquidity. The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and XRP is well positioned to emerge as an enterprise-grade asset especially for financial transactions. For investors, getting onboard this growing use case early could provide substantial long-term upside.
Dogecoin stands out from other cryptocurrencies because of its branding and approachability as the original “fun and friendly” internet money. The Doge meme makes it more accessible to the mainstream public versus other cryptos with obscure names or technical focus.
This friendliness has translated to fast adoption and community growth, with Dogecoin boasting over 4 million followers across social media. The large passionate community gives Dogecoin strength and viral potential that many coins lack.
A major recent development was Elon Musk’s endorsement of Dogecoin and self-proclaimed status as the “Dogefather.” Musk has an unparalleled influence in the crypto space and frequently promotes Dogecoin to his millions of followers. This high-profile celebrity backing sets Dogecoin apart.
Unlike Bitcoin which has a hard cap of 21 million coins, Dogecoin’s supply increases 5 billion coins per year. This makes it better suited as a transactional currency because more supply prevents deflationary spirals as demand rises. The inflationary dynamic encourages spending versus just HODLing the coin.
For investors, Dogecoin offers asymmetric upside because of its extremely low price compared to other major cryptos. Despite its beginnings as a joke, Dogecoin’s brand appeal, passionate community, influential backers, and transactional use case give it a unique advantage that should not be underestimated going forward.
BAD IDEA combines three highly promising technologies – AI, blockchain, and DAOs – into one ambitious experiment. It is unique in letting decentralized AI agents participate equally in governance and decision-making. If successful, this could pioneer a new model for blockchain projects.
Allowing AI agents to have voting rights and manage treasury funds autonomously is innovative. The agents can dynamically adjust the tokenomics and monetary policy based on data versus being locked into a rigid set of rules. This gives BAD IDEA the flexibility to optimize sustainability.
The project produces thought-provoking content on integrating AI into blockchain and Web3. This demonstrates real-world applications versus being just a speculative asset. BAD IDEA aims to address complex issues like climate change through decentralized collaboration.
Although named tongue-in-cheek, BAD IDEA is seriously researching the possibilities of AI-powered governance. The token distribution allocates funds for different development branches to incentivize continuous innovation.
With AI playing an increasing role across industries, BAD IDEA is getting ahead of the curve by researching how to harmonize AI with human governance. The project welcomes community feedback and participation, creating a collaborative environment.
For investors, BAD IDEA offers exposure to a potentially game-changing decentralized governance model. The project’s growth is connected directly to real R&D versus hype, giving it fundamental substance.
The cryptocurrency market is always evolving with new innovative projects and economic cycles. While prices have declined in 2022 from the highs, this bear period provides the perfect chance to research and invest in projects with strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential. The five cryptocurrencies discussed in this article – Crypton, AQLA, XRP, Dogecoin, and BAD IDEA Token – are leaders in their respective categories and have major developments on the horizon.
Whether it is the privacy and security of Crypton fueling Utopia, the carbon offset potential of AQLA, the speed and scalability of XRP for payments, the mainstream brand appeal of Dogecoin, or the cutting-edge governance experiment of the BAD IDEA Token – each cryptocurrency offers investors an intriguing asymmetric opportunity. The markets may be driven by fear and uncertainty now, but the future remains bright for blockchain technology. Maintaining a long-term horizon and accumulating promising crypto assets during bear markets has proven to be a winning strategy throughout the history of this nascent asset class.

ThorChain Hits Record-Setting $355 Million Trading Volume in a Day;"ThorChain, a decentralized liquidity protocol, reported a record-breaking transaction volume on Oct. 5, with the number surging to $355 million in a single day, marking an all-time high.
This noteworthy event is part of a larger trend as the cumulative transaction volume over the past five days has surpassed the $1 billion mark.
According to the analysis, the surge in transaction volume coincided with the rise in swap counts associated with the network. On Oct. 5, when the transaction volume was close to $355 million, the count of swaps related to the network was 115,630.
This was an upward surge compared to the preceding day, when the swap count was 61,877, and the total volume was merely $170.8 million.
The daily change in transaction volume from Oct. 4 to Oct. 5 was a massive 107.6% increase.
A look at the charts indicates an upward trajectory in the transaction volumes since Sept. 29. While the network reported just about $34.45 million as total volume on Sept. 29, the value increased to $60.14 million the next day and $166.4 by Oct. 1.
Later, on Oct. 2, the total transaction volume made a new high of $197.33 million before minor plunges were noted at $173.84 million and $170.84 million between Oct. 3 and 4, respectively. Between Oct. 1 and 5, the cumulative transaction volume was $1.063 billion.
As the transaction volumes seemingly surged, so did the earnings volume associated with the network. On Oct. 4, the liquidity earning was about $109K, and the bond earning stood at $66.7K, a major decline from the highs recorded on Oct. 2. However, on Oct. 5, the liquidity and bond earnings stood at $164.35K and $101.96K, respectively.
As per analysts, the sudden volume surge can be linked to increased hacking activities recently, especially with cross-chain BTC transactions being the main contributor to the massive volume surge.
To address these adverse events, reports indicate that ThorSwap, a product of ThorChain, has paused the platform, shifting into maintenance mode.
When speaking of the developments, ThorSwap developer tweeted;
“Yesterday, following a careful evaluation of the situation and consultation with advisors, legal counsel, and law enforcement, the decision was made to temporarily transition the THORSwap interface into maintenance mode. This action was taken to swiftly curtail any further potential illicit activity.”
Fellow THORChads,
A pressing and persistent concern has recently come to light: the potential movement of illicit funds through THORChain and, specifically, THORSwap. Such activities have no place on the THORSwap platform, and THORSwap stands firmly against any and all criminal…
— THORSwap  #BetterThanCEX (@THORSwap) October 6, 2023

The tweet noted that ThorSwap will remain in this mode till the developers find a more permanent solution to implement and bolster the platform’s continued security and integrity.
The native token of the ThorChain network, Rune, has been trading in the red for most of the past 24 hours. Starting the day at 2.048, the token surged to $2.1 before plunging to a low of about $1.93. Reports indicate that the token has lost about 2,51% in value in the 24 hours from October 5 till the reporting time.
However, the story is quite different in the past seven days, with Rune trading in the green. Starting at $1.92 on Sept. 29, Rune surged to a high of $2.23 on Oct. 2 before falling to a low of $1.88 on Oct. 4.
The charts suggest that the assets have mainly shown a sideways price action, especially in the past five days. However, in the past week, Rune has gained about 3.02% in value.

‘Trading Through Gamification Can Represent the Future’ Says Banksters’ Alexandru Carbunariu;"While centralized exchanges (cexs) are instrumental in helping new users grasp all things crypto, they nevertheless do not go “the extra mile in educating their audience properly,” Alexandru Carbunariu, the CMO at the edutech simulator Banksters, has asserted. According to Carbunariu, a Web3 advisor, properly educating newbies includes making the experience more interactive and fun. He added that Web3 platforms should take a leaf out of their Web2 counterparts’ playbook.
Expanding on the argument that education should be more fun, the CMO said he concurred with those who believe gamification to be the right way of encouraging more positive trading behavior. However, Carbunariu told Bitcoin.com News that while “trading through gamification may represent the future,” many of the current Web3 games may “have taken a wrong turn.”
When asked for his thoughts on the so-called trade-to-win strategy, the Banksters CMO insisted that such a model is better than play-to-earn (P2E) models because it engenders confidence. He suggested that such a model can be ideal for newcomers. Meanwhile, in written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, Carbunariu also articulated why competition is necessary for Web3 platforms looking to get communities attached to their respective products.
Below are Alexandru Carbunariu‘s responses to all questions sent.
Bitcoin.com News (BCN): Centralized exchanges (cexs) are one of the gateways to all things crypto for new users and most of them have taken on the job of educating newcomers. In your opinion, what can they do better or differently to bring in more Web2 users via education?
Alexandru Carbunariu (AC): Speaking from experience, centralized exchanges don’t take the extra mile in educating their audience properly. A lot more things should be done in terms of education, to make it more fun, more rewarding as well as more interactive. We should check what Web2 asset platforms do and get inspired by their work. We rarely see that in Web3. However, we believe that with new regulations, specific training models will come up.
What needs to be done in order to attract Web2 users:
Create interactive training that will provide incentives (like we have seen Revolut doing).
Use normal KOLs [key opinion leaders] to present their products in a transparent [way] but also using normal non-technical language.
Try to introduce academy programs, where normal users can attend, therefore the knowledge will be much higher. Provide transparency when involving risks. Introduce alerts when the user is lost in the complex UX / UI of the platform.
BCN: Do you believe gamification is the right approach to encouraging positive crypto trading behavior with long-term benefits?
AC: Of course. Creating a more fun environment can be relaxing for the user, and if you don’t mix that with financial loss, it’s actually perfect. We are one of the first to build this type of concept. Our A/B tests, focus groups as well user validation were high, meaning that we were on the right track.
I believe that the Web3 games have taken a wrong turn, and the project owners have lost focus. Web3 should be the gateway to the future and it should provide new ways, apart from the traditional ones, in order to onboard as many users.
Trading through gamification can represent the future. First users need to understand it, then they will trade or invest with caution. If their first experience provides them with losses, then they are unlikely to come back. This is why Banksters has stepped in and is helping them to understand more about crypto, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and trading.

BCN: Can you describe what the trade-to-win model is all about and how this differs from play-to-earn?
AC: In the past 2-3 years we have seen the “P2E” as well as the “P&E” types. One thing they have in common is the fact that they have not identified a balance that will give them a much-needed token stability.
Our Trade2Win model lets the user:
First test the product
Learn about the product
Play around with it
And become a winner
This is the model that provides more confidence, and the rewards will come only at the end, meaning if you are a winner then the rewards will be won. This is a more or less “shadow” plan from the trading world, where you need to practice, learn, trade and then gain profits.
BCN: Trading is an umbrella term that encompasses various strategies based on an individual’s mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors. How does your platform help users figure out an optimal strategy for them through low-risk education?
AC: This is a very good question. To give a more of a straight answer: Yes and No. Basically, we can cover this through our so-called “Abilities” which can be compared with “Superpowers” a hero avatar has in the Web2 games. Abilities actually “copy” what is happening on the real market. There are abilities like:
Elon Musk Tweet
Vitalik’s Support
CZ’s Effect
Market Squeeze
Pump and Dump
Hype
Insider Trade
These are real-life trading events, and in many cases, traders or users don’t understand them. What Banksters did was to analyze all of the historical pricing for these events, develop a price algorithm then infuse them into these Abilities.
Now the user will understand what happens to their portfolio and how it will react when these Abilities are used. This actually provides no risk for the user as well as covers a new mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors.
BCN: Whether it’s crypto trading or something else, competition is often an integral part of that. How is Banksters encouraging competition among users?
AC: They are highly competitive! We often have tournaments and live streams which reward users with real USDT. It drives them to use the product and makes them happy with both the game but also the environment.
We strongly believe that competitions, challenges, tournaments and livestreams definitely help the community being attached to the product, while the team can gather transparent and vital feedback.
BCN: When discussing factors holding back large-scale adoption of crypto, lack of education and intuitive user interface (UI) often get the most attention. However, could it be that we have not had mass adoption because the crypto ecosystem is still struggling to find the product-market fit?
AC: Another good question. The answer is pretty simple. It’s about money. However, it’s more than that. For example:
Users:
A lot of people have lost their hard-earned money during the bear market while listening to the unprepared and uneducated key opinion leaders (KOLs) who often accept to promote projects with no filters.
Project Owners:
If one puts two years and $10,000 in the right way, they could raise between $500,000 and a million dollars while having absolutely no experience in blockchain tech, development, management, marketing, or product growth. This, however, has changed and now a lot of Web2 specialists are entering the Web3 space and I believe the standard will go just higher.
Centralized Exchanges:
Providing crazy leverages, with no education, with no warning, and to top all that with FTX keeping their crypto wallet keys in a Google form.
At the end of the day, human nature had to kick in, meaning something terrible had to happen in order for something to be changed.
I think Web3 has gone through a reset in the past 2-3 years, and now, finally, we can see some highly professional projects with funding resources delivering innovative products. Such projects have higher odds of finding product-market fit and accelerating adoption.

Bitcoin And Crypto Under The Lens As Bond Market Recalls 2008 Crash;"As the global financial landscape witnesses a seismic shift, reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble burst, alarm bells are ringing in the bond market, alerting the Bitcoin and crypto market as well.
Renowned Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Genevieve Roch-Decter, highlighted the striking parallels in a recent tweet, stating, “I can’t believe I am saying this but the slump in 10-year and 30-year bonds is approaching the epic drops we saw in stocks during the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble bust.”
Bloomberg Surveillance’s Lisa Abramowicz reinforces this grim narrative, pointing out that “bonds maturing in 10 years or more have slumped 46% since peaking in March 2020, just shy of the 49% plunge in US stocks in the aftermath of the dot-com bust. The route in 30-year bonds has been even worse, tumbling 53%.”
Onramp, a Bitcoin asset management platform, adds further context by emphasizing the historic nature of the trend. This decline, particularly in bonds with maturities exceeding a decade, harkens back to market downturns like the dot-com bubble collapse. The Federal Reserve’s resolute stance on inflation and a fragile fiscal environment have disrupted the traditional appeal of long-maturity debt, raising questions about the possibility of a debt spiral.
The situation is further complicated by the behavior of the yield curve. Historically, an inverted yield curve has foreshadowed recessions. However, the recent correction has seen a rare “bear steepener,” marked by rising long-term yields. This phenomenon, seen in the past before recessions, raises concerns of an impending economic downturn.
“While some question the yield curve’s reliability as a recession indicator, the current bear steepening suggests that an economic downturn could be imminent. This is particularly concerning given the Fed’s ongoing commitment to restrictive monetary policy, making the situation ripe for potential market volatility and economic uncertainty, “ Dylan LeClair from Onramp notes.
Meanwhile, Barclays’ analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha suggests that only a stock market crash could halt the bond market’s decline. Unlike previous cycles, traditional bond backstops are dwindling, with the Fed shifting from a net buyer to a net seller, and foreign institutional buying slowing.
This highlights the stark disconnect between equity valuations and long-end bond rates, with stocks having significant room for devaluation before bonds stabilize. And if stocks crash, Bitcoin and crypto could be just as affected.
The turmoil in the bond market has far-reaching implications, including its impact on Bitcoin and crypto. Remarkably, the crypto market has never experienced such a situation, but there are general observations of how risk assets have reacted in such environments in the past.
First, rising treasury yields make risk-free returns more attractive, potentially prompting some investors to reallocate capital from risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto to treasury bills. This shift could decrease demand, putting downward pressure on their prices.
Moreover, a sharp rise in 10-year Treasury yields can signal a tighter monetary policy, weighing on risk assets. Higher yields also mean higher borrowing costs, which can impact crypto. When interest rates rise, non-interest-bearing assets like Bitcoin may seem less attractive compared to yield-bearing assets.
A significant increase in Treasury yields can also lead to reduced liquidity in other financial markets, such as the Bitcoin and crypto space. Institutional investors facing liquidity constraints may liquidate more liquid assets like BTC and altcoins causing potential price declines.
Lastly, sharp yield increases can create volatility across various asset classes as investors seek to reduce risk or cover losses elsewhere. Bitcoin and crypto are highly influenced by market sentiment and speculative behavior. The market’s interpretation of rising yields can sway investor behavior, impacting crypto prices.
Accordingly, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, recently predicted:
The 10YR is up another 10% since! […] The Fed wants more unemployment. The job market is still too strong. They’ve raised the expected 2024 rates as a result and the 10YR has broken out to new decade highs. As long as the 10YR is breaking upwards like this, risk assets are going to see further headwinds.
At press time, BTC traded at $27,576.

First, rising treasury yields make risk-free returns more attractive, potentially prompting some investors to reallocate capital from risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto to treasury bills. This shift could decrease demand, putting downward pressure on their prices.
Moreover, a sharp rise in 10-year Treasury yields can signal a tighter monetary policy, weighing on risk assets. Higher yields also mean higher borrowing costs, which can impact crypto. When interest rates rise, non-interest-bearing assets like Bitcoin may seem less attractive compared to yield-bearing assets.
A significant increase in Treasury yields can also lead to reduced liquidity in other financial markets, such as the Bitcoin and crypto space. Institutional investors facing liquidity constraints may liquidate more liquid assets like BTC and altcoins causing potential price declines.
Lastly, sharp yield increases can create volatility across various asset classes as investors seek to reduce risk or cover losses elsewhere. Bitcoin and crypto are highly influenced by market sentiment and speculative behavior. The market’s interpretation of rising yields can sway investor behavior, impacting crypto prices.
Accordingly, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, recently predicted:
The 10YR is up another 10% since! […] The Fed wants more unemployment. The job market is still too strong. They’ve raised the expected 2024 rates as a result and the 10YR has broken out to new decade highs. As long as the 10YR is breaking upwards like this, risk assets are going to see further headwinds.
At press time, BTC traded at $27,576.

Crypto: 50% Users Invest To Improve Living Standards;"The crypto industry has experienced substantial expansion over the years, characterized by significant increases in both value and widespread adoption. What was once primarily associated with the dark web has transformed into a sector that is increasingly embraced by individuals worldwide. This transformation underscores the fact that crypto investments have transcended mere speculation for a significant portion of the population.
A recent survey conducted by Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, and published on Oct. 5, 2023, provides valuable insights into how digital assets are now instrumental in elevating living standards. These assets have been accomplishing various financial objectives for users around the world.
About half of crypto users, or around 50%, are directing their investments with the aim of enhancing their everyday living conditions. The survey’s findings indicate that in countries such as South Korea, Canada, and Turkey, 46%, 44%, and 41% of respondents, respectively, have identified this as their foremost financial goal when engaging in digital asset investments.
Moreover, the survey reveals that approximately 36% of participants from Malaysia and Taiwan place a higher priority on improving their family’s overall quality of life. This was when compared to other financial aspirations.
The extensive survey collected information during the period spanning from May to August. It included participation from more than 1,500 individuals representing 20 countries across Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, the United States, and Canada. 
Notably, the survey also illuminated diverse motivations among female crypto investors in different nations. For instance, in the United States and Turkey, around 27% of female crypto investors have their investment in crypto. It is mostly driven by the desire to finance their children’s education. In contrast, this particular goal was less prevalent in South Korea and Japan. Only 5% of female investors expressed the same aspiration.

In terms of Chinese involvement, the survey provided insights into the extent of engagement among crypto users in China. Despite the prohibition on crypto trading within the country, the survey findings suggest that Chinese citizens are actively in the crypto market.
A significant 18% of survey respondents from China stated that they had invested amounts ranging from $50,000 to $100,000. Amidst this, an additional 19% had committed investments between $100,000 and $500,000. It’s worth noting that Chinese nationals can still possess cryptocurrencies and navigate around the trading ban by using VPNs. Additionally, the ban does not apply to Chinese nationals who reside outside of China.

The year 2022 is destined to be remembered as one of the most challenging periods for the crypto industry. It witnessed a substantial decline, with Bitcoin, in particular, experiencing a loss exceeding 60% of its value. Additionally, the overall market incurred losses of just over $2 trillion during the year. Furthermore, this tumultuous period saw the downfall of several crypto firms. However, FTX was the most disruptive of them all. As Sam Bankman-Fried, the figure behind FTX, faces a jury that will determine his future, there are signs that confidence in the crypto market is gradually being reestablished.
In addition to these developments, Bitcoin [BTC] was observed making strides toward a path of resurgence. At press time, BTC was trading at $27,587.30, approaching the $28,000 mark.

Is JPEX Facing the Same Catastrophe as FTX Exchange? Here’s What Happening;"The post Is JPEX Facing the Same Catastrophe as FTX Exchange? Here’s What Happening appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
In recent events, the JPEX virtual asset trading platform(VATPs)in Hong Kong has come under scrutiny for its suspected involvement in a major fraud case. This development has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the current regulatory framework governing cryptocurrencies. Xu Zhengyu, a prominent financial commentator, has emphasized the urgent need for more robust oversight in the industry. This article delves into the JPEX scandal and the pressing demand for a comprehensive regulatory system for cryptocurrencies.
Hui Ching-yu, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury expressed his concerns during an investment committee interview program. He underscored that the JPEX scandal highlights the pressing need for regulatory supervision in the virtual asset sector. Furthermore, he pointed out a significant regulatory gap in Hong Kong — the absence of a stablecoin framework.
Xu Zhengyu, speaking in a live online program of the Investment and Financial Education Committee, shed light on the high risks associated with unregulated virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms often lack transparency and may operate without stability or reliability. In the event of disputes or platform failures, investors have limited avenues for recourse, potentially resulting in substantial financial losses. Notable incidents, like FTX’s collapse overseas and the recent JPEX case in Hong Kong, serve as stark reminders of these risks.
Many virtual asset trading platforms have historically relied on stablecoins like USDT as trading mediums. Xu Zhengyu emphasized the necessity for these coins to maintain value stability by being backed by US dollars or gold. However, past instances have demonstrated that stablecoins can experience significant price volatility or collapse. Xu stressed that the management of reserves by stablecoin issuers directly impacts price stability and investors’ ability to redeem fiat currencies. Given these challenges, Hong Kong has refrained from permitting retail trading in stablecoins until comprehensive regulations are in place.
To safeguard investor interests and prevent conflicts of interest, Huang Lexin, Director of the Licensing Section and Head of the Financial Technology Group of the Intermediary Department of the SFC, outlined certain restrictions for licensed virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms are prohibited from offering various investment products, including periodic “pledges,” interest collection services, deposits, and derivatives transactions.
Huang Lexin also noted that SFC-licensed virtual asset trading platforms are limited to facilitating the purchase and sale of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for retail investors. Any introduction of new currencies on these platforms must adhere to stringent reporting requirements and obtain approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission before becoming available for trading.

Bitcoin and altcoins pushing higher;"Friday has dawned brightly for the crypto sector and a push to the upside is taking place.
If stock markets fall, then this is certainly transferred to the crypto market, and being high risk assets, they are likely to fall hard. However, there are still fluctuations in markets, and they go up as well as down.
After five days of sideways action Bitcoin is rising once again.
Bitcoin found support towards the end of September at the $26,000 level and has been steadily trending upwards ever since. At time of going to press bitcoin is once more at the $27,600 resistance level, and finally taking this out and flipping it into support would be an important step in bitcoin’s climb higher.
Of course, there is still the thorny issue of the 200-week moving average just above, which previously stopped bitcoin in its tracks at $28,000. However, the trend is still up, and if bitcoin keeps knocking at this level it is likely to break through eventually.
If the Alpha beast of the crypto jungle rises then the altcoins will normally follow. Ethereum is having a strong day so far, and is currently butting up against resistance at $1,630. However, it does appear to be breaking the downwards trend from October 1, so look to $ETH to perhaps also break resistance.
Solana is having an even better day thus far. 3% up currently, $SOL is heading back to $24 at a fast rate of knots. The Solana community has its Breakpoint 2023 Conference coming up at the end of the month, and this perhaps why $SOL is moving strongly up again.
A bullish flag has been forming since the beginning of October, and $SOL looks to be breaking out. A measured move for the breakout would take the $SOL price to $29, flipping the resistance at $26 into support. 
Render ($RNDR) is another altcoin riding high. Up 1.75% on the day, $RNDR is battling resistance at $1.75. Should it overcome this, the next resistance at $1.80 awaits, with the 200-week moving average just above.
Render’s founder, Jules Urbach, is speaking at the Solana Breakpoint Conference. What he has to say is likely to be very interesting, although a ‘sell-the-news’ reaction on the $RNDR price may also be likely.

BCH Price Analysis: Will This Pattern Push BCH TO $300?;"The post BCH Price Analysis: Will This Pattern Push BCH TO $300? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
As the overall market recovers, with Bitcoin taking a bullish step in October, the altcoins are on a positive track. Even though the BCH price breached the $250 mark in the first two days of October with a remarkable growth of 10%. 
Despite this, the overhead supply pressure at the psychological level caused a sharp correction in the Bitcoin Cash market price. However, with the sentiment turning bullish, expectations for the Bitcoin Cash price prediction in 2023 remain optimistic.
Although there has been a recent correction, the overall trend of the BCH price suggests a bullish revival and a rise to higher levels. The bullish reversal from the buyers’ region at $180 and the 200-day EMA provided the Bitcoin Cash price with a springboard to regain momentum.
Moreover, the recent sharp correction to the $230 mark increases the chances of an inverted head and shoulder. Currently, the altcoin price trades at $231.50, with multiple Doji candle formations at the $230 support level.
With the underlying bullish sentiments averting downfall, the chances of BCH price taking a reversal to $250 are increasing. This recovery phase will complete the bullish pattern with the neckline at $250.
Technical indicators:
Coming to the technical indicators, the Directional Movement Index sustains a bullish point of view. 
DMI indicator: The ADX line (black line) has shot up in recent times, indicating a strong momentum. Additionally, the DI line remains bullish, signaling further recovery.
EMA: The 50 and 200-day EMA maintain a positive alignment and continue to rise higher, which certifies the uptrend in motion. 
With plans for a bullish reversal from $230, the inverted head and shoulder pattern presents a trend reversal opportunity in BCH price. However, if the price struggles to overcome the $250 mark, it may lead to a potential pullback to $228. 
However, the inverted head and shoulder breakout will increase the likelihood of Bitcoin Cash price exceeding $300. With the potential to continue the rally above, the reversal from $250 or the $250 breakout will prove a crucial entry point for sideline buyers. 
Considering the price breaks below the $228 post, the downtrend will plunge the prices to $200.

Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the 2023 ;"The post Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the 2023  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
After the crypto market euphoria of 2021, prices have cooled considerably in 2022 and early 2023. Bitcoin, Ethereum and most major cryptocurrencies are down 60-80% from their all-time highs. This bear market provides the perfect chance to accumulate top cryptocurrencies at discounted prices before the next major bull market.
Just as the stock market moves through periods of boom and bust, so too does the nascent cryptocurrency market follow predictable cycles. We have already witnessed this pattern with a bull run in 2017 giving way to a multi-year bear trend, before the huge surge in 2020-21. Now, as crypto winter sets in, savvy investors know that the best time to buy is when there is “blood in the streets.”
History has shown patience pays off handsomely for those accumulating top-tier crypto assets when prices are depressed. When the next wave of institutional and retail adoption comes, supply squeezes for scarce assets like Bitcoin will drive prices higher. Leading smart contract platforms like Ethereum will also benefit from further mainstream utilization in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, metaverse and Web3 applications.
This article highlights 5 of the most promising cryptocurrencies to add to your portfolio during the 2023 bear market. With fundamental development continuing apace despite price declines, our recommended crypto assets are prime to generate tremendous upside for investors with long time horizons. Periods of fear and uncertainty often provide the greatest opportunities – the forward-thinking will stake their claims now and reap substantial rewards during the next bull cycle.

AQLA is designed to capitalize on the massive and rapidly growing carbon offset market, estimated to reach $250 billion by Morgan Stanley. With global carbon emissions continuing to rise, the need for carbon offsets and mitigation projects will only increase in the coming years.
AQLA aims to bring credibility and transparency to carbon offsets by recording them on its blockchain platform. This provides tamper-proof verification of the offsets and allows them to be tokenized and traded efficiently. The blockchain approach solves key issues like double-counting and verification that have hindered the offset market’s growth.
The project has a global vision of promoting awareness and enabling businesses to adopt carbon neutral practices. As climate change concerns grow, this first-mover advantage in the blockchain carbon space gives AQLA huge room for adoption. Its standards and methodologies align with major international climate agreements as well.
Additionally, AQLA is actively developing real-world use cases in voluntary carbon markets to back green technologies. This creates utility and demand for the AQLA token beyond just speculation. The wider applicability in ESG solutions also expands its total addressable market.
With environmental sustainability becoming increasingly important worldwide, AQLA is a purpose-built solution catering to massive needs. Its blockchain platform and token allow climate action to scale exponentially. For investors, getting in early with AQLA provides exposure to a rapidly expanding space. The project’s sustainability focus also gives it an ethical edge over other crypto offerings.
XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, an open-source, decentralized blockchain created by Ripple Labs. It is designed to facilitate fast, affordable global financial transactions.
A key advantage of XRP is its speed – transactions settle in 3-5 seconds. This makes it well-suited for cross-border payments and currency exchanges where slow processing times currently cause delays and high costs. Financial institutions can save significant time and money by using XRP.
Additionally, XRP has very low transaction fees at a fraction of a penny per transaction. This scalable cost structure allows XRP to handle high transaction volumes without becoming prohibitively expensive.
Ripple is aggressively pushing adoption of XRP by partnering with major financial institutions and money transfer services globally. These partnerships are critical for giving XRP real-world utility and payment volume to drive demand.
Developments like Ripple’s acquisition of a money transfer service and XRP’s increasing use for cheaper remittances in emerging markets demonstrate this adoption. As more entities utilize XRP for liquidity and payments, its status as a leading digital asset will solidify.
With a large circulating supply, XRP can handle massive transaction volumes without illiquidity. The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and XRP is well positioned to emerge as an enterprise-grade asset especially for financial transactions. For investors, getting onboard this growing use case early could provide substantial long-term upside.
Dogecoin stands out from other cryptocurrencies because of its branding and approachability as the original “fun and friendly” internet money. The Doge meme makes it more accessible to the mainstream public versus other cryptos with obscure names or technical focus.
This friendliness has translated to fast adoption and community growth, with Dogecoin boasting over 4 million followers across social media. The large passionate community gives Dogecoin strength and viral potential that many coins lack.
A major recent development was Elon Musk’s endorsement of Dogecoin and self-proclaimed status as the “Dogefather.” Musk has an unparalleled influence in the crypto space and frequently promotes Dogecoin to his millions of followers. This high-profile celebrity backing sets Dogecoin apart.
Unlike Bitcoin which has a hard cap of 21 million coins, Dogecoin’s supply increases 5 billion coins per year. This makes it better suited as a transactional currency because more supply prevents deflationary spirals as demand rises. The inflationary dynamic encourages spending versus just HODLing the coin.
For investors, Dogecoin offers asymmetric upside because of its extremely low price compared to other major cryptos. Despite its beginnings as a joke, Dogecoin’s brand appeal, passionate community, influential backers, and transactional use case give it a unique advantage that should not be underestimated going forward.
BAD IDEA combines three highly promising technologies – AI, blockchain, and DAOs – into one ambitious experiment. It is unique in letting decentralized AI agents participate equally in governance and decision-making. If successful, this could pioneer a new model for blockchain projects.
Allowing AI agents to have voting rights and manage treasury funds autonomously is innovative. The agents can dynamically adjust the tokenomics and monetary policy based on data versus being locked into a rigid set of rules. This gives BAD IDEA the flexibility to optimize sustainability.
The project produces thought-provoking content on integrating AI into blockchain and Web3. This demonstrates real-world applications versus being just a speculative asset. BAD IDEA aims to address complex issues like climate change through decentralized collaboration.
Although named tongue-in-cheek, BAD IDEA is seriously researching the possibilities of AI-powered governance. The token distribution allocates funds for different development branches to incentivize continuous innovation.
With AI playing an increasing role across industries, BAD IDEA is getting ahead of the curve by researching how to harmonize AI with human governance. The project welcomes community feedback and participation, creating a collaborative environment.
For investors, BAD IDEA offers exposure to a potentially game-changing decentralized governance model. The project’s growth is connected directly to real R&D versus hype, giving it fundamental substance.
The cryptocurrency market is always evolving with new innovative projects and economic cycles.

The post Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the 2023  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
After the crypto market euphoria of 2021, prices have cooled considerably in 2022 and early 2023. Bitcoin, Ethereum and most major cryptocurrencies are down 60-80% from their all-time highs. This bear market provides the perfect chance to accumulate top cryptocurrencies at discounted prices before the next major bull market.
Just as the stock market moves through periods of boom and bust, so too does the nascent cryptocurrency market follow predictable cycles. We have already witnessed this pattern with a bull run in 2017 giving way to a multi-year bear trend, before the huge surge in 2020-21. Now, as crypto winter sets in, savvy investors know that the best time to buy is when there is “blood in the streets.”
History has shown patience pays off handsomely for those accumulating top-tier crypto assets when prices are depressed. When the next wave of institutional and retail adoption comes, supply squeezes for scarce assets like Bitcoin will drive prices higher. Leading smart contract platforms like Ethereum will also benefit from further mainstream utilization in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, metaverse and Web3 applications.
This article highlights 5 of the most promising cryptocurrencies to add to your portfolio during the 2023 bear market. With fundamental development continuing apace despite price declines, our recommended crypto assets are prime to generate tremendous upside for investors with long time horizons. Periods of fear and uncertainty often provide the greatest opportunities – the forward-thinking will stake their claims now and reap substantial rewards during the next bull cycle.
Crypton‘s association with the Utopia P2P ecosystem makes it uniquely positioned for long-term success. Utopia is a decentralized network built for private, secure communication and data transmission. All financial transactions within the ecosystem are conducted using Crypton.
As a privacy coin, Crypton offers complete anonymity and untraceability for transactions. This is accomplished through cryptographic signing and encryption to protect against fraud and ensure the security of funds. For cryptocurrency investors and users concerned about privacy, Crypton checks all the right boxes.
The instant, irreversible settlement of Crypton transactions also makes it attractive as a payment method. Merchants and vendors can benefit from fast transaction times without the risk of reversal. These are advantages Crypton has over traditional fiat currency payment rails.
Crypton can also be earned through mining to support the Utopia network infrastructure. This promotes greater decentralization and alignment of incentives. Miners earn newly minted Crypton as well as interest on their balances, providing recurring yield.
Importantly, Crypton has a real-world use case powering the Utopia ecosystem. It is not just an abstract investment asset. Adoption of Utopia for private communication and transactions will drive Demand for Crypton over time.
For cryptocurrency investors interested in privacy, security, speed, and an associated ecosystem, Crypton checks all the boxes. As Utopia continues growing, it represents an asymmetric opportunity compared to other crypto assets. For these reasons, Crypton is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to invest in for the long-term.
AQLA is designed to capitalize on the massive and rapidly growing carbon offset market, estimated to reach $250 billion by Morgan Stanley. With global carbon emissions continuing to rise, the need for carbon offsets and mitigation projects will only increase in the coming years.
AQLA aims to bring credibility and transparency to carbon offsets by recording them on its blockchain platform. This provides tamper-proof verification of the offsets and allows them to be tokenized and traded efficiently. The blockchain approach solves key issues like double-counting and verification that have hindered the offset market’s growth.
The project has a global vision of promoting awareness and enabling businesses to adopt carbon neutral practices. As climate change concerns grow, this first-mover advantage in the blockchain carbon space gives AQLA huge room for adoption. Its standards and methodologies align with major international climate agreements as well.
Additionally, AQLA is actively developing real-world use cases in voluntary carbon markets to back green technologies. This creates utility and demand for the AQLA token beyond just speculation. The wider applicability in ESG solutions also expands its total addressable market.
With environmental sustainability becoming increasingly important worldwide, AQLA is a purpose-built solution catering to massive needs. Its blockchain platform and token allow climate action to scale exponentially. For investors, getting in early with AQLA provides exposure to a rapidly expanding space. The project’s sustainability focus also gives it an ethical edge over other crypto offerings.

On-Chain Data Shows Increased Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) Accumulation Among Whales;"The post On-Chain Data Shows Increased Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) Accumulation Among Whales appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) has seen more large transactions than ever since March.
Santiment noted in a tweet that WBTC whale transfers above $1 million are spiking to their highest rate since March. WBTC also saw its most significant network growth since July and a jump in new wallets holding 1-1,000 WBTC.
 #WrappedBitcoin is seeing its highest rate of $1M+ whale transactions since March, highest network growth since July, and a notable spike in 1-1K $WBTC wallets created. Similar increases were seen just prior to both the March and June #crypto rallies. https://t.co/wjiwLWNXki pic.twitter.com/dU4nTQ1oN4
The firm said similar on-chain shifts preceded rallies in March and June this year. The data suggests heightened whale accumulation and interest in the Bitcoin proxy ahead of the potential crypto market upside.
Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) has experienced notable transaction activity on several occasions. On July 1, 2023, the transaction volume of WBTC surged to over 7,000, marking the second significant spike in just over two months. On August 2, 2023, two substantial transfers of 2,000 WBTC each impacted the overall supply of WBTC on exchanges.
WBTC plays a crucial role in enabling the use of Bitcoin in smart contracts and enhancing the accessibility of the world’s largest cryptocurrency on decentralized exchanges (DEX).
Meanwhile, analyst Charles Edwards highlighted in another tweet that Bitcoin’s long-term holder supply is expanding comparably to 2016 levels.
Edwards believes this increase in holders will have major consequences in 2024, more akin to the 2017 bull run’s 10x price gains versus 2020’s run. This strengthening holder base reflects a step-change in accumulation.
The on-chain insights indicate heightened conviction in Bitcoin among both whale traders and long-term investors.
Key metrics like exchange reserves, active addresses, and transaction volumes further affirm accumulation is occurring at pivotal support around $20,000. The blockchain data shows holders are positioning for the next bull run.

Bitdeer grows Bitcoin production by 195% YoY with a 35% September increase in BTC mined;"Singapore-based Bitdeer Technologies Group revealed a notable surge in mined Bitcoins in September 2023.
482 Bitcoins were mined, nearly tripling the numbers from the same time last year. Additionally, the Gedu mining data center alone produced 217 Bitcoins, accounting for approximately 45% of the total mined Bitcoins in September.
The increase is primarily attributed to the company’s operational efficiency, strategic business focus, and the stable operations of its newly constructed Gedu mining data center in Bhutan.
Bitdeer CEO Linghui Kong emphasized the company’s operational strength, which yielded robust results, with Bitcoin mining through their self-mining business experiencing an impressive 25.8% increment compared to the previous month.
According to Kong, the firm’s self-mining success is due to Bitdeer maintaining its aggregate electrical capacity at a steady 895MW. Highlighting the broader implications of these operational efficiencies, Kong stated,
“As we move into the remainder of the year, we are confident that our emphasis on strategic business development will bolster our results and help us generate long-term value for our shareholders.”
Beyond self-mining, Bitdeer’s operations span across three main business lines. These include Hash Rate Sharing, primarily involving Cloud Hash Rate, where Bitdeer offers hash rate subscription plans and shares mining income with customers. Hosting is a comprehensive mining machine hosting solution inclusive of deployment, maintenance, and management services for efficient cryptocurrency mining.
Bitdeer’s operations update indicated that the total hash rate under management as of Sep. 30 was 21.2 EH/s across the three primary business lines, with the proprietary hash rate at 8.7 EH/s. Bitdeer has 221,000 mining machines under management.
Bitdeer is not only expanding its Bitcoin mining capabilities but also its infrastructure. The company is steadily constructing a 175MW immersion cooling data center at its mining facility in Tydal, Norway. This expansion is part of Bitdeer’s concerted efforts to enhance its infrastructure and expand capacity. Completion of the Tydal Datacenter is expected in 2025.
As an industry player, Bitdeer’s operational updates offer an insightful glimpse into the dynamics of the cryptocurrency mining industry. The firm’s focus on optimizing operations, expanding infrastructure, and engaging in strategic business development is the backbone of its growth, offering valuable lessons for other organizations in the crypto space.
With mining data centers deployed in the United States, Norway, and Bhutan, Bitdeer continues providing its customers with comprehensive digital asset mining solutions.

Bitcoin Stopped at $28K, Toncoin Explodes 9% Daily (Market Watch);"Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down the $28,000 mark but was quickly stopped in its tracks and has returned to $27,500.
Most altcoins are trading sideways, with ADA and SOL gaining a few percentages, while ETH and BNB have retraced slightly.
Bitcoin initiated a massive leg up at the start of the week after a slow weekend that drove it from $27,000 to a multi-week peak at $28,600. As the community was anticipating the restart of the bull run, the cryptocurrency started losing value.
In a matter of a day, the asset lost just over a grand and went back below $27,500 until Thursday. That’s when another offensive arrived, and BTC soared to just over $28,000.
Nevertheless, it failed to continue upwards once again. The subsequent rejection pushed it back down by nearly a grand this time. As a result, bitcoin currently trades at around $27,500.
Its market capitalization has lost some ground, expectedly, and is down below $540 billion on CMC. its dominance over the altcoins, on the other hand, has increased slightly to 49.6%.
As reported yesterday, Toncoin, which was a massive gainer at the end of September, had lost its momentum with the start of the new month. However, the trending altcoin has gone back on the offensive in the past 24 hours. TON is up by approximately 9%, which has helped it reclaim the $2 mark.
Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and Avalanche are also slightly in the green. In fact, AVAX has jumped by about 4% and now stands firmly above $10.
In contrast, ETH, BNB, XRP, and TRX have registered minor losses. Overall, though, most larger-cap alts are relatively stable on a daily scale.
Consequently, the total crypto market cap has remained still at around $1.080 trillion on CMC.

Assessing Cardano’s Struggles: Will Key Support Levels Halt The Decline Above $0.27?;"Cardano (ADA) has been on a rollercoaster ride in the cryptocurrency market, with its recent price recovery rally encountering some significant challenges. 
As of the latest data from CoinGecko, ADA is trading at $0.261, showing a modest 1.7% gain in the past 24 hours, but boasting a seven-day rally of 4.9%. However, beneath the surface, there are signs of growing overhead pressure that could limit ADA’s upward momentum.
ADA’s journey to reclaim its previous highs faces its first major hurdle at the $0.26 mark. But this is just the beginning, as multiple layers of resistance lie above it, signifying significant supplier congestion levels. The price recovery may be stalling due to these formidable barriers.
To gain a deeper understanding of ADA’s current price dynamics, we turn to a new price analysis. Data reveals a crucial level of buying interest at $0.25. In fact, over 600,000 ADA buy limit orders are placed at this level. 
This suggests that if ADA can breach the range-high and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), it might find support around the mid-range of $0.25.
On the sell side, key sell limit orders start to emerge between $0.265 and $0.270, indicating that there is substantial selling pressure just above the current price levels.

The fate of ADA’s price also hinges on Bitcoin’s performance. Should Bitcoin post losses and dip below $27,500, ADA could follow suit, potentially finding support at the mid-range of $0.25. Conversely, a bullish rally in Bitcoin could set the stage for ADA to re-target its next hurdle at $0.28.
Technical indicators are also raising caution flags for ADA investors. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50 level and trending downward, indicating fading momentum. Furthermore, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in negative territory, signaling a lack of bullish sentiment.

Considering the current market conditions and technical indicators, analysts are leaning towards a bearish outlook for Cardano’s price. There is a possibility that ADA could descend to test the support floor at $0.2415. In a worst-case scenario, the price could plummet further, potentially reaching the range low of $0.2200, marking a substantial 15% drop from its current levels.
While Cardano has shown resilience with its recent gains, the road ahead is riddled with resistance levels, and Bitcoin’s influence remains a significant factor. Investors should closely monitor the developments in ADA’s price, as it navigates through these challenging market conditions. The cryptocurrency landscape is as unpredictable as ever, and ADA’s journey is far from certain.

"Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025!";"The post Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The bitcoin price trend is no less than ‘hot pancakes’ which is gaining global attention. The rise or fall in price is not restricted to demand and supply, as the institutions and whales, along with the market makers, do have a significant impact on it. After the collapse of Terra & FTX, the markets appeared to be uncertain and not in recovery mode for the next few months. However, the emergence of institutions in the crypto space lifted the momentum, which made the market participants optimistic about the future growth of the BTC price and the entire market.
It’s more clear that Bitcoin is fueling up for one of the most phenomenal runs in history. The major reason for being bullish on Bitcoin could be:
Considering these factors, industry experts believe the BTC price may witness a huge bull run over the next 18 months. After claiming a huge inflow of $150B to $200B in Bitcoin through the BlackRock ETF, the director of the firm is now confident of all the ETFs being approved in the next 3 to 6 months. This may transform the entire crypto space, with an elevated attention and adoption rate. 
With the growing confidence of investors and market participants, can the BTC price make it to $50,000 in 2024?
Analyzing the impact of the spot ETFs on the BTC price, a popular crypto proponent and influencer, tedtalksmacro, shared some context. Presently, the FDV, or fully diluted value, of Bitcoin, which is a product of maximum supply and current market price, is around $580 billion amidst the depths of the bear market and the regulatory tightening of the global central banks.
If the token forms a strong base around the current price, the next leg after the ETFs could elevate the FDV to around $780 billion, which is around $37,100 per BTC. Additionally, the central banks are estimated to ease their tight vigilance in the next 12 to 24 months, which may make the markets more optimistic, which may add up to a much higher speculative premium.
If all these go well and BTC market capitalisation moves back to $1 trillion, then the price may rise to $48,000 in late 2025 or early 2026. The analysis depends on speculations and assumptions, and many more are yet to come. However, positive sentiments continue to mount up expecting a similar price rise that happened with Gold since 2004 after the SPDR ETF.

The bitcoin price trend is no less than ‘hot pancakes’ which is gaining global attention. The rise or fall in price is not restricted to demand and supply, as the institutions and whales, along with the market makers, do have a significant impact on it. After the collapse of Terra & FTX, the markets appeared to be uncertain and not in recovery mode for the next few months. However, the emergence of institutions in the crypto space lifted the momentum, which made the market participants optimistic about the future growth of the BTC price and the entire market.
It’s more clear that Bitcoin is fueling up for one of the most phenomenal runs in history. The major reason for being bullish on Bitcoin could be:
Considering these factors, industry experts believe the BTC price may witness a huge bull run over the next 18 months. After claiming a huge inflow of $150B to $200B in Bitcoin through the BlackRock ETF, the director of the firm is now confident of all the ETFs being approved in the next 3 to 6 months. This may transform the entire crypto space, with an elevated attention and adoption rate. 
With the growing confidence of investors and market participants, can the BTC price make it to $50,000 in 2024?

LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100? ;"The post LTC Price Analysis: Will Litecoin Trigger A Jump To $100?  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Taking a sharp correction from $114 to $57 between July and September, the LTC coin price brings a death cross. Taking a sideway step to avoid further correction, the Litecoin price made an inverted head and shoulders pattern with a neckline close to the $70 mark. 
Despite such sharp correction, the market sentiments expect positive outcomes and present optimistic Litecoin price predictions.
However, the overhead supply pressure moving along with the 50-day EMA nullifies the breakout possibility by forcing the LTC price back to the $60 support zone. Currently, the LTC price aims to form a morning star pattern to ignite the positive cycle from the crucial support zone. 
As of now, LTC price is trading at $65.41 with an intraday growth of 0.93%, highlighting a reversal possibility. This positive reversal will challenge the 50-day EMA and might cross the $70 support zone to give a bullish breakout. 
Moreover, the chances of a reversal in LTC price are increasing as the overall market enters the Uptober season.
However, the lack of trend momentum and significant overhead supply warns of a consolidation range or a further correction.
Technical indicators:
DMI indicator: The ADX line is still on a downward trend, indicating a low momentum phase for Litecoin. However, the bullish turnaround in the DI lines suggests a high probability of a breakout to the upside.
EMA: Rising above the 50-day EAMA will be critical for Litecoin price to continue the recovery rally. 
Considering the Litecoin momentum increases with the Bitcoin ETF decision this October, the altcoin may form a new swing high. If the LTC price exceeds the 50-day EMA, it will highlight a bullish entry spot for sideline traders. Moreover, the 50-day EMA breakout will challenge the $70 mark before reaching the psychological mark of $100.
Alternatively, if the downtrend persists, it might break $60 to test the bullish dominance at the $50 support level.

Analyst Nicholas Merten Issues Bitcoin Alert, Says BTC Headed for a ‘Really Difficult Time’ – Here’s Why;"Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten is warning of a risk that Bitcoin (BTC) faces in the current macroeconomic environment.
Merten tells his 512,000 YouTube subscribers that over the long term, Bitcoin is going to experience a “really difficult time” as liquidity tightens.
According to the widely followed crypto analyst, Bitcoin’s price direction is heavily determined by monetary policy.
“We cannot sit here and say that Bitcoin is this hedge against money supply debasement and that it should go up when there’s new money in the system like it has been for the past decade, and then simply ignore when it’s [money supply] contracting.
Bitcoin works in the opposite effect here. It hedges that money debasement to the upside – when you print more money, Bitcoin’s value should obviously increase to some degree. And during periods of times of monetary contraction, it should struggle. It should generally be moving lower here to the downside…
Liquidity is the lifeline, it is the blood of all financial assets to continue appreciating.”
According to Merten, while Bitcoin has demonstrated some resiliency over the past couple of months, that could change if sentiment turns bearish.
“If investors who are buying up here [the $25,000 – $32,000 range], who are providing that current support while some people are selling, if they don’t see that there are enough other bulls on the market who are willing to market buy alongside them and eat up the asks on the order book and continue pushing prices higher… 
If all those who have been market buying for the past couple of months realize that there’s really not enough momentum to clear through this prior support range that’s now acting as the resistance between $28,000 and $32,000, people are going to start cashing out.”
Bitcoin is trading at $27,715 at time of writing.

Shielding Your Digital Realm: How to Protect Yourself and Crypto From SIM Swap Attacks;"In 2023, several SIM swap attacks have targeted cryptocurrency advocates and high-profile industry members, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Below is a comprehensive guide aimed at educating our readers on mitigating SIM swap attacks and safeguarding against hacks.
Recently, Bitcoin.com News reported that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin fell victim to a SIM swap attack. Moreover, this week, an Ethereum (ETH) investor suffered a SIM swap attack, losing 22 ETH on the friend.tech blockchain social media platform, which operates on the Base network. Unfortunately, a significant number of SIM swap attacks are targeting crypto investors. The subsequent walkthrough will guide our readers on how to avert a SIM swap attack.

So, what is a SIM swap attack? A SIM swap attack is a type of fraud in which a malicious actor deceives a mobile carrier into transferring the victim’s phone number to a new SIM card controlled by the attacker. Once the phone number is transferred, the attacker can receive the victim’s calls and text messages, including sensitive authentication codes sent via SMS for two-factor authentication (2FA).

This breach enables the attacker to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to the victim’s online accounts, such as email, crypto exchange accounts, and social media profiles, leading to potential financial loss and identity theft. While mitigation efforts are never 100% effective, there are several strategies individuals can employ to combat SIM swap breaches.
The first step is essentially online vigilance by being cautious of phishing emails and other tactics used by attackers to gain access to your personal information. Further enhanced vigilance includes avoiding responses to suspicious communications such as unknown texts, emails, and phone calls. The second measure is to leverage strong and unique passwords that protect each online account. Third, the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended, and veering away from an SMS text message or email-based 2FA is also advisable. It’s wise to use stronger multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods such as standalone authentication applications, biometrics, or physical security keys.
Another protective method, and one of the most important, is to engage in security measures by contacting your telephone carrier. With specific carriers, you can request additional security measures on your account. Users can also establish a unique PIN or passcode with their carrier, which adds an extra layer of security. Some telephone line carriers offer SIM protection features that add extra security to prevent SIM swap fraud. If you don’t contact your telephone carrier, you may miss out on some of the security measures that could prevent a SIM swap attack.
Another measure is to avoid using your telephone number for social media applications like X (formerly Twitter) and other online platforms and applications. Alongside your phone number, be cautious about sharing personal information online as every piece of evidence a hacker can gather is useful to crack online accounts. For services that require a phone number for verification or communication, consider using a secondary number or a virtual phone number service like Google Voice.
By following these steps, you can avoid a SIM swap attack and protect your finances and personal information. SIM-swapping attacks have been increasing in frequency in recent years, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning in March 2023 about the rise of SIM-swapping attacks, which have resulted in millions of dollars in losses.

BNB Price Prediction – Bears Aim Nasty Drop Below $200, Here’s Why;"BNB price (Binance coin) is still struggling to clear the $220 resistance against the US Dollar. The price could decline heavily below the $210 and $202 support levels.
This past week, BNB price attempted a recovery wave above the $210 level. The price was able to clear the $215 resistance zone. However, it failed to clear the $220 resistance.
There was a fresh decline in BNB, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price declined below the $215 support level. The bears pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high.
Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $214.5 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $215 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
It is consolidating near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $207 swing low to the $221 high. If there is a recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $213 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).

The next resistance sits near the $215 level. A clear move above the $215 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test the main resistance at $220-$222. A close above the $222 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance.
If BNB fails to clear the $215 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $210 level. The next major support is near the $207 level.
If there is a downside break below the $207 support, the price could drop toward the $202 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $165 level.

Binance Exchange Spot Market Share Falls to 34%: A Closer Look;"The post Binance Exchange Spot Market Share Falls to 34%: A Closer Look appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Binance, once the dominant force in the cryptocurrency exchange space, has experienced a seven-month decline in its spot market share, which now stands at just 34%, according to CCData, as reported by Bloomberg. 
Since August, Binance has seen withdrawals totaling around $12,230 BTC, or $330 million, and around 198,200 Ethereum (ETH), or $323 million. Bitcoin constitutes nearly half the $1 trillion crypto industry, while Ether accounts for about 20%.
However, as per K33 research, Binance’s trading volumes have also plummeted, with a 57% decline in the 7-day average trading volume for Bitcoin since the beginning of September. In contrast, other exchanges, including U.S.-based Coinbase, have maintained more stable volumes, with Coinbase experiencing a 9% increase over the same period. 
Several factors have contributed to this decline. Binance’s move to offer zero-fee trading for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to attract more users and boost trading volumes initially helped the exchange. However, it has since lost its appeal as these promotions ended. This shift has led some users to explore alternative platforms.
Binance’s Legal portions have further exacerbated Binance’s troubles. The CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), faces potential criminal charges from the U.S. Justice Department, and the company has witnessed high-profile executive departures and significant layoffs, causing concerns about its future market position. 
But not all are against Binance; recently, Changpeng Zhao’s optimistic statements about the success of his Initial Coin Offering (ICO) garnered positive attention. The tokens, initially valued at 15 cents each, are now trading at $213, having reached as high as $675 in 2021. 
Currently, the BNB coin ranks as the fourth-most valuable digital asset globally, with a market worth of $33 billion. According to Forbes, Zhao’s net worth is estimated at $10 billion, but this calculation is based on the value of his business interests. It does not include the substantial amount of BNB he likely controls. 
So we can say Binance is still in the race despite a 0.87% drop in trading volume; Binance leads with $188.20 billion and 50.79% market share. Whereas the top 8 platforms controlled 91.7% of market depth and 89.5% of trading volume.
Still, cryptocurrency-related happenings will determine the crypto market’s future growth trajectory. The market has become dominated by news of the introduction of bitcoin ETFs and the selling pressure of insolvent corporations and the US government.

Currently, the BNB coin ranks as the fourth-most valuable digital asset globally, with a market worth of $33 billion. According to Forbes, Zhao’s net worth is estimated at $10 billion, but this calculation is based on the value of his business interests. It does not include the substantial amount of BNB he likely controls. 
So we can say Binance is still in the race despite a 0.87% drop in trading volume; Binance leads with $188.20 billion and 50.79% market share. Whereas the top 8 platforms controlled 91.7% of market depth and 89.5% of trading volume.
Still, cryptocurrency-related happenings will determine the crypto market’s future growth trajectory. The market has become dominated by news of the introduction of bitcoin ETFs and the selling pressure of insolvent corporations and the US government.

Ethereum Price At Risk of Sharp Decline Unless ETH Clears This Heavy Resistance;"Ethereum price is slowly moving lower toward the $1,585 support against the US dollar. ETH must clear the $1,650 resistance to start a recovery wave.
Ethereum attempted a recovery wave from the $1,630 zone. ETH climbed above the $1,650 resistance level but upsides were limited, like Bitcoin.
The price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $1,665 resistance level. A high was formed near $1,654 and the price reacted to the downside. It declined below the $1,620 support and even traded close to the $1,600 level. A low is formed near $1,607 and the price is now consolidating losses.
Ethereum is now trading below $1,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,645 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.
On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,630 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,654 swing high to the $1,607 low. The next major resistance is $1,650, the trend line, and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
The trend line is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,654 swing high to the $1,607 low. A close above the $1,650 resistance might send the price toward the key resistance at $1,665.

Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com
To start a steady increase, Ether must settle above the $1,650 and $1,665 levels. The next key resistance might be $1,720. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750.
If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,650 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,610 level. The next key support is $1,600.
The first major support is now near $1,585. A downside break below the $1,585 support might start another strong decline. In the stated case, the price could decline toward the $1,540 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,500 level.
Technical Indicators
Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.
Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.

This Hasn’t Happened to Ethereum Since 2018;"TL;DR


As revealed by the blockchain analytics platform Santiment, the amount of Ether (ETH) that currently sits on cryptocurrency exchanges has dropped to 10.66 million coins. The last time the figure was that low was in May 2018. On the contrary, 115.88M ETH is situated outside centralized platforms, which is an all-time high mark.
Santiment further estimated that approximately 110,000 ETH (worth over $180 million) moved off of exchanges on October 4, marking the largest outflow day since August 21. 
 #Ethereum saw about ~110K $ETH ($181M) move off of exchanges Wednesday, the largest outflow day since August 21st. The amount of non-exchange Ethereum now sits at an #AllTimeHigh 115.88M $ETH, while its exchange supply is at its lowest in ~5.5 years. https://t.co/PUOWGt0KS0 pic.twitter.com/u54pp6LZij
— Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 5, 2023
Such moves are typically seen as bullish for the asset’s valuation since they reduce selling pressure and show investors’ long-term convictions. 
As CryptoPotato recently reported, the situation with the primary cryptocurrency is quite similar. The supply of Bitcoin (BTC) on cryptocurrency exchanges has slipped to 5.73%, or a 5-year low. 
On another note, sharks and whales have been pretty active, accumulating quantities of the asset at an increased temp in the past few months. Most recent data suggests that such investors control more than 66% of the circulating supply of BTC.
The top 1% of Bitcoin addresses are much privileged, holding almost 19.3 million coins (out of 19.5 million that have been produced so far). Those interested to see who are the six BTC billionaires can watch our video below:

Kraken Expanding In Europe Despite MiCA, To Acquire Dutch Broker;"Kraken, one of the world’s oldest crypto exchanges, is strengthening its presence in Europe and plans to buy Coin Meester B.V. (BCM), a Dutch crypto broker. In a press release on October 5, Kraken said the purchase would give them a “sizable position in the Dutch market” and benefit the broker’s clients.
BCM supports over 170 digital assets and is one of the oldest brokers in the country. By acquiring BCM, Kraken is asserting its commitment to expand across Europe. The exchange plans to expand its product line, increase liquidity, and improve security for a broader user base.
Kraken CEO David Ripley said:
The Netherlands has one of the world’s most advanced economies, with a well-established culture of innovation and a high level of crypto adoption. This makes it a key market for us in our European expansion plans. The acquisition of BCM will give Kraken a sizable position in the Dutch market. It will allow BCM’s clients to benefit from an even more robust product offering.
Kraken said they are buoyed by the European Commission’s introduction of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. MiCA seeks to bring comprehensive crypto regulation to the European Union (EU). 
These rules aim to standardize the regulatory environment for various crypto assets, including fungible assets like Ethereum (ETH) or Bitcoin (BTC) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
Nonetheless, the European Union has claimed that MiCA’s primary objective is to protect consumers and investors by mitigating risks associated with crypto, including hacks and rug pulls while promoting financial stability and market integrity. 
By establishing clear rules and requirements for crypto businesses and market participants, MiCA aims to “level the playing field,” even fostering innovation. MiCA took effect on June 1, 2023. Its full implementation will be in 2024. 
As a result of these developments, crypto firms and exchanges, such as Binance France, are closely watching MiCA’s implementation. In late August, Binance France said the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) license presented “an opportunity to adapt to regulatory challenges and capitalize on opportunities within the European market.”
In Europe, Kraken has already obtained an Electronic Money Institution license from the Central Bank of Ireland and a virtual asset service provider (VASP) registration from the Bank of Spain. With the Irish license, Kraken can offer euro-to-crypto trading services in the EU.

SBF Trial Day 3 – Former FTX CTO claims SBF granted Alameda Research ‘special privileges’ during witness testimony;"The third day of the trial against Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) unveiled deeper insights into the company’s financial operations and its founder’s personal habits.
In the morning session, testimony from Adam Yedidia, a college acquaintance of Bankman-Fried and a former Alameda and FTX staff member, provided a glimpse into the backend operations of FTX.
Yedidia delved into his work automating customer deposits and withdrawals, revealing a glitch that inflated FTX’s fiat@ftx.com account by a whopping $8 billion.
The prosecution shifted the court’s attention to the stark contrast between FTX’s original Hong Kong offices, which were extremely simple compared to the opulent offices and paddle tennis court in the Bahamas. Emphasizing signs of opulence, the prosecution also put forward images of SBF’s penthouse.
The defense countered the opulence argument by claiming that the penthouse was a shared living arrangement, while the offices were a sign of the crypto market’s success during that period. They added that SBF did not own a yacht and drove a Toyota Corolla, arguing that he led a simple life and the prosecution’s claims of opulence were unfounded.
An anecdote about SBF’s preference for sleeping on a bean bag chair in Hong Kong, which occasionally turned into naps in the Bahamas, provided a lighter moment in the proceedings.
The afternoon session was marked by Matt Huang’s testimony, co-founder of Paradigm, a significant investor in FTX. Huang’s testimony highlighted his concerns about FTX’s lack of a traditional governance structure and potential favorable conditions for Alameda Research.
Gary Wang, FTX’s Chief Technology Officer, admitted to financial misconduct during his tenure at FTX during his testimony. He further discussed specific privileges allegedly granted to Alameda Research on SBF’s instruction.
Judge Lewis Kaplan didn’t shy away from intervening, reproaching the defense on several occasions for repetitive lines of questioning, especially during Yedidia’s cross-examination.
Off the stand, the day was peppered with mentions of a book, “Number Go Up” by Zeke Faux, which narrates SBF’s descent in the crypto industry.
The trial, drawing national attention, is set to continue with Wang’s testimony and indications from the prosecution that subsequent witnesses will include industry heavyweights like BlockFi CEO Zac Prince and Elan Dekel from Pinecone.
Federal prosecutors have targeted two private jets, a Bombardier Global 5000 and an Embraer Legacy, linked to cryptocurrency executive Sam Bankman-Fried.
The aircraft, worth a combined $70 million, might be confiscated due to its connection to alleged illicit activities by Bankman-Fried. The crypto executive, who is currently on trial, has denied all charges against him.
US-based employees of FTX reportedly discovered a secret backdoor in the exchange’s system that allowed Alameda Research to access customer funds.
This revelation has raised concerns and skepticism, especially with Alameda’s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, and other executives acknowledging the use of these funds.
Creditors of the now-bankrupt FTX are optimistic as Google considers a $2B investment in AI firm Anthropic. Previously, FTX and Alameda Research had invested a combined $500M in Anthropic.
If this new investment comes to fruition, it could significantly raise the value of FTX’s stake, aiding in compensating the exchange’s defunct users.
The individual responsible for exploiting FTX has converted another $25M of stolen Ethereum to Bitcoin. The conversion was executed via THORChain Router, with the exploiter now having converted a total of $100M since the hack in January 2023.
These moves have coincided with the commencement of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial, sparking speculation that an insider may have been involved in the hack.

Grayscale Pursues Groundbreaking SEC Approval for Spot Ethereum ETF;"Amid the soaring interest in digital assets, Grayscale Investment, a prominent name in the cryptocurrency space, has stepped forward with a monumental move. The company recently approached the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to transform its dominant Ethereum Trust, known as ETHE, into a Spot Ethereum ETF. This move is emblematic of the rising interest in and legitimization of cryptocurrency within traditional financial sectors
As 2023 unfolds, the buzz around exchange-traded funds (ETFs) related to digital assets has been growing louder. Giants from the traditional finance realm like BlackRock and Fidelity have already dipped their toes into the Bitcoin ETF waters. The modern digital asset industry is witnessing a paradigm shift, and Grayscale’s latest move reinforces this trend.
While Bitcoin ETFs have captured significant attention, Grayscale’s innovative approach marks a divergence. Their goal? To focus on Ethereum – another heavyweight in the crypto arena. Having submitted their application to the SEC, Grayscale aims to metamorphose their Ethereum Trust into a Spot ETH ETF. It’s worth noting that this trust isn’t a small player; it manages assets nearing the $5 billion mark.
Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale‘s visionary CEO, commented on this pivotal shift. He was quoted by Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas saying, “It’s a natural progression for the product.” Sonnenshein further elaborated, “This signifies a decisive moment to broaden Ethereum’s embrace within the regulatory framework of the US.”

Taking a trip down memory lane, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust isn’t a recent venture. Launched back in 2019, it quickly ascended to the ranks of an SEC-reporting entity in 2020. In the wake of a significant legal victory against the SEC earlier this year, the company is also hoping for a green light on their proposal to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a Spot Bitcoin ETF.
Grayscale’s move represents more than just an isolated business decision; it’s indicative of the broader trajectory of the crypto market. As financial instruments evolve, traditional institutions and regulators are being prompted to adapt and innovate. The outcome of Grayscale’s application could set a precedent for the future of Ethereum-based financial products.

‘Keep an Eye’ on Bitcoin Cash (BCH), These Three Altcoins as One Key Metric Hits a Three-Month High: Santiment;"A handful of altcoins are seeing a “major surge” in address activity, according to the crypto analytics firm Santiment.
The firm notes that Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Smooth Love Potion (SLP), Mask Network (MASK) and Civic Pass (CVC) have all hit three-month highs in terms of daily active address counts.
Bitcoin Cash, a Bitcoin (BTC) hard fork that spun off from the top crypto asset back in 2017, is trading at $229.66 at time of writing. The 17th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 2% in the past 24 hours.

ThorChain Hits Record-Setting $355 Million Trading Volume in a Day;"ThorChain, a decentralized liquidity protocol, reported a record-breaking transaction volume on Oct. 5, with the number surging to $355 million in a single day, marking an all-time high.
This noteworthy event is part of a larger trend as the cumulative transaction volume over the past five days has surpassed the $1 billion mark.
According to the analysis, the surge in transaction volume coincided with the rise in swap counts associated with the network. On Oct. 5, when the transaction volume was close to $355 million, the count of swaps related to the network was 115,630.
This was an upward surge compared to the preceding day, when the swap count was 61,877, and the total volume was merely $170.8 million.
The daily change in transaction volume from Oct. 4 to Oct. 5 was a massive 107.6% increase.
A look at the charts indicates an upward trajectory in the transaction volumes since Sept. 29. While the network reported just about $34.45 million as total volume on Sept. 29, the value increased to $60.14 million the next day and $166.4 by Oct. 1.
Later, on Oct. 2, the total transaction volume made a new high of $197.33 million before minor plunges were noted at $173.84 million and $170.84 million between Oct. 3 and 4, respectively. Between Oct. 1 and 5, the cumulative transaction volume was $1.063 billion.
As the transaction volumes seemingly surged, so did the earnings volume associated with the network. On Oct. 4, the liquidity earning was about $109K, and the bond earning stood at $66.7K, a major decline from the highs recorded on Oct. 2. However, on Oct. 5, the liquidity and bond earnings stood at $164.35K and $101.96K, respectively.
As per analysts, the sudden volume surge can be linked to increased hacking activities recently, especially with cross-chain BTC transactions being the main contributor to the massive volume surge.
To address these adverse events, reports indicate that ThorSwap, a product of ThorChain, has paused the platform, shifting into maintenance mode.
When speaking of the developments, ThorSwap developer tweeted;
“Yesterday, following a careful evaluation of the situation and consultation with advisors, legal counsel, and law enforcement, the decision was made to temporarily transition the THORSwap interface into maintenance mode. This action was taken to swiftly curtail any further potential illicit activity.”
Fellow THORChads,
A pressing and persistent concern has recently come to light: the potential movement of illicit funds through THORChain and, specifically, THORSwap. Such activities have no place on the THORSwap platform, and THORSwap stands firmly against any and all criminal…
— THORSwap  #BetterThanCEX (@THORSwap) October 6, 2023

The tweet noted that ThorSwap will remain in this mode till the developers find a more permanent solution to implement and bolster the platform’s continued security and integrity.
The native token of the ThorChain network, Rune, has been trading in the red for most of the past 24 hours. Starting the day at 2.048, the token surged to $2.1 before plunging to a low of about $1.93. Reports indicate that the token has lost about 2,51% in value in the 24 hours from October 5 till the reporting time.
However, the story is quite different in the past seven days, with Rune trading in the green. Starting at $1.92 on Sept. 29, Rune surged to a high of $2.23 on Oct. 2 before falling to a low of $1.88 on Oct. 4.
The charts suggest that the assets have mainly shown a sideways price action, especially in the past five days. However, in the past week, Rune has gained about 3.02% in value.

‘Trading Through Gamification Can Represent the Future’ Says Banksters’ Alexandru Carbunariu;"While centralized exchanges (cexs) are instrumental in helping new users grasp all things crypto, they nevertheless do not go “the extra mile in educating their audience properly,” Alexandru Carbunariu, the CMO at the edutech simulator Banksters, has asserted. According to Carbunariu, a Web3 advisor, properly educating newbies includes making the experience more interactive and fun. He added that Web3 platforms should take a leaf out of their Web2 counterparts’ playbook.
Expanding on the argument that education should be more fun, the CMO said he concurred with those who believe gamification to be the right way of encouraging more positive trading behavior. However, Carbunariu told Bitcoin.com News that while “trading through gamification may represent the future,” many of the current Web3 games may “have taken a wrong turn.”
When asked for his thoughts on the so-called trade-to-win strategy, the Banksters CMO insisted that such a model is better than play-to-earn (P2E) models because it engenders confidence. He suggested that such a model can be ideal for newcomers. Meanwhile, in written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, Carbunariu also articulated why competition is necessary for Web3 platforms looking to get communities attached to their respective products.
Below are Alexandru Carbunariu‘s responses to all questions sent.
Bitcoin.com News (BCN): Centralized exchanges (cexs) are one of the gateways to all things crypto for new users and most of them have taken on the job of educating newcomers. In your opinion, what can they do better or differently to bring in more Web2 users via education?
Alexandru Carbunariu (AC): Speaking from experience, centralized exchanges don’t take the extra mile in educating their audience properly. A lot more things should be done in terms of education, to make it more fun, more rewarding as well as more interactive. We should check what Web2 asset platforms do and get inspired by their work. We rarely see that in Web3. However, we believe that with new regulations, specific training models will come up.
What needs to be done in order to attract Web2 users:
Create interactive training that will provide incentives (like we have seen Revolut doing).
Use normal KOLs [key opinion leaders] to present their products in a transparent [way] but also using normal non-technical language.
Try to introduce academy programs, where normal users can attend, therefore the knowledge will be much higher. Provide transparency when involving risks. Introduce alerts when the user is lost in the complex UX / UI of the platform.
BCN: Do you believe gamification is the right approach to encouraging positive crypto trading behavior with long-term benefits?
AC: Of course. Creating a more fun environment can be relaxing for the user, and if you don’t mix that with financial loss, it’s actually perfect. We are one of the first to build this type of concept. Our A/B tests, focus groups as well user validation were high, meaning that we were on the right track.
I believe that the Web3 games have taken a wrong turn, and the project owners have lost focus. Web3 should be the gateway to the future and it should provide new ways, apart from the traditional ones, in order to onboard as many users.
Trading through gamification can represent the future. First users need to understand it, then they will trade or invest with caution. If their first experience provides them with losses, then they are unlikely to come back. This is why Banksters has stepped in and is helping them to understand more about crypto, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and trading.

BCN: Can you describe what the trade-to-win model is all about and how this differs from play-to-earn?
AC: In the past 2-3 years we have seen the “P2E” as well as the “P&E” types. One thing they have in common is the fact that they have not identified a balance that will give them a much-needed token stability.
Our Trade2Win model lets the user:
First test the product
Learn about the product
Play around with it
And become a winner
This is the model that provides more confidence, and the rewards will come only at the end, meaning if you are a winner then the rewards will be won. This is a more or less “shadow” plan from the trading world, where you need to practice, learn, trade and then gain profits.
BCN: Trading is an umbrella term that encompasses various strategies based on an individual’s mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors. How does your platform help users figure out an optimal strategy for them through low-risk education?
AC: This is a very good question. To give a more of a straight answer: Yes and No. Basically, we can cover this through our so-called “Abilities” which can be compared with “Superpowers” a hero avatar has in the Web2 games. Abilities actually “copy” what is happening on the real market. There are abilities like:
Elon Musk Tweet
Vitalik’s Support
CZ’s Effect
Market Squeeze
Pump and Dump
Hype
Insider Trade
These are real-life trading events, and in many cases, traders or users don’t understand them. What Banksters did was to analyze all of the historical pricing for these events, develop a price algorithm then infuse them into these Abilities.
Now the user will understand what happens to their portfolio and how it will react when these Abilities are used. This actually provides no risk for the user as well as covers a new mindset, emotional volatility, and other factors.
BCN: Whether it’s crypto trading or something else, competition is often an integral part of that. How is Banksters encouraging competition among users?
AC: They are highly competitive! We often have tournaments and live streams which reward users with real USDT. It drives them to use the product and makes them happy with both the game but also the environment.
We strongly believe that competitions, challenges, tournaments and livestreams definitely help the community being attached to the product, while the team can gather transparent and vital feedback.
BCN: When discussing factors holding back large-scale adoption of crypto, lack of education and intuitive user interface (UI) often get the most attention. However, could it be that we have not had mass adoption because the crypto ecosystem is still struggling to find the product-market fit?
AC: Another good question. The answer is pretty simple. It’s about money. However, it’s more than that. For example:
Users:
A lot of people have lost their hard-earned money during the bear market while listening to the unprepared and uneducated key opinion leaders (KOLs) who often accept to promote projects with no filters.
Project Owners:
If one puts two years and $10,000 in the right way, they could raise between $500,000 and a million dollars while having absolutely no experience in blockchain tech, development, management, marketing, or product growth. This, however, has changed and now a lot of Web2 specialists are entering the Web3 space and I believe the standard will go just higher.
Centralized Exchanges:
Providing crazy leverages, with no education, with no warning, and to top all that with FTX keeping their crypto wallet keys in a Google form.
At the end of the day, human nature had to kick in, meaning something terrible had to happen in order for something to be changed.
I think Web3 has gone through a reset in the past 2-3 years, and now, finally, we can see some highly professional projects with funding resources delivering innovative products. Such projects have higher odds of finding product-market fit and accelerating adoption.

Bitcoin And Crypto Under The Lens As Bond Market Recalls 2008 Crash;"As the global financial landscape witnesses a seismic shift, reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble burst, alarm bells are ringing in the bond market, alerting the Bitcoin and crypto market as well.
Renowned Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Genevieve Roch-Decter, highlighted the striking parallels in a recent tweet, stating, “I can’t believe I am saying this but the slump in 10-year and 30-year bonds is approaching the epic drops we saw in stocks during the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble bust.”
Bloomberg Surveillance’s Lisa Abramowicz reinforces this grim narrative, pointing out that “bonds maturing in 10 years or more have slumped 46% since peaking in March 2020, just shy of the 49% plunge in US stocks in the aftermath of the dot-com bust. The route in 30-year bonds has been even worse, tumbling 53%.”
Onramp, a Bitcoin asset management platform, adds further context by emphasizing the historic nature of the trend. This decline, particularly in bonds with maturities exceeding a decade, harkens back to market downturns like the dot-com bubble collapse. The Federal Reserve’s resolute stance on inflation and a fragile fiscal environment have disrupted the traditional appeal of long-maturity debt, raising questions about the possibility of a debt spiral.
The situation is further complicated by the behavior of the yield curve. Historically, an inverted yield curve has foreshadowed recessions. However, the recent correction has seen a rare “bear steepener,” marked by rising long-term yields. This phenomenon, seen in the past before recessions, raises concerns of an impending economic downturn.
“While some question the yield curve’s reliability as a recession indicator, the current bear steepening suggests that an economic downturn could be imminent. This is particularly concerning given the Fed’s ongoing commitment to restrictive monetary policy, making the situation ripe for potential market volatility and economic uncertainty, “ Dylan LeClair from Onramp notes.
Meanwhile, Barclays’ analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha suggests that only a stock market crash could halt the bond market’s decline. Unlike previous cycles, traditional bond backstops are dwindling, with the Fed shifting from a net buyer to a net seller, and foreign institutional buying slowing.
This highlights the stark disconnect between equity valuations and long-end bond rates, with stocks having significant room for devaluation before bonds stabilize. And if stocks crash, Bitcoin and crypto could be just as affected.
The turmoil in the bond market has far-reaching implications, including its impact on Bitcoin and crypto. Remarkably, the crypto market has never experienced such a situation, but there are general observations of how risk assets have reacted in such environments in the past.
First, rising treasury yields make risk-free returns more attractive, potentially prompting some investors to reallocate capital from risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto to treasury bills. This shift could decrease demand, putting downward pressure on their prices.
Moreover, a sharp rise in 10-year Treasury yields can signal a tighter monetary policy, weighing on risk assets. Higher yields also mean higher borrowing costs, which can impact crypto. When interest rates rise, non-interest-bearing assets like Bitcoin may seem less attractive compared to yield-bearing assets.
A significant increase in Treasury yields can also lead to reduced liquidity in other financial markets, such as the Bitcoin and crypto space. Institutional investors facing liquidity constraints may liquidate more liquid assets like BTC and altcoins causing potential price declines.
Lastly, sharp yield increases can create volatility across various asset classes as investors seek to reduce risk or cover losses elsewhere. Bitcoin and crypto are highly influenced by market sentiment and speculative behavior. The market’s interpretation of rising yields can sway investor behavior, impacting crypto prices.
Accordingly, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, recently predicted:
The 10YR is up another 10% since! […] The Fed wants more unemployment. The job market is still too strong. They’ve raised the expected 2024 rates as a result and the 10YR has broken out to new decade highs. As long as the 10YR is breaking upwards like this, risk assets are going to see further headwinds.
At press time, BTC traded at $27,576.

Bitcoin increasingly accessible as small investors accelerate accumulation;"The investing ecosystem for Bitcoin is witnessing a prominent shift as ‘Bitcoin shrimps,’ a term referring to investors owning less than one Bitcoin, are making notable strides in the accumulation process.
This year has seen a steady increase in this group’s accumulation activities, detectable for the first time in its prominent deep blue color coding. Over this period, the total Bitcoin supply held collectively by this group has reached a marked 1.4 million Bitcoin.

Shielding Your Digital Realm: How to Protect Yourself and Crypto From SIM Swap Attacks;"In 2023, several SIM swap attacks have targeted cryptocurrency advocates and high-profile industry members, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Below is a comprehensive guide aimed at educating our readers on mitigating SIM swap attacks and safeguarding against hacks.
Recently, Bitcoin.com News reported that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin fell victim to a SIM swap attack. Moreover, this week, an Ethereum (ETH) investor suffered a SIM swap attack, losing 22 ETH on the friend.tech blockchain social media platform, which operates on the Base network. Unfortunately, a significant number of SIM swap attacks are targeting crypto investors. The subsequent walkthrough will guide our readers on how to avert a SIM swap attack.

So, what is a SIM swap attack? A SIM swap attack is a type of fraud in which a malicious actor deceives a mobile carrier into transferring the victim’s phone number to a new SIM card controlled by the attacker. Once the phone number is transferred, the attacker can receive the victim’s calls and text messages, including sensitive authentication codes sent via SMS for two-factor authentication (2FA).

This breach enables the attacker to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to the victim’s online accounts, such as email, crypto exchange accounts, and social media profiles, leading to potential financial loss and identity theft. While mitigation efforts are never 100% effective, there are several strategies individuals can employ to combat SIM swap breaches.
The first step is essentially online vigilance by being cautious of phishing emails and other tactics used by attackers to gain access to your personal information. Further enhanced vigilance includes avoiding responses to suspicious communications such as unknown texts, emails, and phone calls. The second measure is to leverage strong and unique passwords that protect each online account. Third, the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended, and veering away from an SMS text message or email-based 2FA is also advisable. It’s wise to use stronger multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods such as standalone authentication applications, biometrics, or physical security keys.
Another protective method, and one of the most important, is to engage in security measures by contacting your telephone carrier. With specific carriers, you can request additional security measures on your account. Users can also establish a unique PIN or passcode with their carrier, which adds an extra layer of security. Some telephone line carriers offer SIM protection features that add extra security to prevent SIM swap fraud. If you don’t contact your telephone carrier, you may miss out on some of the security measures that could prevent a SIM swap attack.
Another measure is to avoid using your telephone number for social media applications like X (formerly Twitter) and other online platforms and applications. Alongside your phone number, be cautious about sharing personal information online as every piece of evidence a hacker can gather is useful to crack online accounts. For services that require a phone number for verification or communication, consider using a secondary number or a virtual phone number service like Google Voice.
By following these steps, you can avoid a SIM swap attack and protect your finances and personal information. SIM-swapping attacks have been increasing in frequency in recent years, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning in March 2023 about the rise of SIM-swapping attacks, which have resulted in millions of dollars in losses.

Bitcoin and altcoins pushing higher;"Friday has dawned brightly for the crypto sector and a push to the upside is taking place.
If stock markets fall, then this is certainly transferred to the crypto market, and being high risk assets, they are likely to fall hard. However, there are still fluctuations in markets, and they go up as well as down.
After five days of sideways action Bitcoin is rising once again.
Bitcoin found support towards the end of September at the $26,000 level and has been steadily trending upwards ever since. At time of going to press bitcoin is once more at the $27,600 resistance level, and finally taking this out and flipping it into support would be an important step in bitcoin’s climb higher.
Of course, there is still the thorny issue of the 200-week moving average just above, which previously stopped bitcoin in its tracks at $28,000. However, the trend is still up, and if bitcoin keeps knocking at this level it is likely to break through eventually.
If the Alpha beast of the crypto jungle rises then the altcoins will normally follow. Ethereum is having a strong day so far, and is currently butting up against resistance at $1,630. However, it does appear to be breaking the downwards trend from October 1, so look to $ETH to perhaps also break resistance.
Solana is having an even better day thus far. 3% up currently, $SOL is heading back to $24 at a fast rate of knots. The Solana community has its Breakpoint 2023 Conference coming up at the end of the month, and this perhaps why $SOL is moving strongly up again.
A bullish flag has been forming since the beginning of October, and $SOL looks to be breaking out. A measured move for the breakout would take the $SOL price to $29, flipping the resistance at $26 into support. 
Render ($RNDR) is another altcoin riding high. Up 1.75% on the day, $RNDR is battling resistance at $1.75. Should it overcome this, the next resistance at $1.80 awaits, with the 200-week moving average just above.
Render’s founder, Jules Urbach, is speaking at the Solana Breakpoint Conference. What he has to say is likely to be very interesting, although a ‘sell-the-news’ reaction on the $RNDR price may also be likely.

Is JPEX Facing the Same Catastrophe as FTX Exchange? Here’s What Happening;"The post Is JPEX Facing the Same Catastrophe as FTX Exchange? Here’s What Happening appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
In recent events, the JPEX virtual asset trading platform(VATPs)in Hong Kong has come under scrutiny for its suspected involvement in a major fraud case. This development has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the current regulatory framework governing cryptocurrencies. Xu Zhengyu, a prominent financial commentator, has emphasized the urgent need for more robust oversight in the industry. This article delves into the JPEX scandal and the pressing demand for a comprehensive regulatory system for cryptocurrencies.
Hui Ching-yu, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury expressed his concerns during an investment committee interview program. He underscored that the JPEX scandal highlights the pressing need for regulatory supervision in the virtual asset sector. Furthermore, he pointed out a significant regulatory gap in Hong Kong — the absence of a stablecoin framework.
Xu Zhengyu, speaking in a live online program of the Investment and Financial Education Committee, shed light on the high risks associated with unregulated virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms often lack transparency and may operate without stability or reliability. In the event of disputes or platform failures, investors have limited avenues for recourse, potentially resulting in substantial financial losses. Notable incidents, like FTX’s collapse overseas and the recent JPEX case in Hong Kong, serve as stark reminders of these risks.
Many virtual asset trading platforms have historically relied on stablecoins like USDT as trading mediums. Xu Zhengyu emphasized the necessity for these coins to maintain value stability by being backed by US dollars or gold. However, past instances have demonstrated that stablecoins can experience significant price volatility or collapse. Xu stressed that the management of reserves by stablecoin issuers directly impacts price stability and investors’ ability to redeem fiat currencies. Given these challenges, Hong Kong has refrained from permitting retail trading in stablecoins until comprehensive regulations are in place.
To safeguard investor interests and prevent conflicts of interest, Huang Lexin, Director of the Licensing Section and Head of the Financial Technology Group of the Intermediary Department of the SFC, outlined certain restrictions for licensed virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms are prohibited from offering various investment products, including periodic “pledges,” interest collection services, deposits, and derivatives transactions.
Huang Lexin also noted that SFC-licensed virtual asset trading platforms are limited to facilitating the purchase and sale of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for retail investors. Any introduction of new currencies on these platforms must adhere to stringent reporting requirements and obtain approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission before becoming available for trading.

"Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025!";"The post Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The bitcoin price trend is no less than ‘hot pancakes’ which is gaining global attention. The rise or fall in price is not restricted to demand and supply, as the institutions and whales, along with the market makers, do have a significant impact on it. After the collapse of Terra & FTX, the markets appeared to be uncertain and not in recovery mode for the next few months. However, the emergence of institutions in the crypto space lifted the momentum, which made the market participants optimistic about the future growth of the BTC price and the entire market.
It’s more clear that Bitcoin is fueling up for one of the most phenomenal runs in history. The major reason for being bullish on Bitcoin could be:
Considering these factors, industry experts believe the BTC price may witness a huge bull run over the next 18 months. After claiming a huge inflow of $150B to $200B in Bitcoin through the BlackRock ETF, the director of the firm is now confident of all the ETFs being approved in the next 3 to 6 months. This may transform the entire crypto space, with an elevated attention and adoption rate. 
With the growing confidence of investors and market participants, can the BTC price make it to $50,000 in 2024?
Analyzing the impact of the spot ETFs on the BTC price, a popular crypto proponent and influencer, tedtalksmacro, shared some context. Presently, the FDV, or fully diluted value, of Bitcoin, which is a product of maximum supply and current market price, is around $580 billion amidst the depths of the bear market and the regulatory tightening of the global central banks.
If the token forms a strong base around the current price, the next leg after the ETFs could elevate the FDV to around $780 billion, which is around $37,100 per BTC. Additionally, the central banks are estimated to ease their tight vigilance in the next 12 to 24 months, which may make the markets more optimistic, which may add up to a much higher speculative premium.
If all these go well and BTC market capitalisation moves back to $1 trillion, then the price may rise to $48,000 in late 2025 or early 2026. The analysis depends on speculations and assumptions, and many more are yet to come. However, positive sentiments continue to mount up expecting a similar price rise that happened with Gold since 2004 after the SPDR ETF.

Grayscale Pursues Groundbreaking SEC Approval for Spot Ethereum ETF;"Amid the soaring interest in digital assets, Grayscale Investment, a prominent name in the cryptocurrency space, has stepped forward with a monumental move. The company recently approached the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to transform its dominant Ethereum Trust, known as ETHE, into a Spot Ethereum ETF. This move is emblematic of the rising interest in and legitimization of cryptocurrency within traditional financial sectors
As 2023 unfolds, the buzz around exchange-traded funds (ETFs) related to digital assets has been growing louder. Giants from the traditional finance realm like BlackRock and Fidelity have already dipped their toes into the Bitcoin ETF waters. The modern digital asset industry is witnessing a paradigm shift, and Grayscale’s latest move reinforces this trend.
While Bitcoin ETFs have captured significant attention, Grayscale’s innovative approach marks a divergence. Their goal? To focus on Ethereum – another heavyweight in the crypto arena. Having submitted their application to the SEC, Grayscale aims to metamorphose their Ethereum Trust into a Spot ETH ETF. It’s worth noting that this trust isn’t a small player; it manages assets nearing the $5 billion mark.
Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale‘s visionary CEO, commented on this pivotal shift. He was quoted by Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas saying, “It’s a natural progression for the product.” Sonnenshein further elaborated, “This signifies a decisive moment to broaden Ethereum’s embrace within the regulatory framework of the US.”

Taking a trip down memory lane, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust isn’t a recent venture. Launched back in 2019, it quickly ascended to the ranks of an SEC-reporting entity in 2020. In the wake of a significant legal victory against the SEC earlier this year, the company is also hoping for a green light on their proposal to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a Spot Bitcoin ETF.
Grayscale’s move represents more than just an isolated business decision; it’s indicative of the broader trajectory of the crypto market. As financial instruments evolve, traditional institutions and regulators are being prompted to adapt and innovate. The outcome of Grayscale’s application could set a precedent for the future of Ethereum-based financial products.

Bitcoin Stopped at $28K, Toncoin Explodes 9% Daily (Market Watch);"Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down the $28,000 mark but was quickly stopped in its tracks and has returned to $27,500.
Most altcoins are trading sideways, with ADA and SOL gaining a few percentages, while ETH and BNB have retraced slightly.
Bitcoin initiated a massive leg up at the start of the week after a slow weekend that drove it from $27,000 to a multi-week peak at $28,600. As the community was anticipating the restart of the bull run, the cryptocurrency started losing value.

As reported yesterday, Toncoin, which was a massive gainer at the end of September, had lost its momentum with the start of the new month. However, the trending altcoin has gone back on the offensive in the past 24 hours. TON is up by approximately 9%, which has helped it reclaim the $2 mark.
Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and Avalanche are also slightly in the green. In fact, AVAX has jumped by about 4% and now stands firmly above $10.
In contrast, ETH, BNB, XRP, and TRX have registered minor losses. Overall, though, most larger-cap alts are relatively stable on a daily scale.
Consequently, the total crypto market cap has remained still at around $1.080 trillion on CMC.

Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down the $28,000 mark but was quickly stopped in its tracks and has returned to $27,500.
Most altcoins are trading sideways, with ADA and SOL gaining a few percentages, while ETH and BNB have retraced slightly.
Bitcoin initiated a massive leg up at the start of the week after a slow weekend that drove it from $27,000 to a multi-week peak at $28,600. As the community was anticipating the restart of the bull run, the cryptocurrency started losing value.

SBF Trial Day 3 – Former FTX CTO claims SBF granted Alameda Research ‘special privileges’ during witness testimony;"The third day of the trial against Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) unveiled deeper insights into the company’s financial operations and its founder’s personal habits.
In the morning session, testimony from Adam Yedidia, a college acquaintance of Bankman-Fried and a former Alameda and FTX staff member, provided a glimpse into the backend operations of FTX.
Yedidia delved into his work automating customer deposits and withdrawals, revealing a glitch that inflated FTX’s fiat@ftx.com account by a whopping $8 billion.
The prosecution shifted the court’s attention to the stark contrast between FTX’s original Hong Kong offices, which were extremely simple compared to the opulent offices and paddle tennis court in the Bahamas. Emphasizing signs of opulence, the prosecution also put forward images of SBF’s penthouse.
The defense countered the opulence argument by claiming that the penthouse was a shared living arrangement, while the offices were a sign of the crypto market’s success during that period. They added that SBF did not own a yacht and drove a Toyota Corolla, arguing that he led a simple life and the prosecution’s claims of opulence were unfounded.
An anecdote about SBF’s preference for sleeping on a bean bag chair in Hong Kong, which occasionally turned into naps in the Bahamas, provided a lighter moment in the proceedings.
The afternoon session was marked by Matt Huang’s testimony, co-founder of Paradigm, a significant investor in FTX. Huang’s testimony highlighted his concerns about FTX’s lack of a traditional governance structure and potential favorable conditions for Alameda Research.
Gary Wang, FTX’s Chief Technology Officer, admitted to financial misconduct during his tenure at FTX during his testimony. He further discussed specific privileges allegedly granted to Alameda Research on SBF’s instruction.
Judge Lewis Kaplan didn’t shy away from intervening, reproaching the defense on several occasions for repetitive lines of questioning, especially during Yedidia’s cross-examination.
Off the stand, the day was peppered with mentions of a book, “Number Go Up” by Zeke Faux, which narrates SBF’s descent in the crypto industry.
The trial, drawing national attention, is set to continue with Wang’s testimony and indications from the prosecution that subsequent witnesses will include industry heavyweights like BlockFi CEO Zac Prince and Elan Dekel from Pinecone.
Federal prosecutors have targeted two private jets, a Bombardier Global 5000 and an Embraer Legacy, linked to cryptocurrency executive Sam Bankman-Fried.
The aircraft, worth a combined $70 million, might be confiscated due to its connection to alleged illicit activities by Bankman-Fried. The crypto executive, who is currently on trial, has denied all charges against him.
US-based employees of FTX reportedly discovered a secret backdoor in the exchange’s system that allowed Alameda Research to access customer funds.
This revelation has raised concerns and skepticism, especially with Alameda’s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, and other executives acknowledging the use of these funds.
Creditors of the now-bankrupt FTX are optimistic as Google considers a $2B investment in AI firm Anthropic. Previously, FTX and Alameda Research had invested a combined $500M in Anthropic.
If this new investment comes to fruition, it could significantly raise the value of FTX’s stake, aiding in compensating the exchange’s defunct users.
The individual responsible for exploiting FTX has converted another $25M of stolen Ethereum to Bitcoin. The conversion was executed via THORChain Router, with the exploiter now having converted a total of $100M since the hack in January 2023.
These moves have coincided with the commencement of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial, sparking speculation that an insider may have been involved in the hack.

On-Chain Data Shows Increased Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) Accumulation Among Whales;"The post On-Chain Data Shows Increased Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) Accumulation Among Whales appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) has seen more large transactions than ever since March.
Santiment noted in a tweet that WBTC whale transfers above $1 million are spiking to their highest rate since March. WBTC also saw its most significant network growth since July and a jump in new wallets holding 1-1,000 WBTC.
 #WrappedBitcoin is seeing its highest rate of $1M+ whale transactions since March, highest network growth since July, and a notable spike in 1-1K $WBTC wallets created. Similar increases were seen just prior to both the March and June #crypto rallies. https://t.co/wjiwLWNXki pic.twitter.com/dU4nTQ1oN4
The firm said similar on-chain shifts preceded rallies in March and June this year. The data suggests heightened whale accumulation and interest in the Bitcoin proxy ahead of the potential crypto market upside.
Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) has experienced notable transaction activity on several occasions. On July 1, 2023, the transaction volume of WBTC surged to over 7,000, marking the second significant spike in just over two months. On August 2, 2023, two substantial transfers of 2,000 WBTC each impacted the overall supply of WBTC on exchanges.
WBTC plays a crucial role in enabling the use of Bitcoin in smart contracts and enhancing the accessibility of the world’s largest cryptocurrency on decentralized exchanges (DEX).
Meanwhile, analyst Charles Edwards highlighted in another tweet that Bitcoin’s long-term holder supply is expanding comparably to 2016 levels.
Edwards believes this increase in holders will have major consequences in 2024, more akin to the 2017 bull run’s 10x price gains versus 2020’s run. This strengthening holder base reflects a step-change in accumulation.
The on-chain insights indicate heightened conviction in Bitcoin among both whale traders and long-term investors.
Key metrics like exchange reserves, active addresses, and transaction volumes further affirm accumulation is occurring at pivotal support around $20,000. The blockchain data shows holders are positioning for the next bull run.

BCH Price Analysis: Will This Pattern Push BCH TO $300?;"The post BCH Price Analysis: Will This Pattern Push BCH TO $300? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
As the overall market recovers, with Bitcoin taking a bullish step in October, the altcoins are on a positive track. Even though the BCH price breached the $250 mark in the first two days of October with a remarkable growth of 10%. 
Despite this, the overhead supply pressure at the psychological level caused a sharp correction in the Bitcoin Cash market price. However, with the sentiment turning bullish, expectations for the Bitcoin Cash price prediction in 2023 remain optimistic.
Although there has been a recent correction, the overall trend of the BCH price suggests a bullish revival and a rise to higher levels. The bullish reversal from the buyers’ region at $180 and the 200-day EMA provided the Bitcoin Cash price with a springboard to regain momentum.
Moreover, the recent sharp correction to the $230 mark increases the chances of an inverted head and shoulder. Currently, the altcoin price trades at $231.50, with multiple Doji candle formations at the $230 support level.
With the underlying bullish sentiments averting downfall, the chances of BCH price taking a reversal to $250 are increasing. This recovery phase will complete the bullish pattern with the neckline at $250.
Technical indicators:
Coming to the technical indicators, the Directional Movement Index sustains a bullish point of view. 
DMI indicator: The ADX line (black line) has shot up in recent times, indicating a strong momentum. Additionally, the DI line remains bullish, signaling further recovery.
EMA: The 50 and 200-day EMA maintain a positive alignment and continue to rise higher, which certifies the uptrend in motion. 
With plans for a bullish reversal from $230, the inverted head and shoulder pattern presents a trend reversal opportunity in BCH price. However, if the price struggles to overcome the $250 mark, it may lead to a potential pullback to $228. 
However, the inverted head and shoulder breakout will increase the likelihood of Bitcoin Cash price exceeding $300. With the potential to continue the rally above, the reversal from $250 or the $250 breakout will prove a crucial entry point for sideline buyers. 
Considering the price breaks below the $228 post, the downtrend will plunge the prices to $200.

Shielding Your Digital Realm: How to Protect Yourself and Crypto From SIM Swap Attacks;"In 2023, several SIM swap attacks have targeted cryptocurrency advocates and high-profile industry members, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Below is a comprehensive guide aimed at educating our readers on mitigating SIM swap attacks and safeguarding against hacks.
Recently, Bitcoin.com News reported that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin fell victim to a SIM swap attack. Moreover, this week, an Ethereum (ETH) investor suffered a SIM swap attack, losing 22 ETH on the friend.tech blockchain social media platform, which operates on the Base network. Unfortunately, a significant number of SIM swap attacks are targeting crypto investors. The subsequent walkthrough will guide our readers on how to avert a SIM swap attack.

So, what is a SIM swap attack? A SIM swap attack is a type of fraud in which a malicious actor deceives a mobile carrier into transferring the victim’s phone number to a new SIM card controlled by the attacker. Once the phone number is transferred, the attacker can receive the victim’s calls and text messages, including sensitive authentication codes sent via SMS for two-factor authentication (2FA).

This breach enables the attacker to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to the victim’s online accounts, such as email, crypto exchange accounts, and social media profiles, leading to potential financial loss and identity theft. While mitigation efforts are never 100% effective, there are several strategies individuals can employ to combat SIM swap breaches.
The first step is essentially online vigilance by being cautious of phishing emails and other tactics used by attackers to gain access to your personal information. Further enhanced vigilance includes avoiding responses to suspicious communications such as unknown texts, emails, and phone calls. The second measure is to leverage strong and unique passwords that protect each online account. Third, the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended, and veering away from an SMS text message or email-based 2FA is also advisable. It’s wise to use stronger multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods such as standalone authentication applications, biometrics, or physical security keys.
Another protective method, and one of the most important, is to engage in security measures by contacting your telephone carrier. With specific carriers, you can request additional security measures on your account. Users can also establish a unique PIN or passcode with their carrier, which adds an extra layer of security. Some telephone line carriers offer SIM protection features that add extra security to prevent SIM swap fraud. If you don’t contact your telephone carrier, you may miss out on some of the security measures that could prevent a SIM swap attack.
Another measure is to avoid using your telephone number for social media applications like X (formerly Twitter) and other online platforms and applications. Alongside your phone number, be cautious about sharing personal information online as every piece of evidence a hacker can gather is useful to crack online accounts. For services that require a phone number for verification or communication, consider using a secondary number or a virtual phone number service like Google Voice.
By following these steps, you can avoid a SIM swap attack and protect your finances and personal information. SIM-swapping attacks have been increasing in frequency in recent years, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning in March 2023 about the rise of SIM-swapping attacks, which have resulted in millions of dollars in losses.
Have you taken steps to protect yourself from SIM swap attacks? Let us know your strategies in the comments section below.

Kraken Expanding In Europe Despite MiCA, To Acquire Dutch Broker;"Kraken, one of the world’s oldest crypto exchanges, is strengthening its presence in Europe and plans to buy Coin Meester B.V. (BCM), a Dutch crypto broker. In a press release on October 5, Kraken said the purchase would give them a “sizable position in the Dutch market” and benefit the broker’s clients.
BCM supports over 170 digital assets and is one of the oldest brokers in the country. By acquiring BCM, Kraken is asserting its commitment to expand across Europe. The exchange plans to expand its product line, increase liquidity, and improve security for a broader user base.
Kraken CEO David Ripley said:
The Netherlands has one of the world’s most advanced economies, with a well-established culture of innovation and a high level of crypto adoption. This makes it a key market for us in our European expansion plans. The acquisition of BCM will give Kraken a sizable position in the Dutch market. It will allow BCM’s clients to benefit from an even more robust product offering.
Kraken said they are buoyed by the European Commission’s introduction of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. MiCA seeks to bring comprehensive crypto regulation to the European Union (EU). 
These rules aim to standardize the regulatory environment for various crypto assets, including fungible assets like Ethereum (ETH) or Bitcoin (BTC) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
Nonetheless, the European Union has claimed that MiCA’s primary objective is to protect consumers and investors by mitigating risks associated with crypto, including hacks and rug pulls while promoting financial stability and market integrity. 
By establishing clear rules and requirements for crypto businesses and market participants, MiCA aims to “level the playing field,” even fostering innovation. MiCA took effect on June 1, 2023. Its full implementation will be in 2024. 
As a result of these developments, crypto firms and exchanges, such as Binance France, are closely watching MiCA’s implementation. In late August, Binance France said the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) license presented “an opportunity to adapt to regulatory challenges and capitalize on opportunities within the European market.”
In Europe, Kraken has already obtained an Electronic Money Institution license from the Central Bank of Ireland and a virtual asset service provider (VASP) registration from the Bank of Spain. With the Irish license, Kraken can offer euro-to-crypto trading services in the EU.

Bitcoin and altcoins pushing higher;"Friday has dawned brightly for the crypto sector and a push to the upside is taking place.
If stock markets fall, then this is certainly transferred to the crypto market, and being high risk assets, they are likely to fall hard. However, there are still fluctuations in markets, and they go up as well as down.
After five days of sideways action Bitcoin is rising once again.
Bitcoin found support towards the end of September at the $26,000 level and has been steadily trending upwards ever since. At time of going to press bitcoin is once more at the $27,600 resistance level, and finally taking this out and flipping it into support would be an important step in bitcoin’s climb higher.
Of course, there is still the thorny issue of the 200-week moving average just above, which previously stopped bitcoin in its tracks at $28,000. However, the trend is still up, and if bitcoin keeps knocking at this level it is likely to break through eventually.
If the Alpha beast of the crypto jungle rises then the altcoins will normally follow. Ethereum is having a strong day so far, and is currently butting up against resistance at $1,630. However, it does appear to be breaking the downwards trend from October 1, so look to $ETH to perhaps also break resistance.
Solana is having an even better day thus far. 3% up currently, $SOL is heading back to $24 at a fast rate of knots. The Solana community has its Breakpoint 2023 Conference coming up at the end of the month, and this perhaps why $SOL is moving strongly up again.
A bullish flag has been forming since the beginning of October, and $SOL looks to be breaking out. A measured move for the breakout would take the $SOL price to $29, flipping the resistance at $26 into support. 
Render ($RNDR) is another altcoin riding high. Up 1.75% on the day, $RNDR is battling resistance at $1.75. Should it overcome this, the next resistance at $1.80 awaits, with the 200-week moving average just above.
Render’s founder, Jules Urbach, is speaking at the Solana Breakpoint Conference. What he has to say is likely to be very interesting, although a ‘sell-the-news’ reaction on the $RNDR price may also be likely.

"Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025!";"The post Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Draw $200B Inflow-BlackRock Exec; Here’s Where BTC Price May Reach in 2025! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The bitcoin price trend is no less than ‘hot pancakes’ which is gaining global attention. The rise or fall in price is not restricted to demand and supply, as the institutions and whales, along with the market makers, do have a significant impact on it. After the collapse of Terra & FTX, the markets appeared to be uncertain and not in recovery mode for the next few months. However, the emergence of institutions in the crypto space lifted the momentum, which made the market participants optimistic about the future growth of the BTC price and the entire market.
It’s more clear that Bitcoin is fueling up for one of the most phenomenal runs in history. The major reason for being bullish on Bitcoin could be:
Considering these factors, industry experts believe the BTC price may witness a huge bull run over the next 18 months. After claiming a huge inflow of $150B to $200B in Bitcoin through the BlackRock ETF, the director of the firm is now confident of all the ETFs being approved in the next 3 to 6 months. This may transform the entire crypto space, with an elevated attention and adoption rate. 
With the growing confidence of investors and market participants, can the BTC price make it to $50,000 in 2024?
Analyzing the impact of the spot ETFs on the BTC price, a popular crypto proponent and influencer, tedtalksmacro, shared some context. Presently, the FDV, or fully diluted value, of Bitcoin, which is a product of maximum supply and current market price, is around $580 billion amidst the depths of the bear market and the regulatory tightening of the global central banks.
If the token forms a strong base around the current price, the next leg after the ETFs could elevate the FDV to around $780 billion, which is around $37,100 per BTC. Additionally, the central banks are estimated to ease their tight vigilance in the next 12 to 24 months, which may make the markets more optimistic, which may add up to a much higher speculative premium.
If all these go well and BTC market capitalisation moves back to $1 trillion, then the price may rise to $48,000 in late 2025 or early 2026. The analysis depends on speculations and assumptions, and many more are yet to come. However, positive sentiments continue to mount up expecting a similar price rise that happened with Gold since 2004 after the SPDR ETF.
