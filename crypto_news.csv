Analyst Says One Altcoin Looking Ugly, Updates Outlook on Solana and One Additional Crypto Asset;"A closely followed crypto strategist says that one altcoin with a market cap of $1.934 billion looks anything but bullish.
Pseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 196,800 followers on the social media platform X that the native asset of the interoperable blockchain ecosystem Cosmos (ATOM) appears poised for more downside price action.
ATOM, which is down about 60% from its 2023 high of $15.45, will likely drop all the way down to $5.50 before witnessing a relief rally, according to the analyst.
“ATOM: I know the Dapp (decentralized applications) chain future is big but man, this is one ugly chart. I don’t see any relief until the mid-$5s truthfully… That should be a decent bounce area. Still no reason to buy this one though, in my opinion.”
At time of writing, ATOM is trading for $6.61.
Altcoin Sherpa is also watching the price action of Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL). The analyst says that for now, SOL is trapped in a wide trading range between $16 and $27.
“SOL: haven’t checked this chart in a bit. I don’t see any real change in the higher time frame charts. I think that it’s still just a range between $16-$27 and some deviations on both ends. Best to probably just buy and hold this for a bit.”
At time of writing, SOL is worth $22.10.
Another altcoin on the trader’s radar is the native asset of the decentralized pool trading platform Woo Network (WOO). Altcoin Sherpa shares a chart suggesting that WOO remains in a sideways trend with support at around $0.147.
“WOO: great project/exchange overall, had some good news recently with them burning the 3AC (Three Arrows Capital) tokens and that supply being gone. I still don’t really see this as a buy at this current time but probably a decent longer-term investment.
(I am holding a long-term bag of this).” 
At time of writing, WOO is trading at $0.178.

Cardano Price Prediction 2023, 2024, 2025: What Are The Chances of Cardano Reaching $1 in 2023?;"The post Cardano Price Prediction 2023, 2024, 2025: What Are The Chances of Cardano Reaching $1 in 2023? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Despite multiple roadblocks, the crypto market turns on recovery mode, and Cardano prepares a sprint to recover the lost levels of the previous bull run. With a bullish start to this October, the ADA price teases a pattern breakout to initiate a high-speed rally.
Despite trading significantly lower by 92.05% from its all-time high of $3.10, the Cardano remains a top choice for investors, with market price predictions teasing a jump this altseason. 
Despite ADA’s price performance showing a few peaks, the sharp fall from its all-time high keeps investors pondering: “Is Cardano Dead?”
Are you considering to buy Cardano this month? Dive into our Cardano price prediction for 2023-2030 and find the best opportunity to buy Cardano. 
And for burning questions like “Is Cardano a good investment?” or “Will Cardano reach $100?” – we’ve got you covered in our detailed Cardano (ADA) price forecast for 2023-2030. 
Cardano had a strong start to the year with an 83% jump, but its price has since fallen back due to the overall market correction. However, Cardano is still outperforming many other cryptocurrencies on a year-to-date basis. Some analysts believe Cardano is now undervalued and poised for a bullish resurgence, starting from the $0.24 level.
The ADA price is currently in a symmetrical triangle pattern, with the resistance trendline remaining strong, so the buyers support the price at $0.24. The recent higher-level price rejection suggests that the ADA trend is struggling to regain momentum and break through the resistance trendline.
However, with the overall cryptocurrency market showing signs of recovery, Cardano’s price could soon bounce back.
With the ADA price trapped between the resistance and support trendlines. If the buyers can manage to push the price above the resistance trendline, it could lead to a bullish rally. However, if the sellers manage to push the price below the support trendline, it could lead to a bearish correction. 
If ADA breaks above the resistance trendline, the breakout rally could take it to $0.30, followed by a further rise to $0.356. On the downside, a fall below the $0.25 zone could test the $0.24 support level.
The market is buzzing with optimism as Cardano’s price shows signs of a bullish reversal. The double bottom pattern at $0.24 serves as a strong foundation for the uptrend, which is further confirmed by a falling wedge breakout on the daily chart.
With the Bitcoin ETF approval coming next month, which is expected to improve the overall market sentiment, the Cardano coin price could recover significantly. Moreover, it can reclaim many of its previously broken levels. 
The Cardano coin price daily chart displays bearish tension as the year-to-date growth of just 6.50%. Nevertheless, it provided multiple trading opportunities and even created a swing high of 85% in April 2023. 
With the recent breakout rally and the double bottom reversal being the key entry levels, the recovery rally will prove pivotal. 
Currently trading at $0.262, the Cardano coin price brings a buying opportunity at the dip as it reverses from the $0.235 mark. By the end of 2023, the ADA price is expected to reach the $0.669 mark. However, a consolidation breakdown will retest the $0.20 mark.

In the year of 4th Bitcoin halving and a potential altcoin season, the value of Cardano (ADA) is sure to skyrocket. Moreover, the potential rise of centralized finance institutions entering DeFi will fuel the increased demand for ADA. 
Therefore, with a bull run in 2024, Cardano prices are expected to create a new swing high of $1.63. With an average of $1.695, the ADA prices could settle down at $1.37 by the end of 2024 due to exhaustion.
The year 2025 could signal growth for ADA, with prices potentially oscillating between a low of $1.81 and a high of $2.42. The average price during this period could stand at $2.115.

Moving into 2026, ADA’s potential price is foreseen to elevate further, ranging between a low of $2.76 and a high of $3.30. The average price during this period could stand at $3.03.  
By 2027, the analysis suggests a further surge in ADA’s value, with the price potentially hitting between $4.56 and $5.03. The average price during this period could stand at $4.79.  
In 2028, ADA’s price could potentially rise to fall between $5.29 and $5.73. The average price during this period could stand at $5.51.  
By 2029, ADA’s price is projected to ascend between $6.68 and $7.79. The average price during this period could stand at $7.235.  
Finally, by 2030, ADA’s price is predicted to soar between $9.12 and $10.32. The average price during this period could stand at $9.72.  
*The aforementioned targets are the average targets set by the respective firms.
Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the upcoming updates of the network, we can expect a wider adoption rate of Cardano. Moreover, with the upcoming bull run propelled fueled by the Bitcoin halving 2024 followed by a new altcoin season, Cardano is all set to create unprecedented new heights. 
All of these bullish signals can help Cardano reach $2.42 by the end of 2025. On the flip side, if another selling spree starts in 2025, the year-end price will be close to $1.81. 
Cardano is an underrated investment and has a high chance of performing in the next couple of years, considering the plethora of applications.
The price of ADA could surge to a maximum of $0.669 by the end of 2023.
If you are holding your ADA tokens for the long term, there is no downside to staking all of it.
According to our Cardano price prediction, the altcoin’s price could hit a maximum of $2.42 by the end of 2025.  
Cardano is not dead, as it is witnessing major developmental upgrades, which could boost ADA’s price in the near future. 
Even the most bullish of Cardano supporters acknowledge that Cardano will only potentially surpass Ethereum within 8 to 10 years
Assuming the best case is that you invested in Cardano in January 2020, your investment would have increased by 550%. In short, for every $100 you would have made an extra $550.

This Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rival Affected by BitMEX’s Recent Delisting Spree;"TL;DR


The leading cryptocurrency exchange – BitMEX – announced the delisting of ten perpetual swap contracts on its platform. Namely, the trading pairs include FLOKI/USD, FLOKI/USDT, 1TAIDOGE/USD, 1TAIDOGE/USDT, BOB/USD, GMX/USD, GMX/USDT, ORDI/USD, RNDR/USD, and TURBO/USD.
The company said removing the aforementioned options follows “insufficient trading interest in these contracts.” 
“Once a contract has expired, the lifetime profit and loss of that contract will be added to the user’s Bitcoin balance for XBT margined contracts or Tether balance for USDT margined contracts, and this contract will no longer appear on the Positions section,” BitMEX clarified.
Despite being included in the delisting effort, the price of Floki Inu (FLOKI) did not suffer. In fact, the memecoin has gone up approximately 3% for the past 24 hours (per CoinGecko), defying the overall bearish trend in the cryptocurrency market since the BTC ETF rumors turned out to be false. 
The asset has been among the best-performing memecoins lately. While the largest ones by market capitalization – Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) – have recorded minor gains in the past 30 days, FLOKI has surged over 15%.
Floki Inu is only one of the hundreds of memecoins that exist nowadays. Those assets have been quite intriguing for investors due to their enhanced volatility and potential for rapid price increases. However, individuals should keep in mind that some of them have little-to-no use cases and could present serious risks.
Readers willing to find out more about the biggest memecoins, their purposes, and specifics could take a look at our dedicated video below:

Bitcoin Price Prediction to $220K by Max Keiser but There’s a Catch;"TL;DR

Max Keiser, Chairman of El Salvador-based Bitcoin mining startup Volcano Energy, recently shared his thoughts on his previous $220k price target for BTC, stating that “social unrest” and “societal breakdown” are necessary to boost its price to such levels.
“Keep in mind, Bitcoin trades at these levels after social unrest and societal breakdown are irreversibly causing havoc.”
Amid the havoc caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, investors and retailers started looking for assets that could work as hedges against rising fiduciary inflation.
This year saw almost all major economies shutting down and the Federal Reserve putting its printing machines on turbo mode so the government could send stimulus checks to households as financial aid amid rising unemployment.
During those times, the BTC halving was set to take place in May, further capturing the interest of investors who further speculated on future prices. The next Bitcoin halving will take place on April 24, 2024. Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao advised the crypto community to remain patient and lower expectations, as the price of BTC “won’t hit all-time highs overnight.”
Keiser, famously known for The Keiser Report, has been a Bitcoin advocate for several years. He’s the founder of Volcano Energy, a BTC mining startup that seeks to create a 241 MW renewable power generation park in the Mapatán region of El Salvador.
The same day, Keiser stated that the new law against naked short selling imposed by US financial regulators means that “the big guys like BlackRock won’t have their primary means of manipulating prices down.”
Just in time for #Bitcoin’s next leg up. Getting rid of naked short selling means big guys like BlackRock etc. won’t have their primary means of manipulating prices down.
This will also benefit Gold & Silver but #Bitcoin will 20 to 50x them. https://t.co/p0kCqAAWJa
— Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) October 17, 2023

Naked short selling involves two parties: the broker and the seller. In short, the seller doesn’t own the shares they’re trying to sell because the broker has not settled the shares in the investor’s account first. This allows traders to sell unlimited non-existent shares, manipulating a company’s price.
Others predict prices north of $100k by 2025. In alignment with what CZ said about BTC hitting new ATH the year after the halving, technical analyst CryptoCon set the price target at $138k.
The analyst experimented with Bitcoin’s cycle tops using different models for trend and price patterns to forecast possible outcomes, and the results were prices north of $128k, $135k, and the highest being $140k.
I’ve been doing a lot of #Bitcoin cycle top experiments lately, and I keep seeing right around the same price… 130k.
Here again, we see a price of 138k.

Coinbase Announces 80 Trading Pairs To Be Delisted;"One of the top crypto exchanges in the world, Coinbase, has announced that it is delisting 80 trading pairs from its platform. Indeed, they have notified users of suspended trading for non-USD markets across their various platforms, including Coinbase Exchange and Coinbase Prime. 
The platform stated that the decision was the result of regularly monitoring the markets. Moreover, they assured that the decision was made “in an effort to improve overall market health and consolidate liquidity” in a subsequent post to X (formerly Twitter).

Specifically, Coinbase has announced that they are delisting 80 trading pairs on their platform. Moreover, they explained the decision in a post to X. There, they laid out the affected pairs while also discussing the reasoning behind the decision.

Coinbase stated that they “regularly monitor the market on our exchange.” Additionally, they noted it is done “in an effort to improve overall market health and consolidate liquidity,” which has informed the decision to delist the plethora of trading Paris. 
Alternatively, Bloomberg previously reported a sharp decline in Coinbase spot trading volume. Specifically, they stated the figure fell by more than half during quarter three. The platform recorded $76 billion in spot trading volume, which is down an official 52% from last year. Still, the platform has gained market share as competitor Binance has faced increased regulatory scrutiny.

Honda refutes claims of adopting crypto as a payment option;"In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency adoption, the auto industry has become a focus of interest. Recent reports suggested that Honda, a major automobile manufacturer, was now accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment for their vehicles. However, the truth appears to be more nuanced. Honda itself does not directly accept cryptocurrency payments, but there is a workaround through a third party, FCF Pay.
In early October, several publications erroneously reported that Honda had begun accepting cryptocurrencies as a means of payment for their cars. However, American Honda swiftly debunked these claims, stating that they do not accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment. This clarification came directly from an American Honda spokesperson who stated that the recent reports regarding a change to this policy are not correct. While Honda’s official stance on cryptocurrency payments remains unchanged, there are alternative options for those eager to purchase a Honda vehicle using cryptocurrencies.
FCF Pay is the intermediary that facilitates the use of cryptocurrencies to buy cars, including those from Honda. According to Joseph Parkin, the Chief Operating Officer of FCF Pay, Honda isn’t the only car brand available on this platform. There is a list of other car manufacturers, including names like Mercedes, BMW, Ford, Nissan, and Mitsubishi, that can be purchased using cryptocurrencies through FCF Pay. The core of this system relies on a payment aggregator that operates on the same payment rails used for cash payments in bank branches.
In essence, cryptocurrencies act as a form of digital cash or the cash of the internet within this ecosystem. However, it’s essential to note that only those companies integrated into FCF Pay’s bill payment aggregation system are currently available for cryptocurrency purchases. While FCF Pay currently operates within the United States, there are expansion plans. FCF Pay is actively working with partners to facilitate crypto-to-fiat bill settlements in Mexico, various Latin American countries, multiple African nations, and across Asia.
This expansion aims to bring the convenience of cryptocurrency payments to a more global audience. The bill payments system by FCF Pay went live in September 2023, enabling customers to purchase products using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, USDT, USDC, and others, with a fee of $3 plus a 2% charge. Joseph Parkin, the COO of FCF Pay, expressed the company’s mission to onboard companies and corporations of every size and in every sector for direct crypto payments, and hope that governments around the world open their eyes soon to the benefits of making it easier for companies to accept crypto payments.
FCF Pay has not entered into partnerships with automobile manufacturers like Honda to enable cryptocurrency payments for their cars. Instead, their system allows customers to make payments with cryptocurrencies, but the companies listed on their bill payments system receive fiat currency via their payment aggregator partner. This setup allows for flexibility in payments and opens up possibilities for consumers interested in using their cryptocurrencies for everyday purchases, such as buying a car. The world of cryptocurrencies is not without its challenges and controversies, and FCF Pay has had its share.
Notably, FCF Pay’s X (formerly Twitter) account was suspended on October 5, and this suspension has been attributed to accusations based on fake news circulating about the company. Joseph Parkin noted that the company was accused of claiming partnerships with the companies on our bill payments system, whereas we were trying our absolute best to dispel these misrepresentations from other news sources. The situation was exacerbated by what FCF Pay describes as “bot-like interactions” on their X account in the days leading up to the suspension.
There are suspicions that this activity may have been an attempt by competitors or other supporting communities to get the account suspended. In response to this challenge, FCF Pay is considering a rebranding effort. Parkin stated that the good news is that they are in the process of rebranding anyway as they lead up to their mobile app release at the end of the year. The firm will simply accelerate the process of switching over to the new branding if the FCF Pay account doesn’t get unblocked soon. This approach exemplifies the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into everyday transactions, offering an alternative payment method for consumers in the ever-evolving financial landscape.

Predicting the Future: The Evolving Landscape of Cryptocurrency Trading;"As one chapter closes on cryptocurrency trading in the UK, it ushers in a dawn of structured, regulated, and consumer-protective crypto operations. The recent actions by the FCA and the consequential shifts in the market landscape signify a transformative moment, not just a fleeting change.
While any transformation can usher in uncertainty, it's also a powerful catalyst for evolution. In its formative years, the UK's crypto market was reminiscent of the Wild West — rapid growth, fervent enthusiasm, and palpable risk. But as the dust settles, the emerging landscape reveals a future likely dominated by entities valuing user safety, regulatory compliance, and transparent services.
Given the UK's significant appetite for digital assets, the evolving trajectory indicates that users will gravitate towards platforms offering both diverse trading options and an inherent sense of security and reliability. The FCA's rigorous measures, though perceived by some as restrictive, essentially set a new standard for crypto operations. Those platforms that rise to meet these elevated standards — and possibly even surpass them — are poised to thrive in this changed ecosystem.
In this reshaped market, it's less about mere survival and more about leadership. As crypto in the UK navigates its new normal, platforms that blend adaptability, user-centricity, and a commitment to safe trading will likely be at the forefront. It's a world beyond mere transactions; it's about fostering trust in a digital age.
Let's take a closer look at the current UK landscape, exchanges facing regulatory hurdles, platforms limiting access to both existing and new users, and discern where traders might find solace in this uncertain era.
The UK crypto market has undergone a seismic shift in recent weeks, with changes so profound they are reminiscent of the wild early days of the cryptocurrency scene. New FCA regulations, coupled with the exit of crypto giants like Binance and ByBit, have left traders in a lurch, looking for platforms that align with the new crypto landscape and where they feel valued and safe. 
The crypto world has always thrived on innovation and rapid growth. But with rapid growth comes the need for oversight. The FCA’s October 8 announcement was a game-changer, introducing several measures to protect investors:

● Cooling-Off Periods: A tool to prevent impulsive investments, especially pertinent given the volatility of the crypto market.
● Banning 'Refer a Friend' Bonuses: A direct move to ensure user acquisition is genuine and not merely incentive-driven.
● Setting Right Expectations: Mandatory risk warnings will go a long way in ensuring informed investments, mitigating potential user regrets.

The need for these regulations is further underscored by the FCA's own data: a noticeable surge in crypto ownership from 2021 to 2022. With a growing user base, establishing guidelines becomes pivotal.
In a bid to regulate the burgeoning crypto advertising landscape, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) extended an olive branch to crypto enterprises, allowing them to collaborate with third-party providers for vetting their advertisements. One such prominent partnership emerged between Binance and Rebuildingsociety.com. However, this alliance was short-lived. Mere days into their collaboration, ads associated with Rebuildingsociety.com were abruptly suspended. Compounding the situation, the FCA rescinded the firm's license, casting a shadow over such third-party vetting processes. This series of events set the stage for more significant changes, particularly for Binance's operations in the UK.
Binance's sudden exit can be termed as nothing short of a shockwave. A titan in the crypto world, its decision to cease new registrations in the UK not only showcased the force of the new regulations but also highlighted potential vulnerabilities in the strategies of even the largest exchanges.
While Binance's exit was swift, it was not entirely unforeseen. Their tussles with the FCA date back to 2021. With the latest FCA mandates, especially around marketing, Binance's alliance with Rebuildingsociety.com came under the scanner, further complicating their UK operations.
Additionally, Binance's global challenges, especially with US regulators, have somewhat dampened their indomitable image. A marked decline in their market share underscores this. The FCA's stringent requirements, combined with global pressures, have pushed Binance into a challenging corner, at least in the UK market.
Another big player, ByBit, departed too from the UK market, just weeks before the Binance news, further underscoring the challenges crypto exchanges are facing in adapting to the new regulatory environment. Their comprehensive exit strategy emphasizes the gravity of the situation.
ByBit's outlined restrictions, from trading to settlements, indicate a significant operational overhaul. The diverse impacts on their product suite highlight a need for exchanges to revisit and realign their offerings in light of regulatory shifts. 
Amidst the turbulence and trepidation stirred by these significant departures, cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traders are left grappling with uncertainty. In a digital realm where trust is paramount, they now find themselves in a quandary: Where should they steer their investments? Which platforms can be entrusted with their precious assets in this rapidly evolving regulatory climate? As the crypto landscape adjusts to these seismic shifts, new champions of trust and resilience begin to emerge, offering a beacon of hope and stability for concerned users.
Rising from the tumultuous bear market of 2018, Bitget has exhibited remarkable tenacity and an upward growth arc. This derivatives exchange has not only displayed adaptability but also entrenched its stance on user protection and clarity.
The platform has catapulted itself as a dominant figure in the crypto realm, marking its territory as the fourth-leading CEX by crypto trade volume. Even when the crypto sector reeled from FTX's downfall, Bitget showcased fortitude. Nansen, a reputed research entity, spotlighted Bitget as the only exchange to witness a futures trading volume surge. Impressively, while other exchanges grappled with setbacks, Bitget's spot trading rocketed to US$60 billion in Q2 2023, registering a 3% growth Quarter-on-Quarter. Though their futures trading witnessed an 8% slump, it displayed remarkable tenacity amid the widespread market slump.
Bitget's stellar journey is further amplified by the meteoric rise of its native token, Bitget Token (BGB), which soared to a peak of US$0.513378, solidifying its position as 2023's top-performing CEX token.
The platform doesn't rest on its laurels. Innovations like one-click copy trading, spot trading, and AI-powered bot trading differentiate it. With a dedicated compliance squad, Bitget maintains ongoing discourse with international regulators. Their commitment to clarity shines through their quarterly updates on GitHub and an impressive proof of reserves at 208%. Possessing a safety net valued at $350 million — twice their client assets — Bitget prioritizes security, pledging to uphold this fund for a minimum of three years.

● Growth in Adversity: Amidst market volatilities, Bitget's blossoming futures trading volume and the ascendancy of the Bitget Token (BGB) validate its strong operational efficiency and the trust it commands from users.
● User Protection Front and Center: A jaw-dropping $350 million safety fund accentuates Bitget's unwavering commitment to safeguarding its users.
● Transparency Champion: With regular clarity updates on GitHub, Bitget's promise of openness resonates, bolstering its stature as a reliable exchange.

Incepted in 2017, OKX made rapid strides in the world of cryptocurrency, marking its presence in over 100 nations today. Not just limited to traditional trading, OKX diversifies its spectrum by offering platforms from Web3 Yield to an NFT Marketplace, meeting the varying needs of crypto aficionados. The platform takes pride in its efficient and wallet-friendly trading environment, showcasing more than 85 digital currencies available for GBP acquisition, and potential fee incentives using the OKB token.
Beyond the popular names like Bitcoin and Ethereum, OKX's catalog ventures into the lesser-traveled cryptos, ensuring its clientele enjoys a diverse investment range. Furthermore, its competitive fee tiers cater to traders of varying scales.
While it has earned worldwide acknowledgment, OKX hasn’t been without challenges, including the 2020 fund lockdown episode. Yet, with its vast array of options, regulatory prudence, and steadfast security protocols, it remains a formidable force in the crypto sphere.

● On-the-Move Trading: Their intuitive mobile application facilitates seamless trading for both iOS and Android aficionados.
● Global Regulatory Alertness: Recent achievements like the VARA license in Dubai underline OKX's proactive regulatory approach.
● Security Excellence: With features like two-factor authentication and transparent proof of reserves, buttressed by a $700 million risk reserve fund, OKX's dedication to safeguarding its users is evident.

KuCoin: The Pinnacle of Advanced Crypto Trade
For those acquainted with the intricate world of crypto trading, KuCoin emerges as a captivating oasis. Renowned for its minimalistic fees and an impressive lineup of over 600 cryptocurrencies, including the renowned Bitcoin and Ethereum, it's no surprise that KuCoin is a magnet for a significant portion of the global crypto populace.
With a claim to 1 out of every 4 global crypto users, the platform promises fluidity and a vibrant user environment. Although a 2020 hiccup with hot wallets drew attention, KuCoin's rapid, insured action reinforced its pledge to reliability and openness.
KuCoin, while a treasure trove for the well-versed, may appear intricate to novices. Its extensive crypto collection, attractive fees, and superior trading instruments make it a favorite, but as with any crypto journey, vigilant exploration is advised.

● Crypto Repository: Boasting a mammoth collection of over 600 cryptocurrencies, KuCoin provides traders with an expansive arena, housing both well-known giants and hidden gems.
● Cost-Efficient Transactions: KuCoin’s fee blueprint is every trader’s dream, offering negligible trading charges, no monthly account fees, and competitive withdrawal rates.
● Yield Possibilities: 'KuCoin Earn' revitalizes dormant assets, offering enticing interest rates that overshadow conventional bank savings.
● Robust Community: Representing a quarter of global crypto users, KuCoin ensures dynamic liquidity and an engaging trading environment.
● Trustworthiness: Despite a hiccup with some hot wallets in 2020, KuCoin’s rapid, insured, and transparent measures re-established its security credentials.

Looking Ahead: The UK Crypto Market's Evolution
The landscape of crypto trading in the UK is undoubtedly in flux. The exits of giants like Binance and ByBit herald a new era, one where regulatory compliance is not just a guideline but a strict mandate.
In this evolving scene, platforms like Bitget, Kucoin & OKX are poised to thrive. Their adaptability to new rules and unwavering commitment to user-centric operations position them at the forefront of the crypto market's future.
The UK's regulatory steps, while stringent, are necessary evolutions for an industry that has, at times, been like the Wild West. With a focus on user safety and informed trading, the future looks not just secure but also promising for those platforms that can navigate these waters with agility and user trust.

The landscape of crypto trading in the UK is undoubtedly in flux. The exits of giants like Binance and ByBit herald a new era, one where regulatory compliance is not just a guideline but a strict mandate.
In this evolving scene, platforms like Bitget, Kucoin & OKX are poised to thrive. Their adaptability to new rules and unwavering commitment to user-centric operations position them at the forefront of the crypto market's future.
The UK's regulatory steps, while stringent, are necessary evolutions for an industry that has, at times, been like the Wild West. With a focus on user safety and informed trading, the future looks not just secure but also promising for those platforms that can navigate these waters with agility and user trust.

FTX Billion-Dollar Fraud: Expert Figures Out Where The Missing $9 Billion Went;"The trial of the former CEO of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), continued on October 18 with the direct examination of the prosecution’s expert witness, Peter Easton, an Accounting Professor who works at the University of Notre Dame. 
According to a report by Bloomberg, Easton explained that $9 billion in customers’ funds had already gone missing since June 2022, five months before FTX filed for bankruptcy. He specifically alluded to the customers’ deposits, which were made into Alameda Research’s bank accounts. 
Having laid a foundation that Bankman-Fried stole FTX’s customers’ funds through Alameda, the next step in the prosecution’s case was to show that these funds were indeed stolen, and that was the role of Easton, who has an expertise in “penetrating the details of financial statements.” 
He stated that based on deposits made by customers, Alameda was meant to have held $11.3 billion in FTX customers’ funds, but only $2.3 billion was actually in the trading firm’s bank accounts. According to him, these funds were ultimately used for several purposes.

Easton further provided details as to where some of these funds went. He alleged that some of these funds were used to invest in companies like Anthony Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital, Lily Zhang’s Modulo Capital, Robinhood, Dave and Anthropic. 
Specifically, he stated that the investment in Modulo was 100% from customers’ funds, with him being able to trace the transaction from FTX’s database.
While giving her testimony, Alameda’s ex-CEO, Caroline Ellison, also revealed that Alameda, with SBF’s permission, used FTX’s customers’ funds to repay its lenders. Easton corroborated this statement as he mentioned that some of the missing funds were used to repay lenders like Celsius, Abra, Maple, and Anchorage. 
His testimony didn’t stop there, though, as, according to him, some of the funds were also used to fund political campaigns, charity foundations, and real estate purchases. Part of these political contributions included the $1 million that FTX’s Director of Engineering Nishad Singh had donated to Mind The Gap (MTG), a Political Action Committee (PAC) that SBF’s mum Barbara Fried co-founded. 
Additionally, $96 million of these customers’ funds is said to have been spent on real estate purchases, of which a property owned by SBF’s parents happens to be among them, going by the evidence tendered by the prosecution. 
The professor mentioned that all these discoveries were made following his analysis of Alameda’s statements, information from the FTX database, documents from lenders, and on-chain data.

SEC’s Gensler weighs in on pending Bitcoin ETF applications: Details;"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler offered a few new insights into the highly-anticipated approval process for spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) during a recent interview with Bloomberg TV. Without delving into specifics, Gensler stated that the SEC staff is “doing work on those multiple filings.” Moreover, the SEC Chair declined to offer any commentary on the regulatory body’s ongoing case against Grayscale Investments following last month’s court ruling, which the company chose not to appeal.
Asset management giants such as BlackRock, Invesco, Valkyrie, and Fidelity are in a holding pattern as the SEC has instituted additional proceedings to determine the fate of their proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs. These proceedings suggest that the agency is opting for a meticulous approach, potentially adding at least another month to the already-in-progress review processes. Additionally, Gensler wouldn’t confirm if the SEC would approve a single fund first or wait for a comprehensive group approval.
In his discussion with Bloomberg TV, Gensler emphasized that multiple filings, perhaps as many as eight or ten, are currently under review. He explained that these are not just routine applications but involve significant deliberation from different divisions within the SEC. Specifically, the Division of Corporation Finance provides feedback, and the Division of Trading and Markets scrutinizes the filings in detail.
What makes this prolonged review particularly noteworthy is the history of the process itself. Gensler pointed out that it’s a “time-tested process” going back decades. He also pointed out that the SEC staff involved in these evaluations constitute the Disclosure Review Team. This team is responsible for responding and offering feedback to potential issuers of such financial products.
In the wider context, this ongoing review by the SEC does reflect broader questions about cryptocurrency regulation. While the world watches eagerly, the U.S. financial watchdog remains cautiously circumspect. The SEC has not set a definite timeline for these decisions, thus keeping the asset management firms and, indeed, the larger financial community in a state of anticipatory suspense.
Importantly, Gensler’s comments do underscore the sense of responsibility that the SEC feels in ensuring that any approved financial products meet stringent regulatory criteria. Hence, as the waiting game continues, all eyes remain on the SEC for the next chapter in this unfolding narrative.

Coinbase Says Pushing Crypto Offshore May Increase Amount of Illicit Activity;"The largest US-based crypto exchange wants to prevent crypto from thriving in offshore jurisdictions.
In a new blog post, Coinbase says leaving crypto to flourish abroad where entities are not subject to US laws will only enable bad actors to easily use digital assets for illicit purposes.
“We maintain a robust compliance program, which includes KYC (know your customer) checks, sanctions screening, suspicious activity reporting, and strong law enforcement partnerships, to prevent and detect illicit activity on our platform. Further, blockchain analytics technology allows us to trace, report, and even prevent terrorist financing. This is why it’s critical to prevent crypto from thriving offshore.”
The statement comes amid reports that the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which launched devastating attacks on Israel on October 7th, initiated a fundraising campaign on social networks asking the public to deposit cryptocurrencies into its accounts.
“The reports of Hamas funding linked to digital assets are connected to offshore entities not subject to US laws, including anti-money laundering and sanctions regulations, making it easier for them to engage in such conduct.”
Coinbase says the US needs to retain its position as the world leader in the fight against financial crime and terrorism.
“By creating clear rules of the road, we keep crypto in the United States and other regulated jurisdictions, ensuring compliance with sanctions and anti-money laundering rules.”
According to the Financial Times, more than 100 Hamas-linked accounts have been closed on Binance since the conflict started. Israeli authorities are also looking into 200 other crypto accounts, most of which are held on the leading crypto exchange.

Ripple Attorney John Deaton’s Take on SEC’s Bitcoin ETF Stance;"The post Ripple Attorney John Deaton’s Take on SEC’s Bitcoin ETF Stance appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The recent shift in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) terminology and tone surrounding the spot Bitcoin ETF is addressed by Ripple’s XRP attorney, John Deaton. He surmises that Gary Gensler may have personal motives for the SEC’s shift in stance on approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. Positive discussions on the necessary adjustments to identify Bitcoin ETF applications have been in place between the issuers and the SEC. 
These discussions ensure the necessary adjustments are made to meet the SEC’s regulatory requirements. The issuers hope these constructive conversations will pave the way for the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF shortly. However, whether these adjustments will be sufficient for the SEC to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF soon remains unclear. 
Attorney John E. Deaton responded to a post on the social media platform X by analyst Scott Melker, which was his comment on an original post by Andrew, founder of X 3: Finance, Bitcoin, Blockchain. Better known as “The Wolf Of All Street,” Scott Melker reposted the U.S. SEC’s shift in tone and wording concerning the spot Bitcoin ETF. 
Deaton expressed his surprise and optimism regarding the SEC’s change of mind, stating that it could pave the way for a spot Bitcoin ETF to be approved soon. He emphasized the importance of regulatory clarity and how it could benefit both investors and the overall growth of the cryptocurrency market. 
“Scott is right”, says Deaton. 
“I’m someone who said I wouldn’t be surprised if the SEC wrote a long dissertation citing data or anecdotal evidence denying a spot Bitcoin ETF again, that wasn’t part of the SEC’s original denial that has been deemed arbitrarily and capricious by the Appellate Court”, commented Deaton.
Deaton thinks Gary Gensler’s take on cryptocurrency hasn’t changed. It is very possible that he still holds cryptocurrency responsible for financing terrorism or other illegal behavior.
Despite Gensler’s personal opinion, Deaton believes that the public defeat in the Grayscale case and federal judges’ criticism of the SEC’s hypocritical, arbitrary, and capricious behavior have had a significant effect on the SEC. 
Deaton commented on the causes: “I could be wrong, but I attribute it to the Court loss coupled with the Larry Fink effect.”
He thinks that Gensler is solely interested in the opinions of institutions or contributors. The crypto community contends that after serving his office in the SEC, Gensler will follow in the footsteps of former SEC Chair Jay Clayton and former SEC Director Bill Hinman and further his career at major companies like Goldman Sachs or BlackRock.

Unchained Debuts Bitcoin-Focused Financial Advisory Services;"Sound Advisory / Unchained
Unchained, a leading Bitcoin financial services provider, has launched its new service, Sound Advisory, per a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. This new platform offers registered investment advisor (RIA) services, specifically designed for investors looking to include bitcoin in their portfolios.
The introduction of Sound Advisory comes at a time when there's a growing interest from investors in BTC. Moreover, there's a clear gap in the market for financial advisors who specialize in bitcoin.
With Sound Advisory, Unchained seeks to give clients access to financial planners who deeply understand the nuances of bitcoin. These advisors will help clients plan their bitcoin investments, navigate potential tax issues, and set up inheritance plans. The primary goal is to provide clients with a smooth experience in their bitcoin investment journey. Moreover, the company stresses that they prioritize clients' best interests and always keep legal considerations in mind.
""Sound Advisory reflects the foundational values Unchained is built upon: technical expertise, financial sovereignty, and a relentless commitment to clients’ financial well-being,"" said Joe Kelly, co-founder and CEO of Unchained. ""Traditional advisors have overlooked bitcoin for too long, and Sound Advisory is here to help solve the many financial planning questions and challenges that bitcoin holders face. As bitcoin and legacy finance continue to intertwine, it’s critical for the industry to offer a bitcoin-native solution for professional financial guidance.""
This year, bitcoin has stood out as a top-performing asset. Current research shows that portfolios with BTC often perform better. This growing interest in bitcoin is leading investors to seek strategies to tap into its benefits while managing the risks. Data suggests that financial advisors can add up to 4% or more to annual portfolio returns. This fact highlights the importance of expert guidance, especially given bitcoin's known volatility.
Sound Advisory's team of Certified Financial Planners (CFP®) are ready to offer advice on integrating bitcoin into personalized financial plans. Clients can also benefit from Unchained’s innovative custody technology, ensuring they have full control over their assets. Breaking from traditional models, Sound Advisory introduces a value-for-value fee system, moving away from fees based on portfolio size or net worth.

Binance Burns $501 Million Worth of BNB in 25th Quarterly Burn;"Binance has successfully carried out its 25th quarterly BNB burn, destroying almost $501 million worth of tokens. The burn also includes tokens from the “Auto Burn” and the “Pioneer Burn” program. As per an official report, a total of 2,139,182.98 BNB tokens were incinerated. Of the total, 314.69 BNB were from the Pioneer Burn program, while the real burns (Auto Burn – Pioneer Burn) totaled 2,138,868.29 BNB. 
The latest burn as the biggest in terms of BNB destroyed in almost two years. During the 24th quarterly burn event in July of this year, the exchage burned about $484 million worth of BNB. Although in Q1, the firm burned $676 million worth of BNB, the number of tokens was less as prices were high. 
BNB’s price seems to have positively reacted to the burns. The token’s price has spiked by 2.7% in the last 24 hours and by 1% on the weekly charts. Meanwhile, the token’s 24-hour volume has spiked by 83.13%. 
Also Read: Binance & Israeli Police Collaborate To Stop Hamas-Linked Crypto Funds
Nonetheless, BNB continues to be among the poorer performers in 2023. Since the beginning of the year, BNB has fallen by almost 13.6%. On the other hand, Bitcoin (BTC) has risen by almost 60%, while Solana’s (SOL) price has increased by almost 120%. 
BNB is the native token for Binance’s BNB Chain ecosystem. Moreover, it acts as the native coin for the BNB Beacon Chain, the BNB Smart Chain, and the opBNB L2s and BNB Greenfield blockchain. Upon BNB’s launch in 2017, the team had made a commitment to remove 100 million tokens from circulation via burns. The aim was to keep only 100 million BNB in circulation. This commitment is honored every quarter with a BNB burn. 
The latest burn suggests that Binance’s ecsystem is thriving despite legal worries that surrpund the exchange. CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was recently caught up in a crypto scam in Brazil. However, the company has denied the allegations.

At press time, BNB was trading at $213.04, up by 0.1% in the last hour.

The Mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto: Explore the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin;"
In the world of cryptocurrency, only a few names hold as much intrigue and mystique as Satoshi Nakamoto. If you are enjoying the benefits of the crypto Bitcoin, then this is the person or persons to thank.
We bet you are a bit confused there, and rightfully so. To this day, no one can really claim to know the identity behind Bitcoin. It remains shrouded in secrecy, raising questions that continue to captivate the minds of enthusiasts, researchers, and the general public alike. 
Here are five lesser-known facts about Satoshi Nakamoto that add to the intrigue:
It is uncertain whether Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous originator of Bitcoin, possesses proficiency in the Japanese language. The selection of the moniker “Satoshi Nakamoto” has prompted conjecture regarding potential ties to Japan, as both “Satoshi” and “Nakamoto” are widespread Japanese names. 
Yet, apart from this linguistic association, there exists no substantial proof to affirm or disprove Nakamoto’s aptitude in Japanese or any other languages.
Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous architect behind Bitcoin, was engaged in email correspondence with Hal Finney, a renowned cryptographer and one of the initial contributors to the Bitcoin initiative. These email dialogues offer valuable insights into the nascent stages of Bitcoin’s development and Nakamoto’s interactions within the cryptographic community.
Hal Finney, who commanded respect in cryptographic circles, held dual roles as both a revered cryptographer and a proficient programmer. He stood among the pioneers who downloaded and operated the Bitcoin software early on, playing an indispensable role in collaborating during the project’s formative phase.
The email exchanges shared between Nakamoto and Finney primarily revolved around in-depth technical conversations concerning the Bitcoin protocol. Their discussions spanned a spectrum of subjects, including software intricacies, design considerations, potential enhancements, and strategies for mitigating potential vulnerabilities.
Nakamoto exhibited coding practices marked by precision and thoroughness. Scrutinizing the original Bitcoin source code unveils an elevated level of intricacy and deliberate design decisions. Nakamoto’s coding style implies a profound grasp of cryptography and computer science.
Although Nakamoto’s identity remains veiled, their communication patterns offer hints. Examination of forums and mailing lists utilized for Bitcoin discourse reveals Nakamoto’s involvement with the global community, spanning various time zones. This suggests either a flexible personal schedule or the potential presence of a geographically dispersed team contributing to the project.
Satoshi Nakamoto preserved their anonymity right from the inception of Bitcoin. From their initial contributions on cryptography forums to the unveiling of the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008, Nakamoto consistently utilized a pseudonym. 
This early determination to remain incognito implies a deliberate intention to dissociate their actual identity from their involvement in Bitcoin’s development.
However, despite these intriguing initial insights, the genuine identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains an enduring enigma. The choice to withdraw from active engagement in the project, the decision to uphold anonymity, and the absence of confirmable personal particulars collectively contribute to the air of mystery encircling the originator of Bitcoin.
As the landscape of cryptocurrency evolves, the legacy of Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation perseveres, serving as a wellspring of inspiration for innovation and kindling curiosity across the global community.
In 2010, Nakamoto slowly receded from public view, halting interactions with the community. Despite Bitcoin’s continued expansion and increasing acceptance, Nakamoto’s withdrawal further intensified the puzzle encompassing their identity.
However, despite this absence, Nakamoto’s imprint as the architect of the inaugural cryptocurrency remains an integral facet of the digital era’s narrative.
Over time, an array of conspiracy theories has surfaced concerning the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. Certain theories posit that Nakamoto’s anonymity serves as a shield against potential legal or financial consequences, whereas others advance the notion that intelligence agencies or even multinational enterprises played a role in the genesis of Bitcoin.
The enigmatic puzzle of Satoshi Nakamoto persists as a mesmerizing riddle, compelling numerous individuals to hunt for hints, dissect linguistic nuances, and dissect the initial phases of Bitcoin’s evolution. Despite the persona concealed by the pseudonym, Nakamoto’s invention has permanently reshaped our perspectives on currency, technology, and the possibilities of decentralized innovation. 
In tandem with the evolution of the cryptocurrency realm, the enigmatic legacy of Satoshi Nakamoto endures, kindling ongoing dialogues and igniting novel pathways of exploration within the domain of digital currencies and blockchain technology.

Financial Fears Trigger Bank Run in China As Officials Push To Prevent Contagion: Report;"Chinese authorities are moving to prevent further financial contagion as a bank run unfolds in one of its provinces.
Thousands of customers lined up to withdraw their money amid worries the Bank of Cangzhou is at risk of going under, CNN reports, citing state-run Chinese media.
The regional bank lent hundreds of millions of dollars to Evergrande, a massive Chinese property developer that went bankrupt last year.
In a statement, the bank says its risk and exposure to Evergrande is manageable.
“The overall risk is controllable and will not have a significant impact on the Bank’s operations, management and asset quality. 
In order to recover the loan in full, our bank filed a civil lawsuit with the Cangzhou Intermediate People’s Court in July 2022 and won the lawsuit, and is currently executing the collateral disposal procedures in accordance with the law.”
However, the bank’s statement wasn’t enough to calm the public’s fear of a potential collapse, and police in Cangzhou arrested “many people” who were suspected of allegedly spreading false rumors about the bank’s exposure to Evergrande.
The bank run comes as The South China Morning Post reports that the Chinese government has taken new action to prevent contagion stemming from the country’s property crisis, which was partially triggered by the collapse of Evergrande.
Authorities are reportedly preparing to help replenish capital at commercial banks and rural financial institutions, while also aiding them in disposing of bad assets and loans. Some local governments have also issued new special-purpose bonds to help smaller banks raise money.
As part of the move to stop contagion, banks are now banned from operating outside of their designated regions.
China’s National Administration of Financial Regulation made a statement saying that more resources needed to be diverted to “rural revitalization” and agriculture to build up the country’s economy.
“[It is necessary] to focus on developing agricultural insurance, commercial pension insurance and health insurance products to support agricultural production, pension needs and basic livelihood security…
Comprehensively promoting rural revitalization is an important task in building a strong agricultural country in the new era. More financial resources must be allocated to the agricultural sector.”

XRP Price Set For Massive Rally As BlackRock And JPMorgan Make Their Move;"Amid the struggles in the cryptocurrency market, recent reports have suggested that the world’s largest asset manager Blackrock, and financial giant JPMorgan might spark a massive bull run for the XRP price as they work simultaneously.
According to the report, Forbes Senior Contributor, Billy Bambrough, highlighted that Blackrock and JPMorgan are purportedly laying the foundation for an impending surge in the cryptocurrency sector. The report further identified several collaborative cryptocurrency moves taken by the two financial powerhouse firms.
Bambrough pointed out a recent report that claims that the asset manager recently utilized JPMorgan’s Ethereum-based Onyx network and tokenized collateral service. 
Blackrock reportedly used the network to tokenize shares from one of its financial market funds, which was later transferred to the London-based Barclays in an over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trade.
Over-the-counter (OTC) derivative operations occur between two parties. However,  the specifics of the order quantity, cost, and other information of Blockrock’s transactions with Barclays remain concealed from the public.
Following the report by Bambrough, it was revealed that Blackrock became the first Wall Street giant to make use of JPMorgan’s blockchain-based collateral settlement system. This was part of a move that Blackrock’s Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, has stated will pave the way for the “next generation for markets.”
The Blackrock CEO’s previous statement in an annual letter to shareholders where he emphasized blockchain technology as “very important” in the past year was also mentioned in the report. Fink highlighted the role that blockchain technology plays in their financial operations.
Blockchain technology enables traditional assets to be “tokenized” on a public ledger, potentially simplifying and lowering the cost of transferring anything from stocks and bonds to real estate and alternative investments like art.
Due to this, Billy Bambrough believes that there will be a significant increase in the price of digital assets such as XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) as a result of BlackRock and JPMorgan entering the cryptocurrency industry, considering their connections to the traditional market. In addition, Ripple is also aiming to establish the XRP Ledger as a crucial platform for the tokenization of real-world assets.
BlackRock using XRP would not doubt have an immense impact on the XRP price. An example of the kind of rally it could trigger is what happened back in June with Bitcoin when the asset manager announced it had filed for a Spot Bitcoin ETF.
So far, Blackrock’s partnering with JPMorgan marks a new milestone for the financial firm. Blackrock’s recent transaction via JPMorgan’s blockchain indicates a crucial contribution to the volume of the Ethereum-based network Onyx.
Additionally, the operation could unveil a new world of possibilities for established financial institutions which enables them to free up capital and boost efficiency across separate markets, as a spokesman from JPMorgan told Bloomberg.
JPMorgan’s Head of Trading Service Ed Bond, also stated that “institutions on the network can use a wider scope of assets to meet any collateral requirements they have on the back of trading.”

Grayscale Submits An S-3 Filing With SEC For Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval, Ahead Of Friday’s Court Mandate;"The post Grayscale Submits An S-3 Filing With SEC For Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval, Ahead Of Friday’s Court Mandate appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Ahead of tomorrow’s crucial court mandate on spot Bitcoin ETF approval, Grayscale Investments has made a bold move as it submitted an S-3 filing with the SEC. This document represents a registration statement, submitted in Form S-3, aiming to register shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (OTCQX: GBTC) in accordance with the Securities Act of 1933, in its current amended version (referred to as the “Securities Act”).
In its continuous effort to transform the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale Investments has recently registered a new statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This development follows a directive from a D.C. circuit court that the regulatory body reassess the company’s proposal.
On Thursday, Grayscale advanced its strategy by submitting a concise S-3 filing, commonly used for new share offerings, amid efforts by industry giants like BlackRock and Fidelity to secure SEC approval for their spot Bitcoin ETFs.
GBTC plans to register its shares on NYSE Arca, using the ticker GBTC, and will continually issue shares upon the approval of NYSE Arca’s Form 19b-4 application for listing and the activation of the Form S-3 registration for the shares.
Grayscale confirmed its eligibility to utilize Form S-3 for its submission, citing its shares’ registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 since January 2020 and compliance with other requirements. This filing comes ahead of an anticipated court mandate from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, expected tomorrow, which will essentially reinforce its preliminary decision from August, marking a conclusive step in the proceedings.
The absence of an appeal from the SEC regarding the court’s decision last week sparked industry-wide hope for an imminent spot Bitcoin ETF. Nonetheless, several steps remain before such a product enters the market.
So far, nine fund managers have submitted applications for spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Grayscale has emerged as a leader, securing a significant legal triumph against the SEC in its effort to transition the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.
On October 20, Friday, the court that sided with Grayscale is set to deliver a mandate to the SEC, potentially compelling the regulator to respond following months of inaction on Bitcoin ETF applications.
The court’s upcoming decision will determine if the SEC must revisit Grayscale’s ETF application due to recent rulings, potentially avoiding a reapplication. This situation coincides with a sudden change in the SEC’s approach.
Ark Invest’s CEO, Cathie Woods, highlighted this in a CNBC interview, noting the regulator’s recent engagement with her company’s Bitcoin ETF application, a marked shift from their previous position.

Solana (SOL) Price Primed For 50% Surge: Bullish Pattern Emerges;"Renowned crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz recently spotlighted an extremely bullish technical pattern for Solana (SOL) price, suggesting a potential significant uptrend for the cryptocurrency against the US dollar (SOL/USD). Olszewicz shared his analysis on X (formerly Twitter), commenting, “SOL iHS alert. Chart is the chart, love it or hate. Looks a helluva lot better than spot ETH that’s for sure.”
After reaching a peak of $260 in November 2021, the Solana price experienced a steep decline in value, plummeting to a low of $8 by the end of 2022. This decline mirrored the general downturn in the crypto market, which was further aggravated by the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, with SOL being particularly affected.
However, 2023 began with a positive twist for Solana. The price of SOL rebounded from its $8 low to almost $26 within the first half of January, setting the stage for the formation of an inverse head and shoulders (H&S) pattern.
This inverse H&S pattern, recognized as a typical bullish reversal signal, began taking shape in mid-January and extended through October 2023. By mid-March, the left shoulder was evident, with the head forming in early June, and the right shoulder becoming prominent in October.
A significant feature of this pattern is the neckline resistance, identified at around the $25.81 mark. Solana’s price has already challenged this resistance multiple times, and a decisive breach above this threshold would serve as a strong indicator of a bullish trend reversal. Olszewicz, in his analysis, marked the stop loss (SL) for this trade idea just below the right shoulder, specifically around $19.30.
Using Fibonacci extensions, Olszewicz charted potential price trajectories for SOL, should it successfully surpass the $25.81 neckline. The targets are marked at the 1.618 ($33.85) and 2.0 ($38.82) Fibonacci levels. If these predictions hold, traders might be looking at potential profits ranging between 35% and 55% from the current price.
Additional insights from the Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) reveal that the most substantial trading activity for SOL is clustered around the $14 to $15 bracket. Another volume cluster is situated between the $20.83 and $19.30 marks, aligning with Olszewicz’s stop loss placement.
Another important takeaway is that should SOL break above the inverse H&S pattern’s neckline, there is a large volume gap up to the first price target at $33.85 where the 1.618 Fibonacci level is situated, suggesting this area is of significant interest and potential resistance.
In conclusion, while the inverse H&S pattern’s emergence paints a super bullish picture for Solana’s price trajectory, it is essential to await a confirmed breakout above the $25.81 neckline, ideally supported by a substantial trading volume, before confirming the bullish projections laid out by Olszewicz.
At press time, SOL rose above 200-day EMA and traded at $23.81.

At press time, SOL rose above 200-day EMA and traded at $23.81.

Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Bulls Secure Gains, Following a Recent Multi-Month High;"Bitcoin stalled in today’s session, as traders consolidated gains, following a recent two-month high. The global market cap is trading 0.01% lower as of writing, with the cryptocurrency remaining above the $28,000 level. Ethereum has been marginally higher, and continues to hover around the $1,580 region.
Bitcoin bulls consolidated recent gains on Wednesday, as traders appeared to be capturing profits following recent highs.
BTC/USD edged to a low of $28,172.91 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after a high of $28,889.01.
Today’s price consolidation comes after the world’s largest cryptocurrency rose to as high as $30,000 earlier in the week.


Looking at the chart, the decline comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) maintains its position marginally above a floor at the 62.00 level.
As of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 62.28, after a failed breakout from a resistance of 65.00 on Monday.
Price may continue to consolidate until either the aforementioned floor or ceiling is broken.
Ethereum (ETH) made slight gains on hump-day, as it continued to hover around the $1,580 mark.
Following a low of $1,554.40 on Tuesday, ETH/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $1,584.73 during the day.
Earlier gains have since eased, with ethereum now trading at $1,577.40, with short-term bulls still targeting the $1,600 zone.


This may be difficult to achieve as momentum appears to be bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average continuing to trend downwards.
Whilst at a reading of 45.75, a ceiling awaits ETH’s price strength at the 49.00 zone, and should it move beyond this, there will likely be an influx of bulls.

Bitcoin’s Price Could Reach $675,000 if This Happens;"TL;DR

Fidelity Digital Assets recently published a Bitcoin study conducted in September. The cryptocurrency arm of the $4.5 trillion financial giant is very bullish for Bitcoin over the long term.
Here are some of the implications of Fidelity’s study for Bitcoin price.
Among the key findings and conclusions of the study are:
Chris Kuiper, Fidelity Digital’s director of research and research analyst Jack Neureuter authored the study. They make the case that Bitcoin is an entirely unique asset class but that it combines the best of gold and digital assets.
The digital gold thesis goes all the way back to the seminal Bitcoin white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto:
“The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.”
The Fidelity study’s ultimate conclusion is Bitcoin is a unique asset class and even better than gold as a long-term store of value.
The Fidelity team proposes in their paper that “Bitcoin’s value is driven by its enforceable scarcity.” Furthermore, they point out Bitcoin price’s inflation rate is right on par with gold prices:
“Not only is bitcoin scarce (bitcoin’s current inflation rate of about 1.8% is roughly equal to gold’s inflation rate at the moment), but unlike gold, it is also provably finite. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.”
Gold’s global market cap is currently somewhere in the neighborhood of $13 trillion for just over 200,000 above-ground metric tons of gold:
“The amount of above ground reserves for Gold are estimated to be around 205,238 metric tonnes according to the World Gold Council…”
If Bitcoin were to someday overtake gold in market capitalization, based on the Bitcoin supply of some 19 million bitcoins that have been mined, it could fetch a price as high as $676,000 per 1 BTC.
At a recent Bitcoin price of $28,400, that would be nearly 24X the current value of the world’s original cryptocurrency. In the near to mid-term, here are six important factors in BTC’s price.

Bitcoin Market Cap Can Surge 5x as Financial Titans Circle Spot BTC ETFs: CryptoQuant;"Bitcoin briefly soared toward $30,000 following a false spot Bitcoin ETF approval information before swiftly retreating to the $28,000 level. But an actual approval could add $1 trillion to the crypto market, according to the latest report by CryptoQuant.
The next wave of Bitcoin institutional adoption appears to be advancing in the form of financial institutions offering access to the flagship cryptocurrency investing to their clients via spot Bitcoin ETFs.
Several companies, such as BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, Fidelity, and Valkyrie, among others, have applied to launch spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). While these are not expected to get approvals this year, industry experts believe green lights could be on the horizon, potentially as early as March 2024.
In this case, Bitcoin could witness inflows of $155 billion. The entry of fresh money could further boost Bitcoin’s market cap by $450-$900 billion, CryptoQuant said in its latest report.
“We could expect $155 billion will flow into the Bitcoin market once these ETFs are approved. The total Assets Under Management (AUM) of these companies are around $15.6 trillion. If they were to put 1% of their AUM into these Bitcoin ETFs, the total US dollar amount that would enter the Bitcoin market would be ~$155 Billion. To put it in context, these amounts represent almost a third of the current market capitalization of Bitcoin.”
In past bull markets, Bitcoin’s market capitalization has typically expanded at a rate of 3 to 5 times higher than its realized capitalization. This implies that for each additional dollar entering the Bitcoin market, the market capitalization could potentially grow by 3x to 5x, CryptoQuant explained.
Furthermore, the anticipated capital influx from spot ETFs is poised to surpass the funds that flowed into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) during the previous bull market cycle. Operated by Digital Currency Group (DCG), GBTC is currently the world’s largest cryptocurrency fund, managing over 620k BTC holdings.
Misleading reports concerning BlackRock’s spot ETF approval created a stir in the cryptocurrency market earlier this week. But the overall sentiment remains strong.
The bullish outlook is also evident in the ongoing reduction of the discount on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which hit its lowest point in 22 months last Friday. The narrowing discount has ignited optimism as spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States edge closer to becoming a reality.

Ethereum Price Defies Gravity, Here’s What Could Spark Bullish Moves;"Ethereum price managed to stay above the $1,520 support against the US dollar. ETH is rising and might rally if it clears the $1,605 resistance.
Ethereum managed to stay above the main breakdown support at $1,520. The recent rise in XRP is sparking a recovery wave in the crypto market. ETH managed to start an increase above the $1,550 and $1,565 resistance levels, like Bitcoin.
There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,562 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,542 low.
Ethereum is now trading above $1,565 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,600 level.
The first major resistance is near the $1,605 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,542 low. The next key resistance is $1,620. A close above the $1,605 and $1,620 resistance levels might start a steady increase.

Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com
In the stated case, Ether could start a recovery wave toward the $1,665 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750.
If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,605 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,575 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
The next key support is $1,540. The main support is still near $1,520. A downside break below the $1,520 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,440 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,350 level in the medium term.
Technical Indicators
Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.
Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.
Major Support Level – $1,575
Major Resistance Level – $1,605

Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin (BTC) ‘Fighting Crucial Levels’, Does a Deep Dive Into the Altcoin Cycle;"A widely followed crypto analyst is breaking down Bitcoin’s (BTC) trajectory while taking a hard look at the altcoin cycle.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 668,800 followers on the social media platform X that BTC is in the midst of “fighting crucial levels.”
“Bitcoin fighting crucial levels. 
A retest around $27,700 would still be possible, while Gold is continuing the upwards run.
Above $28,800 and we’ll be eager towards $30,000 in a matter of time.”
In the analyst’s opinion, it might not be so bad if BTC were to consolidate for a period.
“Bitcoin is not following through, and to be fair, I’d rather want to see it consolidate here for a few days before continuing.
Taking out some liquidity on the long side, through which a test at $27,600-27,800 seems likely. 
Both $27,700 and $27,300 are long regions.”
BTC is worth $28,668 at time of writing.
Moving on to the altcoin markets, Van de Poppe says alts are in the middle of the last phase of the bear cycle.
“Altcoins are in the last part of the bear cycle. 
Yes, it feels relatively painful. The sentiment is completely gone, no interest in crypto. 
The only thing moving is Bitcoin and, yet, that one needs to crack some levels.”
The analyst says this bear market has been the longest-lasting one for altcoins. In the current geopolitical climate, and with US regulators considering the approval of a Spot BTC exchange-traded fund, Van de Poppe thinks BTC is likely to move up.
“Through that, the upside is significantly in Bitcoin and other altcoins. Bitcoin is the first-runner, almost always. People buy altcoins when there’s confidence in the markets, but if you look at the bigger ones, like Chainlink, or Solana, or Injective. 
They all start to trend upwards already. Ethereum is showing weakness all over the place as there was a lot more hope into the ETH ETF Futures launch, which didn’t happen. 
Right now, Ethereum is finalizing the final correction on the Bitcoin pair, hence why we can see the Bitcoin dominance continuing the surge at this point.”
According to the analyst, BTC’s upcoming halving event will likely set off the altcoin markets.
“A few months prior to the Bitcoin halving, that was the altcoin bottom. 
History will most likely repeat itself.”

Fake BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Report Triggers $65M BTC Liquidation;"Misinformation strikes again in crypto as false reports of an approved Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock led to over $65 million in liquidations on exchanges within minutes.
The debunked information first circulated on social media, claiming the SEC had greenlit a spot Bitcoin ETF product by BlackRock. The fake post sparked enough attention to push Bitcoin from $27,900 to almost $30,000.
Also read: BlackRock: Spot Bitcoin ETF Application Still Under Review by SEC
But prices quickly retreated to $28,000 as it became clear the report was bogus, leading leveraged traders who bought the peak to get liquidated when unable to meet margin requirements.
JUST IN: $65 million $BTC liquidated within minutes following fake reports that BlackRock's Spot #Bitcoin ETF was approved. pic.twitter.com/Uxb6pCfhdu
According to data from Coinglass, the cascade of liquidations totaled $71.36 million as the brief crypto rally rapidly reversed course. The overall liquidation at press time ever since the fake news dropped stood at $114.7 million.
Lookonchain data showed that the FOMO caused many users to lose money. A whale bought 20.5 WBTC using 613,201 USDC. However, they would sell it for a loss of $49k in just 10 minutes.
This painful lesson highlights the risks inherent in reacting hastily to unverified information in a volatile crypto market. While potential SEC approval of a Bitcoin ETF generates great excitement, traders must exercise caution when momentum spikes on flimsy evidence.

XRP Path To Recovery: Will $0.5 Be Conquered?;"XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, has been grappling with renewed supply pressure, with its price circling around the $0.5 mark, indicating that the prevailing downtrend is likely to persist. The recent pressures led to the breaking of a crucial support trendline associated with an ascending triangle pattern. This breach is a clear signal of potential bearishness for XRP in the near term.
An ascending triangle pattern is a technical chart formation frequently observed in financial markets. This pattern suggests a potential bullish breakout and often serves as an indicator of upward momentum. In an ascending triangle, the lower trendline represents an area of support, while the upper trendline is a resistance level. 
The price tends to move within these boundaries, creating a triangular shape. Traders often look for a breakout above the upper trendline as a signal to go long.
Earlier in the day, XRP made an impressive surge in price, gaining nearly 4% and reaching the $0.51 level. However, this local peak was short-lived, as the coin retraced its steps shortly after. It attempted another ascent but remained trapped in a volatile cycle. As of the latest data, XRP is trading at approximately $0.493742, reflecting a 24-hour gain of 0.9% but a seven-day loss of 1.6%.
This rollercoaster ride in XRP’s price was triggered by recent news surrounding the American securities regulator’s supposed approval of the iShares Bitcoin spot ETF. This ETF was initially filed by BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager. The news initially posted on various crypto media outlets gained credibility when Reuters and Bloomberg Terminal picked it up. Consequently, Bitcoin surged by 10% in response to this development. 

However, BlackRock soon issued a statement refuting the news, clarifying that their BTC ETF is still under consideration by the regulatory authorities, including SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. This retracement in Bitcoin’s price had a ripple effect, impacting XRP and other altcoins.
Blackrock has confirmed with Fox that their ETF filing is still under review

XRP’s current price analysis suggests that if it falls below today’s low of $0.485, the altcoin could experience a further decline of approximately 6%. The next support level is anticipated at $0.458, with a worst-case scenario potentially driving the price down to $0.42.
The crypto market is known for its inherent volatility, and sudden reversals are not uncommon. As investors and traders navigate these uncertain waters, it is imperative to stay informed and exercise caution in their financial decisions.

Over 100 Binance Accounts Closed by Israeli Authorities Over Suspicion of Facilitating Funding to Hamas: Report;"Top global crypto exchange Binance has reportedly closed more than 100 accounts in response to Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel earlier this month.
According to a recent report from the Financial Times, which cited “people directly familiar with Israel’s enforcement actions,” Israeli law enforcement agencies ordered the closures and seized millions worth of crypto in an effort to cut funding to the Palestinian Islamist group.
Hamas has previously asked its supporters to send Bitcoin (BTC) in an effort to evade US sanctions.
The FT’s sources also reported that Israeli authorities have asked for info on up to 200 additional crypto accounts. The majority of those accounts were also reportedly set up on Binance.
Binance confirmed in a statement to the FT that it had blocked “a small number” of accounts.
On Monday, Tether, the issuer of the top stablecoin USDT, announced that it had frozen 32 addresses “linked to terrorism and warfare in Israel and Ukraine.” The addresses reportedly contained more than $870,000.
Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino argues that crypto isn’t a tool for criminals.
“Tether remains committed to promoting responsible blockchain technology use and standing as a robust defense against cybercrime. We eagerly anticipate continued collaboration with global law enforcement agencies as part of our commitment to global security and financial integrity.”

Shiba Inu Whale Moves $32.4 Million In SHIB, Large Sell Incoming?;"Shiba Inu’s ecosystem hasn’t been spared from the crypto market volatility in recent weeks, as the price has been caught in a whirlwind of uncertainty in recent times. While investors are still wondering about the short-term outlook of the crypto, a Shiba Inu whale has gone ahead to move $32.4 million in SHIB tokens into an unknown wallet. 
This whale transfer appears to have generated interest from SHIB investors, considering the relatively quiet environment within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The sheer size of this transaction is notable and worth monitoring, as a selloff could introduce selling pressure and negatively impact SHIB’s price, even if temporary. 
However, sometimes whales will move their funds around between wallets for various reasons other than buying and selling. It would seem like this is the case, as an in-depth look into the transactions shows the transfer could’ve been between wallets controlled by the same entity.  
  4,587,030,677,374 #SHIB (32,409,665 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/Mbf5ejiaYb
— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 16, 2023
According to on-chain data, the transaction was made from the address “0xe9bb” into a new private address “0x44a8”. The recipient wallet “0x44a8” now holds a total of over 4.58 trillion SHIB, worth more than $33 million at the time of writing. Address “0xe9bb” had initially received the tokens from “0xA863” before transferring it out to “0x44a8” in less than 10 minutes. 

This whale transfer is one of the largest SHIB transactions this month. But while whale movements tend to reveal the current market sentiment, a single transfer cannot necessarily move the entire market, even if there’s a selloff. 
As a result, Shiba Inu’s price hasn’t reacted much to the transfer but has lost 0.29% of its market cap in the past 24 hours. Although there’s always a possibility of the whale dumping their entire bag, this trading behavior suggests they intend to keep holding the tokens.
SHIB is currently the second-largest meme cryptocurrency, although the majority of investors are losing money at this point. As reported from data provided by IntoTheBlock, only 9% of holders are making money at the current price. 
Nevertheless, the SHIB burn rate saw a spike of 233% since the beginning of the new week as community members remain committed to reducing its available supply. 
At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.000007059. Yesterday, the value of the cryptocurrency skyrocketed to 0.000072 as a direct reaction to Bitcoin crossing the $29,000 threshold. However, the meme coin has retraced most of its gains from Monday. It is down 0.61% in the last 24 hours, but seeing 1.97% gains on the weekly chart.

Spot Bitcoin ETF is Inevitable: Jay Clayton (Throwback Thursday);"TL;DR
Jay Clayton, who served as SEC chair from 2017 to 2020, said recently in September that the “dichotomy between a futures product and cash product can’t go on forever.”

As a result, he believes a spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission is “inevitable.”
Earlier this year, in July, he also said approving a Bitcoin ETF would be “hard to resist.” He says that’s because institutional players are chomping at the bit to get access to Bitcoin investments:
“Bitcoin is something that retail investors want access to, the institutional investors want access to, and importantly, some of our most trusted providers want to provide this product to the retail public.”
Months of pent-up institutional demand could see a massive bull run of hedge funds into the Bitcoin market via an SEC-approved Bitcoin ETF.
The Bitcoin price briefly spiked 10% to the $30,000 level on a false alarm this Monday that the SEC had approved a spot ETF.
So when will the SEC come around on an ETF approval?
Barron’s recently echoed Clayton, calling a Bitcoin ETF inevitable and even predicting a timeframe: “within the next few months.” However, no one knows for sure exactly.
The SEC is slow-walking the approval because of concerns that the volatility of cryptocurrency markets exposes investing clients’ portfolios to too much risk.
What will a Bitcoin ETF mean for the cryptocurrency market over the long term?
It could unleash a massive wave of sustained institutional participation from big hedge funds that don’t want to flout the SEC but want a spot Bitcoin ETF that more directly reflects Bitcoin’s performance, not a Bitcoin futures ETF.
For an idea of what a game changer this would be, just look at the impact gold ETFs had on the market when they debuted. Bitcoin, after all, is something like 21st-century digital gold.
Gold spot price was $321 an ounce on March 28, 2003, when the first gold ETF launched. Less than a month later, it rose 3.7% to $333. A year later, in March 2004, spot gold had risen 31% to $422.
After that, gold continued to rise in a multi-year bull that saw its price gain 486% by September 2011, when its price reached a peak of $1884 per ounce.

It could unleash a massive wave of sustained institutional participation from big hedge funds that don’t want to flout the SEC but want a spot Bitcoin ETF that more directly reflects Bitcoin’s performance, not a Bitcoin futures ETF.
For an idea of what a game changer this would be, just look at the impact gold ETFs had on the market when they debuted. Bitcoin, after all, is something like 21st-century digital gold.
Gold spot price was $321 an ounce on March 28, 2003, when the first gold ETF launched. Less than a month later, it rose 3.7% to $333. A year later, in March 2004, spot gold had risen 31% to $422.
After that, gold continued to rise in a multi-year bull that saw its price gain 486% by September 2011, when its price reached a peak of $1884 per ounce.

Bitcoin advances as gold and markets show resilience amid geopolitical unrest;"The recent conflict in the Middle East has surprisingly not destabilized the financial markets, as one might expect. Instead, data analysis reveals a slight increase across various financial assets. Gold, historically considered a safe haven during volatile periods, experienced a 3.31% hike. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has also increased by 1.74% since the start of the war.
The SPX, Nasdaq, and DXY indices rose by 0.88%, 0.57%, and 0.27%, respectively, evidence of sustained market confidence. WTI Crude Oil, however, exhibited noticeable volatility, plunging from $90 to $82 per barrel before the war, regaining some ground to hover around $86. The Volatility Index (VIX) presented a similar scenario, jumping to 20 on Oct. 13 and then receding to just above 17 yesterday, Oct. 16.
The high volatility of traditional financial assets like WTI Crude Oil might indicate a potential ripple effect on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Why Dogecoin, Shiba Inu & Pepe Are Crashing in 2023? Explained;"Meme coins have held a significant position within the cryptocurrency landscape. From the OG Dogecoin [DOGE] to Shiba Inu [SHIB] and Pepe Coin [PEPE], these assets have gained widespread recognition. Nonetheless, the once flourishing meme coin market has faced a setback as its overall value experienced a decline. Analysis of data indicates a substantial decrease in the meme coin market’s value, with a loss exceeding $3 billion since the onset of 2023. 
Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE have been dominating the meme coin sector for the longest time, but now appear to be crashing. The notable decline can be primarily attributed to the reduced market capitalization of these leading meme coins. 
Dogecoin also holds the position of the tenth-largest cryptocurrency in terms of overall market capitalization. At the beginning of 2023, DOGE boasted a market cap of $10.83 billion. However, its current market capitalization has dwindled to $8.47 billion, marking a significant reduction. DOGE maintains its dominance in the meme token sector, contributing 61.09% to its overall value. Over the past week, DOGE witnessed a 2.8% decline, and a month-long analysis shows a 4.4% decrease. 
Meanwhile, Shiba Inu experienced a 2.9% drop in value during the past week, and over the course of the month, it incurred a 5.4% decrease. As of Oct. 15, Shiba Inu’s market cap stands at $4.17 billion, a decrease from the $5.34 billion value at the beginning of the year. Remarkably, SHIB constitutes 30% of the $13.7 billion meme token ecosystem.

PEPE is one of the notorious meme coins that has experienced a series of fluctuations in its path since its creation. At one point, it even surpassed the $1 billion mark in market capitalization but then rapidly lost value. Nevertheless, the situation has taken a positive turn as a significant bullish signal has favored PEPE. According to LunarCrush’s data, the meme coin’s Galaxy Score ranked second only to Bitcoin [BTC], indicating the potential for a forthcoming bullish rally for the meme coin.

At press time, PEPE was trading at $0.00000068091 with a 1.6% weekly surge. The daily volume of the meme coin currently stands at $36 million. In addition, the market cap of PEPE was noted to be at $285,610,177.

Bitcoin Retests $28,000 As Large Holders Accumulate;"Bitcoin has approached a retest of the $28,000 mark in the past day as on-chain data shows that large investors have been accumulating the asset.
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the BTC investors with 100 to 1,000 BTC have sharply grown in number recently. The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the total number of coins that each investor group is holding right now.
The investors or addresses are categorized into these groups based on the amount of Bitcoin that they are carrying currently. Those holding between 1 and 10 BTC, for instance, are put in the 1-10 coins cohort.
In the context of the current discussion, the 100-1,000 BTC group is the one of focus. At the current exchange rate, this range converts to about $2.78 million at the lower bound, and $27.8 million at the upper one. The investor segments belonging to this group are the sharks and the smallest of the whales.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply Distribution of this address range over the past few months:

When Santiment shared this chart, the Supply Distribution of this Bitcoin group had just registered a sharp jump, implying that the combined holdings of these large investors had seen a rapid expansion.
During this surge, the number of sharks/small whales in the sector grew by 16 inside a 24-hour span, which is the largest increase that the metric has seen since more than a year and a half ago.
There can be two interpretations of this trend. Either there was accumulation from the smaller investors that led to them being promoted into this cohort or there was distribution from the larger groups that resulted in some of their members’ holdings dropping to this range.
In the chart, Santiment has also attached the data for the 10-100 coins group, which is the cohort just below this one. From its Supply Distribution trend, it’s clear that just as the 100-1,000 coins group rose, this smaller group saw a plunge.
This would seemingly confirm that buying indeed took place in the market, as it was some of the 10-100 coins investors who bought and increased their holdings just enough to become a part of the 100-1,000 coins group.
Interestingly, since this accumulation occurred, Bitcoin has observed a rally toward the $28,000 level. Given the close timing, it’s possible that this buying pressure helped the cryptocurrency see this growth.
Bitcoin retested the $28,000 level at the peak of this rally but has since retraced back a little. If the large investors continue to back the run in the coming days, though, the coin should jump back up in the coming days and have another go at the mark.

VeChain: What Is a Weekly $100 Investment Since Launch Worth?;"VeChain (VET), although launched in 2015, began trading in 2017. Upon launch on 22 Aug. 2017, VET was trading for about $0.24. However, this price level did not hold, as it soon fell to around $0.024 in mid-2018. It was only in 2021 that VET climbed back and beyond its 2017 price levels, reaching an all-time high of $0.28 on April 19. Since launch, if you made a $100 investment weekly into VeChain, what would it be worth now?
If you made a $100 investment in VeChain (VET) weekly from 2018 until now, you would have put in $26,400, but the amount back would be worth more. The value of the portfolio would be $39,837.66, representing a growth of about 50% and a value increase of $13,437.66. 
Also Read: VeChain: Can VET Reach $1 by 2025?
Furthermore, if you had invested $100 every week from 2018 till VET’s all-time high on April 19, 2021, you would have put in $13,300.00. However, the value would have been a whopping $495,537.34. This would have resulted in a growth of about 3625%, with a value increase of $482237.34. 
VET is currently down by almost 94% from its all-time high. Moreover, the token is down by almost 30% since October 2022. Nonetheless, VET is quite a popular crypto project. The company has collaborated with many big firms, such as Amazon, on issues that relate to the environment and climate. These aspects of the project could make it a viable investment in the long term. Climate change and environmental degradation are some of the biggest avenues for development in the near future. Hence, VET could see a major upswing in its price. 
Also Read: VeChain Price Prediction: How High Can VET Go in October 2023?
According to Changelly, VeChain (VET) will not reach $0.10 until March 2028. Moreover, according to CCN, VET may reach $0.30 by the end of this decade. However, it is too early to tell when VET will actually reclaim the ten-cent level once again. Many anticipate a crypto market rally if the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) approves a Spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund). Moreover, Bitcoin’s (BTC) halving next year may also cause a market rally. Both of these factors could help VET rally and achieve the ten-cent level faster than anticipated.

Billionaire Mike Novogratz Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) ETF Before 2024, Says Gary Gensler Feeling the Pressure;"Billionaire Mike Novogratz is predicting that a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) will hit the market before 2024 as pressure mounts on Gary Gensler, the Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In a new interview with CNBC, the Galaxy Digital CEO says that all signs point toward a spot market BTC ETF being released this year.
“It will get approved… We think it happens this year in 2023. All the indications of dealings seemed to be heading in the right direction.” 
According to Novogratz, Chair Gensler is feeling the pressure “to do something rational” now that the SEC’s stance regarding the creation of a spot Bitcoin ETF was deemed inconsistent in court.
“The most significant piece was the SEC lost in court. The judge said, ‘what are you talking about, SEC? You have a futures ETF, and you’re saying you can’t have a past ETF.’ 
That makes, intellectually, zero sense. I think that put the SEC on the back foot. I think Gensler needs a win. There’s a tremendous amount of pressure to do something that is rational. The American public wants this.”
Novogratz goes on to say that the positive news of an ETF approval coupled with a rush of institutional capital will inevitably send crypto markets higher.
“The market will head higher on any positive news. You’re going to have [the] Invesco sales force, Blackrock sales force, Cathie Wood’s sales force – all out selling Bitcoin. Bitcoin has always been an instrument that is sold, not bought.”
Bitcoin is trading for $28,257 at time of writing.

Solana: Lido Finance Shuts SOL Staking After DAO Vote;"Lido Finance will shut Solana (SOL) staking on its platform after Lido’s LDO holders voted to stop the service. About 92% of voters were in favor of halting the service. According to developers, the SOL staking service will be discontinued over the next few months. 
The developers stated via an official post, “After much discussion and a vote by Lido DAO members, it was decided that the best course of action would be to wind down Lido on Solana.” They further added, “Whilst this decision was difficult in the face of numerous strong relationships across the Solana ecosystem, it was deemed a necessity for the continued success of the broader Lido protocol ecosystem.”
However, one of the main reasons was the high cost quoted by P2P developers to keep the service running. 
Also Read: Solana (SOL) Price Prediction for Mid-October 2023
SOL staking on Lido has taken a significant slump since early 2022. According to DefiLlama, in April 2022, there were $440 million worth of SOL locked on Lido. Fast forward to today, only about $55 million worth of SOL is locked on the platform. This represents a drop of about 87%.
Despite the closure of SOL staking on Lido, the token may be gearing up for a fresh rally. According to Olszewicz, SOL is on the brink of forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern which is usually a signal for an incoming rally. Furthermore, the analyst anticipates SOL to reach $33.85 or $38.82 in the coming days.

SOL has been one of the best-performing cryptos this year. Since January, the token has risen by almost 120%. This is almost double the gains of Bitcoin’s (BTC) near-60% growth in the same time frame. SOL’s growth is especially commendable given that it was one of the worst affected cryptos after the collapse of FTX in November 2022.

France Rumored To Be Adopting XRP For Digital Euro, How Will Price React?;"Despite its relatively low adoption in the US, XRP has continued to enjoy widespread adoption overseas in countries like Japan, Singapore, and others looking to incorporate cryptocurrencies into their economy. This time, France is rumored to be the latest country to have taken an interest in the token, per rumored reports.
Rumors have been circulating recently that France’s Central Bank, Banque de France, is considering adopting XRP for its digital euro, according to Edward Farina, a prominent figure in the community. However, there is yet to be any official announcement from the country’s foremost bank.
It is worth mentioning that the bank isn’t new to the blockchain and crypto space. Between 2020 and 2021, Banque de France ran a pilot test of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on a blockchain within the country’s debt market. As part of the experiment, participants traded securities and government bonds using CBDCs, which the bank supplied. 
In June 2021, the central bank explored the feasibility of using its CBDC for cross-border payments when it collaborated with the Swiss crypto-focused bank SEBA to test a CBDC for stimulating the settlement and transfer of listed security.
Meanwhile, the Central Bank highlighted the token’s potential in a research paper “Implementation of real-time settlement for banks using decentralised ledger technology: policy and legal implications” in 2016. The paper noted the difficulties experienced in facilitating cross-border payment transactions using the traditional correspondent banking network and how XRP could solve this problem. 
According to the bank, a token like XRP could be used as an intermediary asset to bridge any currency pair while using a decentralized ledger technology to facilitate these transactions – which is where Ripple’s on-demand liquidity and the XRPL come in. 
Such development represents what Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse was referring to when he stated that the token could become the next bitcoin if his company, Ripple, solves huge financial problems like this.

Despite some analysts predicting that the XRP price could further decline based on some technical analysis indicators, several fundamentals could potentially boost the token’s price. For one, XRP’s success seems to be majorly hinged on Ripple’s actions, and so far, the crypto company is undeniably forging ahead despite its legal battles. 
Furthermore, XRP has gone beyond being touted as a solution to a global financial problem to being implemented in the global financial structure. Banks in Asia are already adopting the token to process cross-border payments and massively contributing to the impressive trading volume that the token records on a daily basis. 
The token’s utility is bound to increase (especially in the US) as Ripple continues to land several blows to the SEC’s case against the crypto company. Ripple’s President Monica Lang had mentioned how Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling gave the company a much-needed boost to expand its services not just in the US but overseas. 
In such a case, the XRP price could see an increase as a result of the rising adoption. However, it still remains to be seen if there is any substance to the rumors.

Despite its relatively low adoption in the US, XRP has continued to enjoy widespread adoption overseas in countries like Japan, Singapore, and others looking to incorporate cryptocurrencies into their economy. This time, France is rumored to be the latest country to have taken an interest in the token, per rumored reports.
Rumors have been circulating recently that France’s Central Bank, Banque de France, is considering adopting XRP for its digital euro, according to Edward Farina, a prominent figure in the community. However, there is yet to be any official announcement from the country’s foremost bank.
It is worth mentioning that the bank isn’t new to the blockchain and crypto space.

As part of the experiment, participants traded securities and government bonds using CBDCs, which the bank supplied.

BNB Price Prediction – Bears Struggle, Will Price Finally Cross $220?;"BNB price is still consolidating above the $200 support zone against the US Dollar. It could start a decent increase if there is a close above the $220 resistance.
This past week, BNB price again retested the $200-$202 support zone. The bears made another attempt to clear the key $200 support, but they failed. A low was formed near $203 before the price started a decent increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
There was a move above the $210 and $212 levels. The price tested the main $220 resistance. A high is formed near $219.2 and the price is now consolidating above the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $203 swing low to the $220 high.
BNB is now trading above $210 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $211.5 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair.

If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $215.5 level. The next resistance sits near the $220 level. A clear move above the $220 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $235. A close above the $235 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance.
If BNB fails to clear the $220 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $211 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $207 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $203 swing low to the $220 high.
If there is a downside break below the $207 support, the price could drop toward the $202 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $185 level.
Technical Indicators
4-Hours MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone.
4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently above the 50 level.

Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals Might Elevate the Crypto Market by $1 Trillion: CryptoQuant;"The post Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals Might Elevate the Crypto Market by $1 Trillion: CryptoQuant appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
CryptoQuant, a leading on-chain data platform, has recently unveiled insights into the potential market implications of a Bitcoin spot ETF approval by the SEC. This anticipated move comes on the heels of legal victories by Ripple and Grayscale.
CryptoQuant’s analysis suggests that the capital poised to flow into spot ETFs could dwarf the inflows seen by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) during the last bull market cycle. To put things into perspective, GBTC, currently the world’s premier cryptocurrency fund, manages assets worth a staggering $16.7 billion. It’s worth noting that Grayscale and CoinDesk operate under the umbrella of the Digital Currency Group.
If the issuers who’ve applied for Bitcoin ETFs decide to invest merely 1% of their Assets Under Management (AUM) into these ETFs, a whopping $155 billion could flood the Bitcoin market. This figure represents about a third of Bitcoin’s present market value. Bitcoin’s price could soar to $50,000 to $73,000 if this prediction materializes.
In a significant milestone, the cryptocurrency market’s value surpassed the $1 trillion mark for the first time in January 2021. As of this report, Bitcoin dominates the scene, accounting for over half of the total $1.13 trillion market cap.
Delving deeper into the numbers, the collective assets managed by organizations vying for Bitcoin spot ETFs stand at a mind-boggling $15.6 trillion. If a mere 1% of this colossal sum finds its way into Bitcoin, BTC’s market value will witness a $155 billion surge. Such an influx could act as a catalyst, triggering a domino effect of further investments.
The market’s bullish sentiment was evident when a false rumor about approving a Spot Bitcoin ETF sent Bitcoin prices skyrocketing to $30,000. Many experts opine that this bullish momentum will deter bearish trends for the foreseeable future.
Marcus Thielen, a prominent figure at Matrixport, remarked, “Shortly, shorting BTC will be a move few will dare to make.” 
He further speculated that even if the ETF news turned out to be baseless, the upward trajectory of BTC would remain unaffected.
The Waiting Game with the SEC
While the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs seems inevitable, the timeline remains a topic of debate. CryptoQuant’s October forecast posited that an SEC nod could bolster Bitcoin’s market value by $150 billion initially, with potential subsequent investments pushing it up by another $900 billion.
CryptoQuant’s research indicates that financial institutions offering Bitcoin access via spot ETFs might herald the second wave of institutional adoption. This follows the initial wave witnessed in 2020-2021, where institutions began incorporating Bitcoin into their balance sheets.
Historical data reveals that Bitcoin’s market cap has amplified by 3-5 times its realized capitalization during bull phases. CryptoQuant’s projections suggest that for every fresh dollar invested in the Bitcoin market, the overall market cap could escalate by $3 to $5.

Asia proves to be a promising haven amid the crypto winter;"The crypto winter has had investors worried about their investments. However, Asia has solidified itself as a haven during this crypto winter. Compared to the US, Asia has had better reliance during this bearish period, and investors are confident that Asia is a considerable safe haven in the crypto winter season. 
The crypto world has always been highly volatile and wildly unpredictable. Considering the meteoric surge of Bitcoin, a lot of altcoins have emerged since its inception, others being resilient to the ups and downs of the crypto market. Currently,  the crypto market is experiencing a crypto winter. This implies the bearish sentiments and dwindling crypto prices since late last year. 
Asia has solidified itself as a unique crypto haven, considering a large number of countries in support of digital asset adoption. Among them are Hong Kong, China, and Singapore. An example is the crypto conference held in Singapore in September; and this attracted an unanticipated crowd of over 20,000 attendees, bringing together a large community of crypto and blockchain enthusiasts. 
These regions have played an important role in pivoting and shaping the cryptocurrency industry. 
Majorly, these regions have become familiar with crypto-friendly regulations and stay compliant with them in fostering innovation and development of crypto and blockchain technology. The regulatory clarity and strict implementation make Asia a uniquely suitable region for investors and assist in realizing the potential of blockchain tech. 
The United States, on the other hand, has been experiencing an ominous cloud of flurry of actions against cryptocurrencies brought by the government. The crypto titans affected include Ripple, Coinbase, Binance, and FTX, and the happenings around these firms have brought uncertainty in their underlying assets and the crypto universe at large. 
The Washington regulators blended with the Federal Reserve raising the federal fund rate has greatly impacted broader interest rates. 
According to Kevin Goldstein, senior advisor to HashKey Capital, one of Hong Kong’s leading crypto exchanges, the acts by the US regulators have had negative impacts on the crypto industry. He commented, “The resulting impact on broader interest rates has quite negatively impacted VC investment in the crypto ecosystem.”
Considering these negative implications, crypto projects have been seeking alternative paths to grow their portfolios. As such, crypto projects have been looking past the United States and looking into Asia as a digital asset safe haven. 
Asia is attributed to being a better option for crypto projects than the US based on the growing crypto adoption as well as policy development.  Following the legalization of retail cryptocurrency trading in the region of Hong Kong, new Web3 startups have been drawn to the region in hopes of tapping into the vast investor base in China, where crypto is banned. 
According to Paul Veradittakit, the managing partner at Pantera,  a crypto venture capital firm, Token2049 has had the best gathering of US crypto VCs ever seen in an Asian crypto event. 
He referred to Ripple’s acquisition of an approved license in Singapore that sought to offer payment services from its XRP tokens. In his words, Veradittakit started:
 Things have changed quite a bit since FTX where there’s been a little bit more scrutiny around regulations in the U.S., while there have been some positive developments (in Asia) around stablecoins, XRP, or ETF possibilities.
Among the US crypto gurus that have shifted to Asia or are in plans to do so include Coinbase, Gemini, Paxos, CMT Digital, and Galaxy. Investors are seeking to grasp the crucial market opportunities in the geographically diverse region of Asia. 
Moreover, regions like South Korea have had success in crypto adoption, considering their tokenomics incorporation into the fan economy. Japan, too, has a wealth of gaming intellectual products that are ready for NFT incorporation. 
Hong Kong also has prominent financial hubs that spearhead the regulatory endeavor for crypto financial institutions.

Realistic BTC Prediction, Massive XRP Price Targets, SHIB Milestones: Bits Recap Oct 19;"TL;DR

Despite significantly improving its price performance in 2023 (compared to the second half of 2022), the valuation of the primary cryptocurrency is still far away from the levels envisioned by some analysts.
Finance experts like Robert Kiyosaki (the author of the best-seller Rich Dad, Poor Dad), Adam Back (CEO of Blockstream), and Tom Lee (Managing Partner at Fundstrat) have previously forecasted that it could surpass the $100K coveted level in the future, while the perma-bull Michael Saylor set a price tag of a whopping $1 million.
The most recent prediction came from the X (Twitter) user CryptoCon, who believes the asset has the potential to skyrocket to approximately $138,000 by the end of 2025. The surge could become a reality only if BTC overcomes certain resistance levels and gets a serious boost from the upcoming halving (scheduled for the spring of next year), the analyst assumed.
Ripple’s native token – XRP – has also been in the spotlight lately, with numerous individuals forecasting a potential bull run. The popular X user EGRAG CRYPTO said earlier this week that the asset might reach the somewhat absurd $27 by Q4 2025. 
The analyst based his most recent research on the “Elliott Wave Theory,” which has five progressive stages. The third phase is considered a “game-changer” and could propel a rapid increase. 
“Wave 3 emerges as the trend’s dominant force, eclipsing other waves in size and influence. Wave 3 often extends Wave 1 by a ratio of approximately 1.618, painting a promising picture for XRP’s future,” they explained.
However, EGRAG CRYPTO reminded that XRP is still in the first stage, called Wave 1.
Subsequently, the popular memecoin Shiba Inu, specifically its layer-2 blockchain solution Shibarium, recorded another achievement. The network’s total number of transactions surpassed 3.5 million, whereas total blocks have exceeded 1.2 million.
Shibarium saw the light of day less than two months ago but keeps smashing milestones. It aims to elevate Shiba Inu (SHIB) above its rivals in the memecoin realm by lowering transaction costs and improving speed. Those willing to learn more on the matter can check the video below:

Uniswap To Begin Charging 0.15% Swap Fees;"Uniswap, a core decentralized exchange (DEXs) operating in the crypto space, is set to introduce a 0.15% swap fee for certain tokens within its web application and wallet starting today October 17 (GMT), marking a shift from the platform's previous no-fee structure.
According to Uniswap, the tokens affected by this fee adjustment include Ethereum (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), Wrapped Ether (WETH), Tether (USDT), DAI, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Angle Protocol (agEUR), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), Liquidity USD (LUSD), Euro Coin (EUROC), and StraitsX (XSGD). 
However, just two days prior to this development, controversy emerged surrounding an open-source directory for Uniswap V4, which introduced a hook capable of requiring know-your-customer (KYC) verification before participating in the DEX's liquidity pools. It's also important to note that the aforementioned fees will only be applicable if both the input and output tokens are on the list.
Uniswap's founder, Hayden Adams, shared his thoughts on and why the urgent update, claiming that the interface fee for swapping (for 0.15%) is among the lowest in the industry. Adams says that the fee collected will be deducted from the output token amount. Notably, there won't be any fees imposed on swaps between Ether and Wrapped Ether trading pairs, as well as inter-stablecoin swaps.
I work in crypto because of the immense positive impact I believe it can have on the world, removing gatekeepers and increasing access to value and ownership.I’m proud of the ways @Uniswap Labs has contributed to that effort and want to make sure we’re creating sustainable…

Adams says that the fee is critical in sustaining Uniswap's ongoing research, development, and expansion efforts in the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The founder also mentioned several key initiatives in the Uniswap ecosystem, including the upcoming iOS wallet, Android wallet, UniswapX, substantial improvements to their web application, Permit2, Uniswap v4 draft codebase, and other initiatives in the platform's pipeline.
As one of the premier DEXs, Uniswap represents a substantial presence in the industry. Public blockchain data reveals that the platform currently holds a total value of $3 billion, with an annualized protocol fee revenue exceeding $271 million. On top of this, Uniswap also maintains a treasury of $12 million and has secured $176 million in investments since its inception in 2018.

Uniswap, a core decentralized exchange (DEXs) operating in the crypto space, is set to introduce a 0.15% swap fee for certain tokens within its web application and wallet starting today October 17 (GMT), marking a shift from the platform's previous no-fee structure.
According to Uniswap, the tokens affected by this fee adjustment include Ethereum (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), Wrapped Ether (WETH), Tether (USDT), DAI, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Angle Protocol (agEUR), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), Liquidity USD (LUSD), Euro Coin (EUROC), and StraitsX (XSGD). 
However, just two days prior to this development, controversy emerged surrounding an open-source directory for Uniswap V4, which introduced a hook capable of requiring know-your-customer (KYC) verification before participating in the DEX's liquidity pools. It's also important to note that the aforementioned fees will only be applicable if both the input and output tokens are on the list.

Ethereum Underperforms Bitcoin, Bulls Struggle To Protect Key Support;"Ethereum price failed to start fresh increase above $1,600 against the US dollar. ETH is now struggling to stay above the $1,550 support zone.
Ethereum struggled to settle above $1,650 and started a fresh decline. ETH traded below the $1,620 and $1,600 support levels. There was a short consolidation phase before the price extended its decline, unlike Bitcoin.
There was a move below the $1,575 support and the price tested $1,550. A low is formed near $1,553 and the price is now consolidating losses. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,570 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.
Ethereum is now trading just below $1,580 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,570 level and the trend line. The 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,553 low is also just above the trend line.
The first major resistance is near the $1,600 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,553 low.

Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com
A close above the $1,600 resistance might start a decent increase. In the stated case, Ether could rise and recover toward the $1,660 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,720.
If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,570 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,550 level.
The next key support is $1,520. A downside break below the $1,520 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,480 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,420 level.
Technical Indicators
Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.
Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.
Major Support Level – $1,550
Major Resistance Level – $1,570

Why Strategic Money Will Enter Crypto Despite The Slowdown: Mysten Labs CEO;"In a recent interview with The Block, Evan Cheng, CEO of Mysten Labs, shared his insights on the shifting dynamics of the crypto investment landscape. 
Cheng, who co-founded Mysten Labs, the creator of the innovative Layer 1 blockchain Sui, believes that the recent slowdown in crypto investments following the hype-driven bull run will soon give way to a more strategic and cautious approach.
Cheng expressed optimism about the growing interest of traditional financial institutions in the crypto and blockchain space. He envisions a more mature and merit-based environment emerging as a result of this interest. 
He revealed ongoing conversations with investors in the Gulf region, such as the UAE and Qatar, and noted a strong desire among them to position themselves strategically in the crypto market. 
Similar sentiments are echoing across the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, where there is a surge of interest in crypto investments.
Cheng emphasized that while money is expected to flow back into the digital currency market, investors will approach it with a much higher degree of caution and strategy. The days of the frenzied bull run are giving way to a more measured and thoughtful investment landscape. 
With the crypto market maturing, investors are becoming discerning in their choices, focusing on projects and technologies that hold long-term promise.
Mysten Labs is known for its groundbreaking Layer 1 blockchain, Sui, which leverages the Move programming language. This language was first developed at Meta, where Cheng had previously worked. Cheng’s extensive experience, which includes over a decade at Apple, has given him a unique perspective on the convergence of traditional finance and the crypto space.
Markus Levin, the co-founder of XYO Network, also shared his insights on the evolving crypto landscape. Levin believes that the approval of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) would be a game-changer for Bitcoin adoption, particularly among institutional investors.

Levin pointed out that the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price, triggered by a false report of a BTC spot ETF approval, highlights the immense anticipation among institutional investors. He firmly believes that once an ETF receives regulatory approval, a massive influx of capital will flood into the market, leading to a significant rally in Bitcoin’s price. 
While Levin speculated that this green light might come early next year, he underscored that it is only a matter of time before a Bitcoin ETF becomes a reality.
The past year has been challenging for crypto startups, with venture investment in the sector significantly declining. In August, less than $500 million was invested, marking the lowest level in more than two years. This decline underscores the cautious approach of investors and the need for startups to demonstrate real value and innovation to secure funding.
The awaited approval of a BTC ETF promises to reshape the crypto market, drawing in institutional investors and driving further adoption. For crypto startups, this changing landscape presents both challenges and opportunities, as they must adapt to meet the new demands of the market.

Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Higher, as SEC’s Gensler Says Around 10 ETFs Are Being Reviewed;"Bitcoin edged slightly higher on Thursday, following comments from the Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler. Gensler said the commission was currently reviewing eight to ten applications from firms looking to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded-fund (ETF).
Bitcoin snapped a two-day losing streak on Thursday, as markets reacted to comments on spot bitcoin ETFs from SEC Chair Gensler.
BTC/USD peaked at $28,566.75 on the news, following a low of $28,174.25 during Wednesday’s session.
Today’s move comes as bitcoin bulls pushed price back above a recent floor at the $28,200 level.
Looking at the chart, the bounce comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) jumped at a support point of its own at 63.00.
Currently, the index is tracking at 64.35, which is marginally below the next point of resistance at 65.00.
In order for bullish momentum to intensify, this ceiling will first need to be broken in the coming hours or days.
Ethereum (ETH) on the other hand, fell for a third straight session, as the cryptocurrency collided with a long-term floor.
After hitting a high at $1,580.26 on Wednesday, ETH/USD plunged to an intraday low of $1,543.59 earlier today.
The move saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency close in on a support point at the $1,540 mark.
This comes as the 10-day (red) moving average continued to trend lower, and extend its downward cross with the 25-day (blue) trend line.
The last time bears forced a breakout below the aforementioned floor, ethereum went on to fall to a seven-month low.

XRP Price Decline: Is Ripple Selling Off Tokens?;"After surging above the $0.51 mark on Monday, the XRP price has been on a decline once more. This has seen the asset drop back below $0.49 as obvious selling pressure continues to mount on the altcoin. The major focus of holders has been on where this sell pressure is coming from and a number of large transfers from Ripple have raised eyebrows.
On Monday, two transactions from Ripple caught the attention of the XRP community. The transactions which were detected by whale tracking platform Whale Alert were carrying a significant amount of XRP tokens, leading to speculations that the crypto firm is selling part of its holdings.
The first transaction which was carrying 75 million tokens worth $36.92 million was being sent to an unknown wallet. In this case, it is likely that this tranche of tokens was being sent to a private owner, probably in an over-the-counter (OTC) deal.
  75,000,000 #XRP (36,921,543 USD) transferred from #Ripple to unknown wallethttps://t.co/VRawsYdrhI
— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 16, 2023

The next transaction raised further concerns in the community due to its destination. This time around, Ripple had sent 30 million tokens worth approximately $14.95 million at the time to the Bistamp crypto exchange.  Since the main reason crypto users tend to send tokens to exchanges is so they can sell, this raised more eyebrows, causing speculations that Ripple is selling.
 30,000,000 #XRP (14,949,851 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Bitstamphttps://t.co/glt1BJqnZY
— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 16, 2023

One thing to note is that large transfers often take place between Ripple and the Bitstamp exchange. This is because Bitstamp is one of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services, which explains a lot of the large transactions happening between the two.
However, there is a lot of sell pressure on the XRP price causing it to fall and struggle in the market. Amid this, there has also been a decline in trading interest as evidenced by the almost 26% drop in its daily trading volume between Tuesday and Wednesday, and a 0.33% drop in its market cap in the same time period.
The XRP price remains highly correlated with the general crypto market which explains its drop over the last day as the bulls have slowed down considerably. If the Bitcoin price starts to rally again, then it is likely XRP will follow, leading to a possible break of $0.5 once more.
Presently, the XRP price is sitting at $0.4881 after dropping 0.91% in the last day, but up 0.89% on the 7-day chart, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Nevertheless, the altcoin’s $26 billion market cap makes it the sixth-largest cryptocurrency in the market.

Gemini, Genesis and DCG Lied to Investors and Tried to Hide $1,000,000,000 in Crypto Losses, Alleges New York AG;"New York State Attorney General (AG) Letitia James is suing three large crypto firms for allegedly defrauding over 230,000 Americans.
In a new press release, AG Letitia James says that she is taking legal action against the crypto exchange Gemini, the lending firm Genesis and the investment giant Digital Currency Group (DCG) over allegations that the companies attempted to conceal $1.1 billion in losses and “repeatedly lied” to its investors.
An investigation found that Gemini lied to investors about the risks of its Gemini Earn program, which aimed to provide customers with yield on their crypto assets. Gemini partnered with Genesis to facilitate the service.
James also alleges that at one point, Genesis’ loans were “undersecured” and on one occasion concentrated within Alameda Research, the trading arm of now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and under control by its disgraced CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
The lawsuit also directs charges at former Genesis CEO Soichiro Moro and DCG CEO Barry Silbert.
AG James says the lawsuit also seeks to ban all three firms from the financial investment industry of New York. and requests compensation for investors’ losses and disgorgement of the companies’ “ill-gotten gains.”
Says the New York State Attorney General,
“These cryptocurrency companies lied to investors and tried to hide more than a billion dollars in losses, and it was middle-class investors who suffered as a result…
Hardworking New Yorkers and investors around the country lost more than a billion dollars because they were fed blatant lies that their money would be safe and grow if they invested it in Gemini Earn. Instead, Gemini hid the risks of investing with Genesis and Genesis lied to the public about its losses. This fraud is yet another example of bad actors causing harm throughout the under-regulated cryptocurrency industry. My office will continue our efforts to stop deceptive cryptocurrency companies and push for stronger regulations to protect all investors.”
Genesis went bankrupt early this year and owed $735 million to members of the Earn program during its collapse.
Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss alleged that DCG, Silbert, other executives, and Genesis created false financial reports in order to trick their creditors and maintain the illusion that everything was in order.

Real Reason Behind Ethereum Founder’s Massive ETH ‘Sales’ Exposed;"A crypto wallet owned by the Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has seen a series of transactional activities lately, piquing the interest of crypto community members at a time when Ethereum selling pressures are rising. 
Following this, Buterin has taken the initiative to address the concerns regarding his recent transfer of digital assets to multiple exchanges. 
In a recent post on Warp Cast, a decentralized social network, Russian-Canadian computer programmer and founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin publicized the real reason behind the latest ETH transfers made via his wallet address. 
Buterin explained to the public that the large-scale ETH transactions that were performed using his wallet were not sold by him. He stated that over the years, he has mostly focused on donating large sums of Ethereum funds to charity organizations and other projects. He further solidified his claims saying that he had not sold ETH for personal profits since 2018. 
“If you see an article saying ‘Vitalik sends XXX ETH to [exchange]’, it’s not actually me selling, it’s almost always me donating to some charity or nonprofit or other projects, and the recipient selling because, well, they have to cover expenses,” Buterin stated. 
Buterin is well-known for his philanthropic acts toward charity organizations and medical interventions. The Ethereum co-founder made headlines in 2021, after donating $1 billion worth of SHIB tokens to a COVID-19 relief fund in India. 
Additionally, in February 2023, Buterin donated $150,000 to Anka Relief to fund a crypto aid project that would support Türkiye after its recent earthquake experiences.
Although there have been many proofs of Buterin’s propensity to donate to multiple charities, the crypto community has remained skeptical and vigilant, relentlessly monitoring the Ethereum founder’s cryptocurrency activities, as well as these recent high-value ETH transactions. 

According to data from PeckShield Alert, a blockchain security and auditing firm, Vitalik Buterin recently made a large-scale transaction of $15 million USDC to the Gemini Exchange. 
This transaction in question is among the list of recent transfers associated with the Ethereum founder. These movements have prompted both curiosity and concern in the crypto community, as observers attempt to determine the underlying motive behind Buterin’s transactions.
A report from Cointelegraph said an Ethereum Foundation Spokesperson has clarified the details behind the lofty transaction. According to the Spokesperson, the $15 million USDC transfer was only executed under Buterin’s Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and not from his wallet address. 
The spokesperson also supposedly confirmed that the funds were from a transfer made by a charity multi-sig wallet, Kanro, which is closely linked to Buterin to sponsor a grant.

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network powers innovative publisher monetization tools by Mash and TFTC;"Media monetization platform Mash and publishing firm TFTC have joined forces to introduce innovative publisher monetization tools powered by Bitcoin’s (BTC) Lightning Network (LN), according to an Oct. 17 statement shared with CryptoSlate.
These collaborative products encompass monetization, growth, and engagement solutions for publishers. Their primary goal is to address challenges related to monetizing publishing endeavors and to boost user engagement beyond the typical comment sections.
As a result, the platforms have unveiled “Reactions,” enabling users to engage with publisher content and prolong their time on the sites. Notably, this feature offers free and paid options, thanks to micro-payments facilitated by the Lightning Network.
Jared Nusinoff, CEO of Mash, said the Reaction can enhance user experiences and bring a multiplayer dynamic to the platform.
Marty Bent, CEO of TFTC, shared similar views, saying the feature empowers users to engage and directly interact with the community.
In line with this partnership, both platforms have undergone a comprehensive redesign to accommodate the new products and harness the capabilities of Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.
The LN is the most popular “layer 2” payment protocol built on Bitcoin. This solution facilitates quicker and more cost-effective transactions among network nodes. Its primary goal is to address the scalability challenges faced by BTC, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction and potentially spurring increased usage of the blockchain network.
Mash has introduced an engagement hub for voting, donations, and more, including meme integration. This technology leverages the Lightning Network infrastructure, ensuring seamless payments and rewards.
Nusinoff said:
“The interoperability provided by the lightning network and the benefits from corresponding network effects are a large unlocking factor. And the more publishers that sign-on, the more we all win. And it’s something that’s only possible with bitcoin, digitally native money”
Meanwhile, the platform plans to introduce a revenue-sharing model, benefiting site owners, creators, contributors, and staff in the future.
On the other hand, TFTC has expanded its scope beyond Bitcoin, incorporating more diverse topics. The platform now features exclusive content from notable figures such as Robert Bryce, Parker Lewis, Jordan Schachtel, and Whitney Webb.
Bent explained that the expansion was necessitated by the demand for high-quality content beyond Bitcoin from their audience.

Ethereum Staking Rewards Plunge To New Lows: Is It Still Worth It To Stake Your ETH?;"One of the greatest pulls toward Ethereum staking over the years has been the mouthwatering APY. Stakers were being rewarded handsomely for committing their ETH tokens to help secure the network, prompting a rapid rise in the percentage of ETH supply staked. However, there has been a sharp decline in the APY which has raised the question of whether it is still worth it to stake ETH.
In an interesting turn of events, the yearly APY that is being paid to Ethereum stakers has dropped to 3.5%. This was the case on the last reward day which took place on Sunday, October 15, and as the BeaconChain website points out, stakers are now receiving 3.502% rewards per annum.
This is a far cry from the 18% per annum that was recorded back in 2020 when the Ethereum staking first began. Since then, there has been somewhat of a constant decline in the yearly rewards being paid to stakers, although there have been points where the rewards have surged.

For example, on the May 5, 2023 reward day, staking rewards were sitting at 8.617% per annum with 4,229 ETH paid out to stakers. However, the yearly rewards have had no success in reaching this level again with declines being the order of the day.
The Sunday figures represent an almost 60% drop from its May figures. On a much shorter timeframe, the ETH staking rewards are down 10% in October alone, after starting out the month with a yearly APY of 3.89%. Additionally, total staking rewards for Sunday came out to 2,645 ETH, compared to 2,855 ETH at the start of the month.
Staking ETH to become a validator on the Ethereum network does not require high-computational machines like Bitcoin. As such, the overhead costs to actually become a validator on the network is little to none, especially with liquid staking protocols making it much easier for users.
So despite the diminished APY, it is still profitable to stake ETH. This is because users are able to earn extra ETH on top of their staked ETH which they are now able to withdraw when they need. Also, even at a 3.5% APY, it is still higher than the baseline interest for most banks around the world.
However, there is also the fact that the price of ETH might fall while a user has their ETH staked, which should be something to think about before staking. This drop could mean the ETH may be worth less than they did when they went in. One instance of this is those who staked their coins in 2021 when the price of ETH was above $4,000. By withdrawing and selling now, they would be selling at a loss, even when the yearly APY is factored in.

Timeout Trees: A Solution To Scaling Lightning Network LSPs;"One of the biggest inherent limitations to the Lightning Network is the limited number of channels that can be opened or closed per block given the blocksize limit. Regardless of how many transactions can occur off-chain how cheaply, this is a fundamental bottleneck restricting how many people could actually realistically use the Lightning Network. Even the Lightning Network whitepaper went through in the conclusion that in a scenario where the entire world's population of 7 billion was using Lightning, with only two on-chain transactions a year per person, Bitcoin would require 133 MB blocks for Lightning to work. This isn't some out of left field problem, or unpredictable issue, it was a limitation of the protocol design fully understood from day one. 
Part of the plan to address this issue has always been the idea of channel factories, i.e. a type of channel that more than two users participated in. This was always the direction things would have to go in order to scale Lightning and Bitcoin without a blocksize increase, but the issue is that solving the problem of on-chain footprints introduces a whole host of other problems. First of all, nothing fundamental changes about the requirement to enforce intermediate states if a counterparty becomes non-responsive. This has implications for the value-add. The entire point of a channel factory is that, for example, twenty people can share one UTXO and rearrange the liquidity inside with the other twenty people however they want. Once someone closes out on-chain non-cooperatively this starts to interfere with that goal. 
If I close out my channel inside a channel factory, I drag a bunch of people with me out of the factory. Think of a factory like a merkle tree, there's one UTXO at the top, and that splits in half off-chain, and those split in half, etc. until we get to everyone's individual channels. Once I peel my channel out of the factory, everyone on my side of each split that goes on-chain is now cut off from everyone else in the factory. They can no longer reorganize their liquidity into that part of the group if everyone cooperates. 
Another big issue is that even to start one you need to have everyone online at the beginning to pre-sign all the transactions. If you want twenty people in a factory, everyone needs to be online to start it. If you want a thousand people, a thousand people need to be online, etc. 
This makes channel factories a big design space full of lots of problems to solve. So we solve an existing problem for Lightning, but make a bunch of new ones. Sounds like engineering to me. 
Timeout Trees
John Law's recent proposal, Timeout Trees, attempts to offer a solution to the one core issue of channel factories. I wouldn't quite call a timeout tree a channel factory, more of a ""proto-factory,"" but it offers a potential solution to the issue of opening and closing massive amounts of channels without introducing the problem of non-cooperative closes ruining the use of the factory for other users. It requires CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV) and a Lighting Service Provider (LSP) in order to work functionally. 
A Timeout Tree is essentially a channel factory guaranteed by covenants, with no ability to change how the liquidity is reorganized off-chain after it is made, with a special escape clause. An LSP, we'll call them Bob, plays the role of bridging casual users into the wider Lightning Network. Bob can take coins he controls and create a CTV tree that creates a single UTXO unfurling to open channels to any arbitrary number of users of his LSP service. The nice thing about CTV is it enables this to be done without everyone being online at the same time. Bob can simply get everyone to sign their initial channel state one at a time and hold onto them until everyone has set up the channel, and just spend the funds into the CTV tree when he has channels set up with every user. 
This addresses the problem of everyone having to be online at the same time in order to set up the ""factory"" and start using Lightning. Because of CTV, once Bob spends coins into the tree setting up everyone's Lightning channels, there is no way for him to back out and take the coins (yet). With that first UTXO in the CTV confirmed on-chain, everyone can treat their channels as open and there is no risk of them being doublespent. 
Now the last part, closing the channels. Even though opening them only requires a single UTXO on-chain because of CTV, closing them still would require the entire CTV tree to unfurl on-chain so everyone can submit their channel states, right? Wrong. This is the Timeout part of Timeout Trees. Every branch in the Timeout Tree has a script branch where Bob can sweep all of the funds after a timelock. 
Now I'm sure you're thinking ""what!?"" This is the real genius of how this proposal works. Because Bob can sweep the on-chain UTXOs himself without anyone else after the timelock, these channels all have an expiration date unless users actually unfurl the whole tree and confirm the real channel funding on-chain. This allows Bob to do something neat: when that timelock is coming up, he can open a brand new Timeout Tree with all the users of the current one, and have them move all of their funds from the expiring tree into the new one entirely off-chain on Lightning and then sweep the single on-chain UTXO of the last tree. 
This allows for efficient closing of all these channels on-chain. The only problem left now is enforcing an HTLC on-chain if the other party stops cooperating. Well…that isn't really an issue in this case, or rather it's an all or nothing issue. The reason channels have to be closed to enforce an HTLC is if the other party of the channel stops responding in the middle of routing it. In a Timeout Tree every single user's counterpart is Bob. So if Bob, as long as he is being honest, is not responding to update a failed or successful HTLC for one user, he's not responding for any other user either. In that case everyone can still close out their channels on-chain before the timeout and stop using Bob's LSP. 
Wrapping Up 
Users will still have to pay fees for on-chain interactions, there is no way around that, and an entire Timeout Tree closing out on-chain non-cooperatively would be a large and expensive on-chain footprint, but this is ultimately an issue any multiparty channel system will have to address. Timeout Trees however does have compelling solutions to the cooperative case of both opening and closing a massive multiparty channel without degrading the trust model of the system to something custodial. 
John has even in his most recent version of the paper proposed a scheme where users could be penalized for non-cooperative closures enough to cover Bob's cost for eventually sweeping a bunch of fragmented tree UTXOs after the timeout. Potentially there are ways to do the reverse if Bob's inactivity or dishonesty is the cause for users having to non-cooperatively close their part of the tree. 
At the end of the day though, this is a very concrete and specific proposal for a channel factory design that actually attempts to address the real issues of use and implementation instead of a half-defined and vague concept. That is massive progress in terms of addressing Lightning's long-term scaling limitations.

Now I'm sure you're thinking ""what!?"" This is the real genius of how this proposal works. Because Bob can sweep the on-chain UTXOs himself without anyone else after the timelock, these channels all have an expiration date unless users actually unfurl the whole tree and confirm the real channel funding on-chain. This allows Bob to do something neat: when that timelock is coming up, he can open a brand new Timeout Tree with all the users of the current one, and have them move all of their funds from the expiring tree into the new one entirely off-chain on Lightning and then sweep the single on-chain UTXO of the last tree. 
This allows for efficient closing of all these channels on-chain. The only problem left now is enforcing an HTLC on-chain if the other party stops cooperating. Well…that isn't really an issue in this case, or rather it's an all or nothing issue. The reason channels have to be closed to enforce an HTLC is if the other party of the channel stops responding in the middle of routing it. In a Timeout Tree every single user's counterpart is Bob. So if Bob, as long as he is being honest, is not responding to update a failed or successful HTLC for one user, he's not responding for any other user either. In that case everyone can still close out their channels on-chain before the timeout and stop using Bob's LSP. 
Wrapping Up 
Users will still have to pay fees for on-chain interactions, there is no way around that, and an entire Timeout Tree closing out on-chain non-cooperatively would be a large and expensive on-chain footprint, but this is ultimately an issue any multiparty channel system will have to address. Timeout Trees however does have compelling solutions to the cooperative case of both opening and closing a massive multiparty channel without degrading the trust model of the system to something custodial. 
John has even in his most recent version of the paper proposed a scheme where users could be penalized for non-cooperative closures enough to cover Bob's cost for eventually sweeping a bunch of fragmented tree UTXOs after the timeout. Potentially there are ways to do the reverse if Bob's inactivity or dishonesty is the cause for users having to non-cooperatively close their part of the tree. 
At the end of the day though, this is a very concrete and specific proposal for a channel factory design that actually attempts to address the real issues of use and implementation instead of a half-defined and vague concept. That is massive progress in terms of addressing Lightning's long-term scaling limitations.

Fake BlackRock ETF news wipes $65m in BTC;"The volatile crypto market’s susceptibility to rumors and false information was on full display recently when a counterfeit report concerning BlackRock’s purported approval for a Bitcoin ETF wreaked havoc. 
Misinformation isn’t new to the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, but when it leads to a staggering loss of over $65 million within moments, it certainly demands a scrutinizing gaze.
As word spread like wildfire across various digital platforms that the SEC had given the thumbs up to a spot Bitcoin ETF product from BlackRock, a frantic buying spree was ignited. 
Bitcoin prices surged from a steady $27,900 to the dizzying heights of almost $30,000, fueled by the exhilarating – albeit misleading – news.
However, in the cutthroat world of crypto trading, what goes up often comes down just as swiftly. As more discerning eyes delved into the claim’s legitimacy, it became glaringly obvious that the reports were baseless. 
The aftermath was a brutal reality check: Bitcoin’s value plummeted back to around $28,000. As a result, those traders, whose hopes had skyrocketed and wallets had opened wide at the peak, faced the brutal whiplash of being liquidated, unable to foot the bill of their margin requirements.
Drawing on the data provided by Coinglass, the aftershock of this short-lived crypto rally reversal resulted in a jaw-dropping total liquidation of $71.36 million. 
As the dust began to settle, the staggering financial fallout from the false BlackRock news was pegged at an eye-watering $114.7 million.
Lookonchain’s numbers painted a bleak picture of the frenzied buying and selling during this period. One particularly painful anecdote involves an ambitious whale who splurged on a whopping 20.5 WBTC, parting with 613,201 USDC. 
Yet, within a mere ten minutes, this grand venture was sold off at a heart-wrenching loss of $49k. Such instances underscore the gravity of decisions made in haste and the perils of letting Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) dictate trading choices.
In an ecosystem where fortunes can be made or lost on the strength of a tweet or an unfounded rumor, traders must tread with caution. 
Yes, the allure of the crypto market is undeniable, and the potential SEC nod for a Bitcoin ETF by giants like BlackRock is a tantalizing prospect. But jumping the gun based on unreliable evidence can spell disaster.
The bottomline while the crypto market’s allure remains potent and the promise of lucrative returns is hard to resist, traders must be armored with verified information and a healthy dose of skepticism. 
Reacting impulsively to every ripple in the vast ocean of crypto news can lead to dire consequences. 
And when even giants like BlackRock can inadvertently find themselves at the center of a stormy controversy, one must question the reliability of every byte of information before making that decisive click to trade.

Loom Network Price Tanks Over 70% in Four Days But Could This New Crypto Have Higher Potential?;"The crypto market has been highly volatile recently, with most coins and tokens seeing substantial price swings.
Loom Network (LOOM) has been the latest crypto to experience this volatility, plummeting from its peak on Sunday.
However, the market’s swings have opened up opportunities for newly launched cryptos to make their mark – with Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) emerging as a project being touted for exponential growth.
At the time of writing, LOOM is trading around the $0.114 level – a 77% drop in less than four days.
Prior to this drop, LOOM had been on an extended uptrend, rising from just $0.042 in September to a high of $0.499, representing a 1,063% surge.
This rise led to LOOM being ranked on CoinMarketCap’s list of trending cryptocurrencies, yet the token’s time in the limelight appears to have been short-lived.

Since peaking on Sunday morning, LOOM’s price has capitulated dramatically, reinforcing the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.
Adding more pain for LOOM holders is that the price breezed through both the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) to the downside on the 4-hour chart, indicating that the trend has definitively shifted.
With no clear areas of support in sight, LOOM could likely continue to face downside risk in the near term.
Loom Network’s sharp decline can be attributed to several factors that have shaken investor confidence.
A tweet from Lookonchain disclosed that a wallet holding over 47% of LOOM’s supply has started offloading tokens, sparking fears of potential price manipulation.
This significant sell-off overwhelmed buying demand, causing the token’s price to collapse.

Speculation is rife that this whale wallet may belong to an exchange like Upbit, engaging in questionable tactics to profit from LOOM’s prior pump.
Moreover, developer activity around Loom Network is down significantly from its peak, raising doubts about the project’s team and resources.
Unsurprisingly, this lack of new features and partnerships has made holders question LOOM’s long-term viability as an investment.
Ultimately, the initial hype around Loom Network has faded, with profit-taking in full swing and investor sentiment shifting negative.
With Loom Network’s outlook murky amid its dramatic sell-off, crypto investors are shifting their focus to emerging projects with more upside potential.
One such new opportunity is Bitcoin Minetrix, an Ethereum-based platform aiming to transform crypto-mining accessibility.
Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) operates via a “Stake-to-Mine” model that tokenizes the crypto-mining process.
Holders earn mining credits by staking their BTCMTX tokens, which are burned to gain cloud mining power.
This allows everyday crypto enthusiasts to mine BTC and earn recurring rewards without the need for expensive hardware or risky contracts.

Additionally, Bitcoin Minetrix features a staking protocol for BTCMTX that offers rewards of 332% APY for token holders.
With a seasoned team and planned partnerships with leading cloud mining providers, Bitcoin Minetrix looks well-positioned within the growing crypto-mining sector.
Additionally, with the next Bitcoin halving fast approaching, the platform is being touted as a way for users to benefit from any increases in the BTC price and mining yields.
The project has now begun to pick up steam on social media, with over 2,400 people taking part in the official Bitcoin Minetrix Telegram channel.

Although the Bitcoin Minetrix platform is still in development, would-be investors can buy BTCMTX tokens before its release for $0.0111 through the ongoing presale.
This presale will have ten stages, each with a gradually increasing BTCMTX price, meaning those who invest the earliest are rewarded with a lower entry point.
Having already raised over $1.7 million, Bitcoin Minetrix offers an intriguing alternative to Loom Network – and could be the next major mining disruptor to enter the market.

Ava Labs President John Wu Makes 2024 Crypto Predictions, Says Big Developments Coming for Avalanche Ecosystem;"The president of the Avalanche (AVAX) development firm Ava Labs is issuing his crypto predictions for 2024.
In the interview with CNBC, Ava Labs president John Wu talks up the Friend.tech challenger Stars Arena, a decentralized social finance application (SocialFi) that launched on the AVAX blockchain in late September.
“We just talked about Stars Arena, and they’re going back online, and we will see one of these SocialFi DApps figure it out. There’s been a couple already, and they’ve had booms and some busts, but sooner or later they’re fixing the business model and it will work well. So that’s one of my predictions.”
Wu also predicts the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF), potentially even in the fourth quarter of 2023.
“When that happens, I anticipate a lot of inflow.” 
The SEC delayed decisions on a slew of spot BTC ETF applications, including BlackRock’s, in late September.
The final deadline for the SEC to review one application, the ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF, is on January 10th.
In terms of updates to Avalanche, Wu notes that Ava Labs plans to roll out real-world assets, some of which will be announced in November.
“These are, I think, game-changing developments with… TradFi banks and asset managers. These announcements will be really big, I’m super excited for these institutional, real-world assets being deployed on Avalanche.” 
Avalanche is an Ethereum (ETH) rival. The project’s native asset, AVAX, is trading at $8.93 at time of writing.

Is Ethereum Price Turing Out To Be A Red Flag For Investors? What’s Next For ETH Price?;"The post Is Ethereum Price Turing Out To Be A Red Flag For Investors? What’s Next For ETH Price? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
As the market witnessed the third consecutive green trading day the industry takes steps toward stability. Bitcoin price has gained over 2.5% in value in the past day, but on the other hand, Ethereum coin has failed to follow the footsteps of the market leader and gain momentum as the coin has only displayed a 0.15% gain in its value.
The ETH coin was struggling close to its support zone at $1,600 for September, but as the month ended, the Ethereum price gained momentum, resulting in breaking out of multiple resistance levels. The price was rejected at $1,750, after which the coin lost speed and started trading negatively.
The Ethereum coin price broke down its critical support level of $1,600 and continued to dip and test its crucial support level of $1,539.01. After this, the ETH price started trading in a symmetric triangle. The price is also hovering close to its important resistance zone of $1,600.53 and is expected to break it soon, of which the result is uncertain.
The RSI displayed a significant price movement and is presently trading above the mid-point, indicating a massive buying and selling power for the coin. Further, the averages show a possibility of a bearish convergence in the chart, suggesting a case of a trend reversal in the coming time.
Altcoin Sherpa, a well-known crypto analyst with a substantial following of 196.8K+ on the X platform, predicts that the Altcoins and ETH price will experience a rebound soon.
$ETH: Time to scale into altcoins is probably now for #Ethereum…I don't know when this will outperform btc but I do think that it should bounce soon.Price could still grind down to .05 but now is when you should pay attention IMO…$ETHBTC pic.twitter.com/UEokV6xZaC
Further, he expects the Ethereum price to undergo a minor dip in the coming time, after which the price will gain significant traction and, in the upcoming bull run, outperform other cryptos to claim the best performer title.
The analyst thinks this to be the most appropriate time to invest in Ethereum and start scaling into altcoins, as ETH may someday outperform the market leader, Bitcoin.
The ETH bulls are struggling to hold their price above the critical support levels but are repeatedly failing to do so, as the bears have significant power over the market.
In conclusion, if the bulls break out of the symmetric triangle and push the price above the resistance zone at $1,613.53, the price will gain massive bullish momentum, continue to gain value, and test its upper resistance of $1,654.39 soon. Further, if the market holds the price at that level, it will continue rising and test its resistance level at $1,686.77 this week.
On the flip side, if the bears overpower the bulls and the ETH coin fails to hold its support level at $1,576.01, the price will lose momentum and continue to dip. Moreover, if the Ethereum price breaks down the triangle, the price will start trading under a strong bearish influence and will soon test its crucial support level at $1,539.01.

How the Fake News On ‘Spot Bitcoin ETF’ Shook On-Chain Metrics: BTC & ETH Profits Soar, While XRP, LTC, & ADA Remain Stable;"The latter half of October has unquestionably brought more shocks than most could have predicted. Just yesterday, the market experienced a sudden surge following a Cointelegraph tweet alleging the SEC’s approval of the proposed iShares ETF. Following coverage by other media outlets on the fake news, it triggered massive short liquidations exceeding a staggering $100 million. On-chain data reveals a significant spike over the last 24 hours, making high profits for Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, XRP, LTC, and ADA prices are now stable following selling at a loss. 
Cointelegraph’s statement sparked a surge in social media interactions, with terms such as ‘ETF,’ ‘iShares,’ and ‘$30K’ dominating discussions as a fleeting euphoria gripped the markets. Participants were surprised by the long-awaited breakthrough that had been anticipated since mid-summer. 
Santiment reveals that Bitcoin briefly surged above $30K for the first time in over two months, only to fall back to $28K within an hour. Amidst the general fallback in the crypto market, certain assets like Solana, Render, and UnlimitedIP notably defied the trend, with some values more than doubling, marking them as the standout victors of the episode. 
Amidst the turmoil from the false ETF approval report, it’s noteworthy that crypto markets were already gaining momentum, with a rally pushing values near $28K. Recent data showed a record number of wallets holding at least 10 BTC, suggesting ‘smart money’ confidence. However, the supply controlled by these mid-tier holders has stabilized since an early October spike.
Additionally, a decline in holdings among major Tether stakeholders indicates a slight purchasing power dip this month. Despite mixed signals from larger market players, overall trader sentiment leans bullish, a trend preceding the ETF confusion. This optimism, coupled with a lack of short positions, calls for caution, reflecting a setup similar to before the mid-August market drop.
During Bitcoin’s recent rise, negative sentiment spiked on social platforms, potentially stalling an immediate correction. As social volume hits recent highs due to ETF buzz, observers are watchful for genuine approval news, which could significantly move market directions.
In the wake of the recent fake news chaos, on-chain trading volume has seen its most significant surge since late August, with transaction volume (in USD) also climbing, marking positive indicators despite the confusion.
However, the daily movement of unique BTC tokens remains below the desired levels to support the current market cap. Token circulation, a key metric, has been in a ‘Bearish’ zone since August 2022, hindering a substantial breakout. Optimally, an uptick in this circulation, with signs of whale accumulation, would accelerate market health.

The latter half of October has unquestionably brought more shocks than most could have predicted. Just yesterday, the market experienced a sudden surge following a Cointelegraph tweet alleging the SEC’s approval of the proposed iShares ETF. Following coverage by other media outlets on the fake news, it triggered massive short liquidations exceeding a staggering $100 million. On-chain data reveals a significant spike over the last 24 hours, making high profits for Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, XRP, LTC, and ADA prices are now stable following selling at a loss. 
Cointelegraph’s statement sparked a surge in social media interactions, with terms such as ‘ETF,’ ‘iShares,’ and ‘$30K’ dominating discussions as a fleeting euphoria gripped the markets. Participants were surprised by the long-awaited breakthrough that had been anticipated since mid-summer. 
Santiment reveals that Bitcoin briefly surged above $30K for the first time in over two months, only to fall back to $28K within an hour. Amidst the general fallback in the crypto market, certain assets like Solana, Render, and UnlimitedIP notably defied the trend, with some values more than doubling, marking them as the standout victors of the episode. 
Amidst the turmoil from the false ETF approval report, it’s noteworthy that crypto markets were already gaining momentum, with a rally pushing values near $28K. Recent data showed a record number of wallets holding at least 10 BTC, suggesting ‘smart money’ confidence. However, the supply controlled by these mid-tier holders has stabilized since an early October spike.
Additionally, a decline in holdings among major Tether stakeholders indicates a slight purchasing power dip this month. Despite mixed signals from larger market players, overall trader sentiment leans bullish, a trend preceding the ETF confusion. This optimism, coupled with a lack of short positions, calls for caution, reflecting a setup similar to before the mid-August market drop.
During Bitcoin’s recent rise, negative sentiment spiked on social platforms, potentially stalling an immediate correction. As social volume hits recent highs due to ETF buzz, observers are watchful for genuine approval news, which could significantly move market directions.
In the wake of the recent fake news chaos, on-chain trading volume has seen its most significant surge since late August, with transaction volume (in USD) also climbing, marking positive indicators despite the confusion.
However, the daily movement of unique BTC tokens remains below the desired levels to support the current market cap. Token circulation, a key metric, has been in a ‘Bearish’ zone since August 2022, hindering a substantial breakout. Optimally, an uptick in this circulation, with signs of whale accumulation, would accelerate market health.

Shiba Inu: Can SHIB Rally 3X By Christmas 2023?;"Shiba Inu (SHIB) had a meteoric rise from its launch in August 2020 to reaching its all-time high in October 2021. Many early investors made millions with small investments as SHIB rallied by almost 85,000,000% (85 million percent). However, the popular memecoin has been on a downward trajectory after its peak. Since October 2021, SHIB is down by nearly 92%. Moreover, in 2023 alone, SHIB is down by 14.5%. Nonetheless, fans and investors are still hopeful that Shiba Inu can rally and reclaim its previous glory. 
Also Read: Shiba Inu: These Investors Earned Billions, Here’s What Happened
For Shiba Inu (SHIB) to 3X, it needs to reach a price of 0.00002076. This represents a growth of 200% from current levels. Although SHIB has displayed such growth before, whether or not Shiba Inu can rally before Christmas 2023, is debatable. Many were hopeful that a SHIB rally would be triggered by the project’s layer-2 network launch, Shibarium. However, the launch did little to nothing for SHIB’s price. Nonetheless, that does not mean that Shibarium was a failure. In fact, it’s quite the contrary. The network has continued to display healthy growth, and the number of users is increasing daily. Moreover, the network allows long-term SHIB adoption as more applications are built on SHIB. 
According to Changelly, SHIB will not reach $0.00002 anytime before 2025. However, this is not considering the fact that we may very well enter a crypto bull run next year. With a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF on the horizon and Bitcoin’s halving 5 months away, we may see a sudden price rise in early 2024. Moreover, as the anticipation for a bull run grows, more people may begin to invest in crypto, especially memecoins that have shown the potential to “moon.” 
Hence, SHIB may reach $0.00002 by Christmas this year. Moreover, the holiday season may spark a small rally as people gear up for the new year and for the anticipated crypto rally in early 2024.

Crypto-Terrorism Concerns? Senator Warren And 100 Lawmakers Push Biden For Swift Response;"In the middle of escalating tensions between Israel and Hamas, over 100 legislators, led by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Roger Marshall and Representative Sean Casten, have issued a bipartisan note urging the Biden administration to address alleged close relations between crypto and terrorism. 
The lawmakers express alarm over reported evidence suggesting that Hamas successfully evaded US sanctions, acquiring millions of dollars through crypto assets. They are now pressing the administration to clarify its strategy for tackling this critical national security threat.
The bipartisan letter, addressed to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Brian Nelson, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at the Department of the Treasury, highlights the concerns surrounding Hamas and Palestinian use of crypto funding. 
The letter states that between August 2021 and June of the following year, these organizations allegedly raised over $130 million in digital assets, with millions being transferred between them. 
The lawmakers stress the urgency of the situation, given the danger posed by the financing of militant organizations, and call on the Biden administration to provide details about its plan to prevent the use of crypto for terrorism financing.
In their letter, the lawmakers cite an article from the Wall Street Journal, which reports that researchers studying Hamas’s financing allegedly confirm that crypto remains one of several tools employed by the group to raise funds. 
While it has not been determined whether the crypto received by Hamas directly financed the October 7th terrorist attack on Israel, the group’s explicit solicitations for crypto have left no doubt about their intentions. 
Furthermore, the lawmakers highlight that both the Israeli and US governments have previously warned about the threat posed by crypto in the fight against terrorism. Israel has even seized crypto assets from terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah. 
However, experts believe that only a fraction of the digital asset funds flowing through Hamas have been successfully captured. 
In light of this, the lawmakers call for decisive action to address the risks associated with illicit crypto activity to prevent further tragedies. 
As Congress considers legislative proposals to mitigate alleged money laundering and illicit finance risks, they urge the Biden administration to swiftly and comprehensively act to curtail such activities and safeguard national security, as well as the security of US allies.
The lawmakers have set a deadline of October 31, 2023, for the Treasury and the Biden administration to respond to questions about their plans to address the serious national security threats arising from using crypto to finance terrorism.
As the debate surrounding the regulation of digital assets continues to intensify, the alleged crypto-financed terrorism adds another layer of complexity.

Tesla maintains Bitcoin holdings amid mixed Q3 financials;"Tesla, led by entrepreneur Elon Musk, revealed that it didn’t part ways with any of its $312 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) in the third quarter of 2023. Moreover, the company’s pile of Bitcoin lost approximately $9 million in value compared to the second quarter of this year. 
The last significant move Tesla made with its Bitcoin holdings was in the second quarter of 2022, when it liquidated around 75% of its holdings for $936 million. The automaker initially invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in early 2021.
After the stock market closed, Tesla shares dropped 4.78%, landing at a value of $242.68 per share. Despite holding its ground on Bitcoin, Tesla didn’t meet some key financial expectations. The company reported a revenue of $23.35 billion, falling short of the projected $23.9 billion. Additionally, Tesla disclosed adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share, missing the forecasted 73 cents. Tesla’s gross profit margin for Q3 also took a slight hit, coming in at 17.9% instead of the estimated 18%.
Tesla also shared other noteworthy updates in its Q3 report. Ahead of its planned November launch, the CYBERTRUCK pilot production has already exceeded 125,000 units. Furthermore, the automaker reduced prices on some electric vehicle models both in the U.S. and internationally. Tesla also dropped the price of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta software. The changes come after Tesla reported a 7% decline in vehicle deliveries for Q3 compared to the previous quarter. However, the company still aims to reach its target of 1.8 million vehicle deliveries for the full year of 2023.
This mixed financial performance follows Tesla’s routine of using Say Technologies, an online platform, to gather shareholder questions before revealing earnings reports. These revelations arrive at a time when Tesla has reduced the prices for its premium driver assistance software and some vehicle models in multiple markets. 
The unchanged Bitcoin holdings by Tesla may reflect a more conservative approach amid market uncertainties. While not explicitly stated, the automaker’s actions suggest a strategy of financial prudence on multiple fronts, from digital assets to vehicle production and sales. Consequently, all eyes are on Tesla as market watchers, investors, and consumers alike await the company’s next steps in the final quarter of the year.

The SEC is Finally Engaging With Bitcoin ETF Applicants: Cathie Wood;"After years of delaying and stonewalling a highly anticipated spot Bitcoin ETF, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is starting to have more productive conversations about the product with hopeful applicants.
One such hopeful is Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, who said on Monday that her company has noticed a positive “change in behavior” from the regulator.
During an interview with CNBC on Monday, Wood noted that Ark disclosed its response last week to a previous line of questions from the SEC, which sought clarifications on what risks a spot ETF could pose to investors, and measures Ark would take to address some of them.
In collaboration with 21Shares, Ark is one of twelve investment managers racing to launch a Bitcoin ETF in the United States, including firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and others.
“The fact that the SEC chose to ask questions is a change in behavior,” said Wood. “Therefore, I do think hopes are rising that a – or a number of – Bitcoin ETFs will be approved.
Wood isn’t the only one to notice the shift. On Tuesday, Fidelity provided an updated prospectus to the SEC on its Bitcoin ETF application, addressing similar questions that were posed to Ark. Some of its new details included wording around the mechanics of a Bitcoin hard fork, Bitcoin custodial arrangements, adherence to GAAP, Bitcoin’s energy consumption, and others.
“More proof that potential spot Bitcoin ETF issuers are in communication with SEC regarding changes/amendments required for SEC to consider approving,” said Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart about the update.
The following day, Mike Novogratz – CEO of Galaxy Digital – predicted that his and/or others’ ETF applications would be greenlighted by the SEC by the end of the year, highlighting how dialogue with the SEC “is all heading in the right direction.”
“When you go to the comment period and what they’re asking about, [it] all seems much more specific than general,” Novogratz said in a CNBC interview.
Working in the applicants’ favor is the SEC’s recent court loss to Grayscale – the world’s largest Bitcoin fund. In August, judges unanimously ruled that the agency’s denial of Grayscale’s conversion into a spot ETF was “arbitrary and capricious” given that it had already approved similar, cash-based futures products.
As of Friday, the SEC’s window to appeal the ruling has now closed. As such, the court is poised to instruct the SEC on how to proceed with handling Grayscale’s application, which may result in outright approval.
Some have suggested that the SEC may respond to its Grayscale loss by rescinding approval for prior Bitcoin futures ETFs, though experts contacted by CryptoPotato view this outcome as unlikely.
Independent of Grayscale, Ark’s ETF application is the first to require a firm and final decision on whether or not to approve by January 10.
“A number of Bitcoin ETFs could be approved at the same time,” Wood said.

Fidelity Submits Updated Spot Bitcoin ETF Application;"Fidelity has submitted an updated proposal for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The asset manager joins other applicants in continued efforts to address regulatory concerns that have stood in the way of approving the investment product.
Financial giant Fidelity has submitted a revised version of its Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust to the U.S. securities regulator. The updated spot bitcoin ETF prospectus seeks to meet SEC requirements which could increase the chances of approval.
With the new filing, Fidelity joins other potential issuers that have tried to address the regulator’s concerns in various areas. Invesco and Ark Invest refiled their applications earlier in October.
Bloomberg’s James Seyffart views these moves as positive signs. The ETF analyst commented on the latest development in a post on X, formerly Twitter:
More proof that potential spot Bitcoin ETF issuers are in communication with SEC regarding changes/amendments required for SEC to consider approving. Positive signs IMO.
Seyffart share a tweet by finance Lawyer Scott Johnsson who highlighted several common themes that appear in the amended applications. These include detailing custodial arrangements, addressing hard forks and the energy intensive nature of crypto mining.
Recurring themes I’m seeing in the amendments so far:
– Specifying custodial arrangements in detail
– Mechanics around hard forks
– Valuation/pricing sources and adherence to GAAP
– Risk disclosure around regulatory uncertainty
– Mining is very energy intensive… https://t.co/sFJqwznuzr

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ETFs holding bitcoin futures in 2021 but the agency has been reluctant to give the nod to a spot bitcoin ETF, previously citing risks of fraud and market manipulation as well as concerns over custody and investor protection.
Earlier this year, the SEC accepted to review a number of applications but has since delayed its decisions on the proposals of Fidelity, financial powerhouse Blackrock, Vaneck, Wisdomtree, Valkyrie, Bitwise, and Invesco among others.
The Commission’s judgement on one or more ETFs is expected by many in the industry in the first quarter of next year with events such as the SEC recently missing the deadline to appeal a court ruling in favor of Grayscale’s spot bitcoin ETF giving cause for optimism. As a proof of the growing anticipation, bitcoin (BTC) surged this week on fake news that Blackrock’s bitcoin ETF had been approved.
Do you think the SEC will approve the updated applications for spot bitcoin ETFs? Share your thoughts on the subject in the comments section below.

Financial giant Fidelity has submitted a revised version of its Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust to the U.S. securities regulator. The updated spot bitcoin ETF prospectus seeks to meet SEC requirements which could increase the chances of approval.
With the new filing, Fidelity joins other potential issuers that have tried to address the regulator’s concerns in various areas. Invesco and Ark Invest refiled their applications earlier in October.
Bloomberg’s James Seyffart views these moves as positive signs. The ETF analyst commented on the latest development in a post on X, formerly Twitter:
More proof that potential spot Bitcoin ETF issuers are in communication with SEC regarding changes/amendments required for SEC to consider approving. Positive signs IMO.
Seyffart share a tweet by finance Lawyer Scott Johnsson who highlighted several common themes that appear in the amended applications. These include detailing custodial arrangements, addressing hard forks and the energy intensive nature of crypto mining.
Recurring themes I’m seeing in the amendments so far:
– Specifying custodial arrangements in detail
– Mechanics around hard forks
– Valuation/pricing sources and adherence to GAAP
– Risk disclosure around regulatory uncertainty
– Mining is very energy intensive… https://t.co/sFJqwznuzr

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ETFs holding bitcoin futures in 2021 but the agency has been reluctant to give the nod to a spot bitcoin ETF, previously citing risks of fraud and market manipulation as well as concerns over custody and investor protection.
Earlier this year, the SEC accepted to review a number of applications but has since delayed its decisions on the proposals of Fidelity, financial powerhouse Blackrock, Vaneck, Wisdomtree, Valkyrie, Bitwise, and Invesco among others.
The Commission’s judgement on one or more ETFs is expected by many in the industry in the first quarter of next year with events such as the SEC recently missing the deadline to appeal a court ruling in favor of Grayscale’s spot bitcoin ETF giving cause for optimism. As a proof of the growing anticipation, bitcoin (BTC) surged this week on fake news that Blackrock’s bitcoin ETF had been approved.
Do you think the SEC will approve the updated applications for spot bitcoin ETFs? Share your thoughts on the subject in the comments section below.

Xsolla integrates XRP, boosting crypto in gaming;"BitPay, a renowned cryptocurrency payment provider, has unveiled its latest integration, allowing gamers to use XRP on Xsolla. This update marks another step towards the widespread adoption of digital currencies in the gaming sector. Xsolla, a global gaming platform established in 2005, has been at the forefront of providing innovative solutions to developers, enabling them to efficiently launch, market, and monetize games on multiple platforms.
Moreover, Xsolla has always been proactive in its approach to global distribution. The company aims to resolve game developers’ challenges while reaching different markets, maximizing revenues, and forming meaningful partnerships with top gamers. Additionally, in their pursuit of connecting with the global financial ecosystem, Xsolla has revealed its upcoming participation at Money 20/20 in Las Vegas.
This isn’t the first collaboration between Xsolla and BitPay. In 2014, the two firms joined hands, with Xsolla embracing BitPay’s BTC processing capabilities for its global gamer base. Since then, their partnership has flourished, with Xsolla expanding its payment options to include various cryptocurrencies available through BitPay. Significantly, BitPay recently made an announcement highlighting Xsolla’s move to accept the stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), for online purchases.
However, it’s essential to note BitPay’s journey with XRP. In 2019, BitPay incorporated XRP support, an initiative backed by Ripple’s investment division, Xpring. Yet, following the SEC’s allegations against Ripple, BitPay paused XRP transactions. Fortunately for XRP enthusiasts, after a court ruling that classified XRP as a non-security, BitPay reintegrated XRP in August. Consequently, BitPay’s users can now enjoy the flexibility of using XRP for various transactions, from buying gift cards to shopping with merchants like AMC Theaters, Newegg, and Namecheap.
Besides BitPay, Ripple’s partnership ventures extend to other companies as well. For instance, Ripple’s recent collaboration with Lunu enables luxury retailers in Berlin to process digital currency transactions, including XRP. FCF Pay’s new offering also allows Bitcoin miners to settle their electricity bills using XRP.

Grayscale Files New S-3 With SEC, Pushing to Convert Bitcoin Trust Into NYSE Spot ETF After Court Win ;"Grayscale Investments, the leading digital asset manager by assets under management (AUM), unveiled on Thursday its latest submission to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This move seeks to list the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) on NYSE Arca. Grayscale’s latest S-3 submission comes on the heels of Grayscale’s victory in court last August. At the time, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the SEC’s previous denial of Grayscale’s registration bid.
Undeterred by previous roadblocks, Grayscale is pressing forward with its ETF registration endeavor, with the ambition to morph GBTC into a publicly traded fund on NYSE Arca. This comes on the back of a D.C. Circuit judge’s ruling in August, pointing out the SEC’s failure to justify the “different treatment of similar products” such as bitcoin futures ETFs.
Post-ruling, Grayscale communicated to the securities regulator that the process should be fast-tracked, allowing GBTC to transition into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Adding to this, the SEC failed to adhere to the 45-day deadline to appeal the D.C. court’s verdict. In a bid to expedite the process, Grayscale has chosen to file another S-3 application, which essentially serves as a synopsis of a conventional S-1 prospectus.
“Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest crypto asset manager, today announced it filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-3 to register shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,” the firm declared on Thursday.
The S-3 announcement dovetails with GBTC’s recent ascension. To illustrate, in January 2023, GBTC’s discount to its net asset value (NAV) exceeded 48%. Just last week, the figure had dwindled to 16.59%, and by October 18, 2023, the discount had shrunk further to 12.54%.
The latest GBTC statistics indicate that investors are already viewing GBTC through a new lens, even prior to its approval. Grayscale operates under the umbrella of the Digital Currency Group (DCG), serving as one of its five major subsidiaries.

Robert Kiyosaki stresses awareness in unpredictable market times;"Renowned financial literacy expert Robert Kiyosaki recently emphasized the unpredictability engulfing the global market, advocating for heightened awareness and kindness during these tumultuous times. Through a message on the social platform X, formerly known as Twitter, the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author drew on wisdom from philosopher Dr. Bucky Fuller. He highlighted that unseen challenges often go unaddressed, putting individuals at risk.
Kiyosaki’s stance is clear: the current global instability demands vigilance. He advises the public to “see with your ears, listen with your heart, trust your intuition, and be extra kind to others.” This approach is crucial for navigating the present financial uncertainty.
Besides his recent focus on kindness and intuition, Kiyosaki is a long-time advocate of investing in safe-haven assets like Bitcoin, gold, and silver. He predicts significant growth in these commodities, foreseeing a substantial value increase by 2025. Additionally, he has emphasized silver’s prospective industrial applications, suggesting its affordability makes it an accessible investment for the average person.
Kiyosaki’s investment insights extend to the tech industry as well. Recently, he hinted at the profitability of Apple shares. This speculation came after Apple CEO Tim Cook sold some of his shares and several banks downgraded them. “Maybe it is time to buy Apple,” Kiyosaki shared, indicating potential undervaluation.
However, Kiyosaki’s financial strategies often circle back to a skepticism towards traditional fiat currency, particularly the U.S. dollar. He asserts that the dollar’s impending decline is an opportunity for Bitcoin to thrive. This perspective gained momentum in 2020 amidst global economic pressures and unprecedented U.S. money printing. Consequently, Kiyosaki became a vocal proponent of alternative assets like Bitcoin, expecting its value to skyrocket to $500,000 by 2025, though he later adjusted this to a more conservative $150,000.
Significantly, Kiyosaki’s investment approach favors direct ownership of assets. Despite the market’s anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving Bitcoin spot ETFs, he prefers to hold actual commodities and cryptocurrencies.

Leading Video Game Company Embraces XRP As Price Faces Key Resistance;"BitPay, the pioneering crypto payment service provider based in Atlanta, Georgia, has taken another significant step in its collaboration with global video game commerce company, Xsolla, by integrating the XRP token. Today, October 17, BitPay announced via X (formerly Twitter): “Xsolla now accepts XRP with BitPay as a payment method for their games, such as SMITE and Roblox. You can use your favorite cryptocurrency to buy, play, and enjoy gaming like never before.”
This announcement not only cements XRP’s growing relevance in the gaming world but also marks a significant moment in the longstanding partnership between Xsolla and BitPay. This relationship first began in 2014 when Xsolla decided to process Bitcoin (BTC) payments for gamers globally via BitPay. They’ve since expanded their crypto payment offerings, with the recent addition of PayPal USD (PYUSD) last month.
Established in 2005 by Aleksandr Agapitov, Xsolla has positioned itself as an instrumental force in the gaming industry, providing essential tools that help game developers launch, monetize, and distribute their creations on a global scale. With Xsolla’s key focus on aiding its partners to break geographical barriers and bolster revenue streams, the company continually seeks innovative solutions to global game distribution challenges.
Roblox, the popular online gaming platform boasting over 65.5 million daily active users and over 202 million monthly active users, stands out as a significant beneficiary of the XRP integration. Managed by Xsolla for in-game payments, Roblox now allows its vast user base to utilize XRP for transactions, with BitPay ensuring a smooth connection with crypto wallets. Given that Roblox users spent an astonishing $780.7 million on in-game purchases in just the second quarter of 2023, the potential volume of XRP transactions on the platform could be monumental.
Remarkably, BitPay’s association with XRP can be traced back to 2019 when they collaborated with Ripple’s investment wing, Xpring. However, the relationship hit a snag when BitPay, in alignment with many US-based crypto enterprises, ceased XRP-related transactions following the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs. The tide turned in favor of XRP when Judge Torres identified it as a non-security, prompting BitPay to reintroduce the cryptocurrency on its platform in August.
The recent announcement undoubtedly solidifies XRP’s position in the broader market, showcasing its versatility. However, despite the promising long-term prospects stemming from XRP’s new use case, its price is currently contending with multiple key resistance levels.
Following a brief surge yesterday, attributed to the fake news surrounding a potential spot Bitcoin ETF, XRP’s price experienced a pullback, dipping below the $0.50 mark.
On the 4-hour chart, the price slid beneath the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, pegged at $0.4908. Yet, it demonstrated resilience, rebounding and securing a close above the 20-EMA. In the more immediate time frame, the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, set at $0.5048, now emerges as the pivotal resistance. A sustained close above this threshold on the 4-hour chart might be the catalyst for renewed bullish vigor.
Should this momentum be achieved, the next focal point for the XRP price would be the September high of $0.55. Notably, this price benchmark isn’t just crucial for short-term analysis but also holds significance on larger scales, like the 1-day chart, as reported previously.

What Grayscale’s S-3 registration means for its spot Bitcoin ETF prospects;"On Oct. 19, Grayscale Investments filed an S-3 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).
This move reflects the company’s aspiration to list the shares on NYSE Arca (a subsidiary of the NYSE headquartered in Chicago)under the GBTC symbol.
Form S-3 registrations are regulatory filings used to simplify the reporting process for issuers of registered securities, providing a streamlined route for companies wishing to raise capital. With the filing of an S-3 form, Grayscale has expressed its readiness to issue shares on an ongoing basis upon the approval of NYSE Arca’s application on Form 19b-4 to list the shares and the effectiveness of the Form S-3 to register the shares.
In other words, filing Form S-3 signifies that Grayscale is confident it met all its reporting requirements to the SEC and has requested the go-ahead to register and issue shares.
The recent decision by the SEC not to appeal Grayscale’s court victory potentially hastens the review of Grayscale’s application. The SEC’s reluctance to challenge the August court ruling could ultimately result in a Bitcoin spot ETF, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without direct ownership. This has been a longstanding goal for Grayscale, as it could alleviate the significant discount GBTC shares currently trade at compared to its net asset value due to the trust’s lack of redemption features.
This pivotal development arrives following a lengthy legal battle centered around the SEC’s inconsistent handling of spot and futures Bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale argued that both fund types share similar risks and are priced based on the same underlying spot markets. The appeals court agreed, stating the SEC had failed to substantiate the substantial difference between the two arrangements, leading to the unjust rejection of Grayscale’s application.
Moreover, in light of the SEC’s decision not to contest the court ruling, other asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco may see their similar filings for a spot Bitcoin ETF expedited. Grayscale has described itself as “operationally ready” to convert GBTC into an ETF immediately upon receiving SEC approval.

Grayscale argued that both fund types share similar risks and are priced based on the same underlying spot markets. The appeals court agreed, stating the SEC had failed to substantiate the substantial difference between the two arrangements, leading to the unjust rejection of Grayscale’s application.
Moreover, in light of the SEC’s decision not to contest the court ruling, other asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco may see their similar filings for a spot Bitcoin ETF expedited. Grayscale has described itself as “operationally ready” to convert GBTC into an ETF immediately upon receiving SEC approval.

Bitcoin’s Volatile Ride Continues Amidst Spot ETF Speculation – Grayscale’s CLO Highlights The Amazing Progress;"The post Bitcoin’s Volatile Ride Continues Amidst Spot ETF Speculation – Grayscale’s CLO Highlights The Amazing Progress appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Bitcoin’s recent price action has been a rollercoaster ride, and many wonder where it’s headed. Bitcoin sharply jumped to $30,000 following news of a supposed BlackRock Spot ETF approval from the SEC. However, this news turned out to be fake, leading to an immediate rejection back to the downside.
The possibility of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is no longer a matter of “if” but “when,” according to Craig Salm, the Chief Legal Officer at Grayscale Investments. Salm shared his positive outlook on a recent SiriusXM radio show.
This comes after the SEC’s decision not to appeal an August court ruling, which directed the SEC to reconsider Grayscale’s request to transform its flagship GBTC fund into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale Investments has been actively engaged in discussions and efforts related to this development.
“The fact that we have two bills making it through committee going to the House floor is an amazing amount of progress in D.C. that we have not seen in the crypto space today,” he said as reported by Blockworks.
Meanwhile, Grayscale is expanding its presence in the cryptocurrency market. Their Grayscale Ethereum Trust (trading under the ticker ETHE) manages $5 billion in assets under management (AUM). It constitutes over 2% of the circulating supply of Ethereum (ETH) at the time of reporting. In addition to their existing offerings, Grayscale has applied for a new Grayscale Ethereum futures ETF. 
Besides BlackRock and Fidelity, several other applicants, including Bitwise, Invesco, WisdomTree, VanEck, Valkyrie, Global X, 21Shares, and Ark Invest, have entered the scene. Currently, the SEC is actively reviewing all these proposals.

Ripple: XRP Whale Moves $200 Million In Tokens to New Wallet;"According to Whale Alert, an XRP whale has moved 410 million tokens worth a whopping $201 million from the crypto exchange Bitvavo to a new wallet. As per the data, the wallet is brand new. Hence, we may be looking at a new whale, or an entity buying more tokens. The move follows a massive selloff in the crypto market after fake reports of the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) approving BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) application made rounds online.  
   409,776,402 #XRP (201,627,816 USD) transferred from #Bitvavo to unknown new wallethttps://t.co/j0ho6BYxce

Furthermore, the movement of tokens from an exchange to a wallet has given some relief to XRP holders. The movement of assets away from exchanges reduces the probability of them being sold. 
Nonetheless, the XRP Whale’s move did not have a positive impact on the token’s price. XRP is down by 0.7% in the daily charts and by 1.7% over the last week. 
Since the beginning of the year, XRP is up by almost 44.12%. This is better than Ethereum’s (ETH) almost 35% but falls short of Bitcoin’s (BTC) almost 60% growth in the same time frame. Moreover, Solana’s (SOL) performance since January completely eclipses that of all three with almost 120% gains. 
Nonetheless, many anticipate XRP to gain momentum in the fourth quarter of 2024. According to Sistine Research, the token has the potential to reach a price of $1.5. This represents a growth of almost 200% from current price levels. However, the research firm highlights that the token could fall to a low of about $0.40 before making any positive strides.

U.S. Treasury to curb crypto mixers over money laundering concerns;"The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed labeling crypto mixers as a “primary money laundering concern.” The move comes as part of FinCEN’s robust initiative to enhance transparency in cryptocurrency transactions, specifically those that can be exploited by terrorist groups and state-affiliated cybercriminals. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo affirmed that this action exemplifies the Treasury’s ongoing commitment to halting the misuse of Convertible Virtual Currency (CVC) mixing by various illegal entities worldwide.
FinCEN’s notice of proposed rulemaking is currently open for public comment for a 90-day period. The agency cited its determination to address the usage of crypto mixers by illicit actors, specifically naming groups like Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Once finalized, the rule would place several obligations on U.S. financial institutions, from enforcing additional due diligence to potentially prohibiting certain types of accounts.
Moreover, this action marks FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki’s “first-ever use” of the agency’s authority to target a broad class of transactions as primary money laundering concerns. This expansion of power signals a pivotal moment in the government’s approach to combating financial crimes in the digital age.
Additionally, the Treasury Department has been facing increased pressure from lawmakers to curb the exploitation of cryptocurrencies for terror financing. This scrutiny heightened following reports that Hamas received crypto donations in the lead-up to its recent attack in Israel. Consequently, these proposed measures are not isolated; they align with the Treasury’s broader strategy. This includes the sanctions announced earlier this week against entities and individuals connected to Hamas, which involved a Gaza-based business suspected of acting as a Bitcoin conduit for terrorism.
The proposed rule comes after multiple Treasury actions aimed at combating illicit finance involving crypto mixers. In February 2022, a National Money Laundering Risk Assessment identified an uptick in using anonymity-enhancing technologies, including crypto mixing. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) also designated several mixing services, like Blender.io and Tornado Cash, accused of facilitating large-scale financial crimes.
The Treasury appears committed to staying ahead of the curve in identifying and mitigating risks associated with crypto transactions. This is particularly important as criminals continue to adapt, leveraging technologies like blockchain to obfuscate their financial activities.

Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Remains Near 2-Month High, Following Strong US Retail Sales;"Bitcoin remained near a two-month high on Tuesday, as markets digested the latest retail sales figures from the United States. Sales, which account for two thirds of the U.S. economy, rose by 0.7% in September, 0.4% higher than expected. Ethereum briefly rose above $1,600.
Bitcoin continued to trade above $28,000 on Tuesday, following a better than expected increase in U.S. retail sales.
Despite slipping from a peak of $30,000 on Monday, BTC/USD traded above $28,600 in today’s session.
Although gains have eased, this was still considerably higher than yesterday’s low at the $27,855.21 level.
Overall, the recent upward trend means bitcoin is trading at its highest rate since August 18, which comes after the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a key resistance level.
The index surged beyond a ceiling at 63.00 in yesterday’s session, peaking above the 65.00 mark.
Price strength has since retreated, however is still marginally above the aforementioned point of resistance.
Ethereum (ETH), was lower in today’s session, after a brief stint trading above the $1,600 mark for the first time in almost ten days.
ETH/USD peaked at $1,628.16 to start the week, on the back of a tweet from Cointelegraph that suggested Blackrock’s spot bitcoin ETF was approved.
After these claims were proven to be incorrect, the cryptocurrency has since slipped, falling to a low at $1,570.89 earlier today.
As a result of Tuesday’s decline, bears have snapped a four-day win streak, and could now be targeting a floor at $1,540.
From the chart, it appears that a failure to move beyond a ceiling at 49.00 on the RSI indicator also contributed to today’s decline.

Bitcoin Wallets With Over 100 BTC Witness Biggest Jump in 2023;"According to crypto analysis firm Santiment, the number of Bitcoin (BTC) wallets with more than 100 BTC recently saw the most significant single-day jump in 2023. As per the data, wallets with over 100 BTC have reached a whopping 15,970 as of last Saturday. The cost of 100 BTC at current price levels is around $2,845,100 ($2.8 million). 
 #Bitcoin's number of wallets holding at least 100 $BTC has jumped to 15,970 after the largest single day jump of 2023 on Saturday. Since this accumulation, $BTC's price is +5.3%, and they may not be done. We will continue to monitor. https://t.co/l0drhvkf7E pic.twitter.com/0mDAmys7N4
Also Read: Tesla Sold None of Their $312,000,000 Bitcoin in Q3 2023
The jump also coincides with a jump in accumulation among big pro-BTC firms such as Tesla and Microstrategy. According to analyst Ali Martinez, these firms acquired the original crypto around the $25k-$30k level. Hence, this price level holds a lot of volumes for Bitcoin (BTC). 
Also Read: Bitcoin: MicroStrategy Buys $147 Million BTC Amid Outflows
Moreover, Microstrategy bought about 5,445 BTC, worth around $147 million, towards the end of last month. As of Sept. 24, 2023, the company held 158,245 BTC, worth a whopping $4.68 billion. The average price for each BTC for Microstrategy is around $29,582.
London-based Standard Chartered Bank has said that it has chosen Dubai as its base for launching crypto services. The bank will start by providing crypto custody services for institutional clients in the first quarter of 2024. 
According to Waqar Chaudry, Executive Director of Innovation at Standard Chartered, “Back in 2018, when places like Singapore and the UAE were busy consulting on crypto assets, some other regions had not even made the distinction between a security and non-security status when it came to crypto assets.”

The UAE (United Arab Emirates) is one of the fastest-growing crypto adoption and innovation hubs.

Grayscale Craig Salm is Optimistic About Incoming Bitcoin ETF!;"The post Grayscale Craig Salm is Optimistic About Incoming Bitcoin ETF! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Grayscale Investments’ Chief Legal Officer, Craig Salm, believes that a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a matter of when and not if, following the SEC’s decision not to appeal an August court ruling ordering it to reconsider Grayscale’s GBTC fund into a spot bitcoin ETF. Salm said the firm has been spending a lot of time in Washington as lawmakers consider two bills to regulate cryptocurrencies. However, a decision not to appeal does not necessarily mean that the regulator plans to approve a spot bitcoin ETF. On Monday, rumors of SEC approval caused bitcoin to surge towards $30,000.

Expert witness reveals FTX falsified wallet balance;"In November 2021, the cryptocurrency market was riding high, with investors and traders believing they held roughly $20 billion in digital assets on the FTX exchange. However, an expert witness in the criminal trial of FTX’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, recently revealed that the reality was quite different. According to Notre Dame Alumni Professor of Accountancy, Peter Easton, who specializes in financial statement analysis, FTX’s digital wallets contained closer to $5 billion in crypto at the peak of the industry’s boom when Bitcoin’s price surged to $69,000.
Easton’s assessment, based on meticulous analysis, uncovered a significant gap between what customers believed they had in their FTX accounts and what the exchange’s digital wallets held. He emphasized the robustness of his assessment, attributing it to the wealth of “much finer data” recorded on the blockchain, which was more reliable than tracking the flow of FTX customers’ fiat deposits. The professor’s research was conducted at the request of prosecutors and drew from various sources, including bank statements, a massive FTX database, documents from lenders, and publicly available blockchain data.
His findings were presented in a Manhattan courthouse, providing crucial insights into the inner workings of FTX and Alameda Research. One of the key revelations in Easton’s presentation was the difference between on-chain balances for FTX’s “sweep” wallets and customer balances in the exchange’s database. He explained that each FTX customer had a digital wallet address associated with their account. When they deposited funds, these funds were swept to another wallet that pooled customer assets. Easton’s investigation revealed that since January 2021, the firm’s digital wallets consistently held billions of dollars less than what was indicated in customer accounts.
This discrepancy persisted through October 2022. To put this into perspective, less than a week before FTX faced a downfall, customer account balances appeared to total $11.4 billion. However, in reality, the exchange’s digital wallets held just over $1 billion in crypto assets, according to Easton’s analysis. The question that naturally arises is where did the missing billions go? Easton’s assessment strongly suggests that these funds must have been spent by Alameda Research, a significant player in the crypto space, which held a total of 57 accounts on the platform. These accounts frequently had negative balances, with Easton’s analysis revealing that Alameda’s accounts showed negative balances on FTX amounting to $12.6 billion in May 2022.
What sets Peter Easton apart in this high-profile trial is his decades-long expertise in deciphering financial statements. With nearly 40 years of experience, he has been researching and analyzing financial data longer than Sam Bankman-Fried and many other individuals involved in the case have been alive. Sam Bankman-Fried, the former crypto mogul, is currently facing seven charges of fraud and conspiracy related to the collapse of FTX last year. The accusations claim that Bankman-Fried misappropriated billions of dollars in cash and cryptocurrency from his now-defunct exchange through Alameda Research, using the funds at his discretion. He has maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty to all charges.
As Easton introduced himself to the jury, he also highlighted his past involvement in unraveling the financial complexities of Enron after the energy giant’s notorious collapse in 2007. Interestingly, FTX’s current CEO, John Jay Ray III, took over leadership at Enron during its bankruptcy proceedings. Despite an attempt by Bankman-Fried’s defense team in September to exclude Easton’s testimony, it proved unsuccessful. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled that the accountant’s assessment of FTX and Alameda’s financial discrepancies was not “improper narration” but rather the result of specialized knowledge and a reliable methodology.

Don’t Count on Bitcoin Collapse to Previous Lows, Says Crypto Analyst Jason Pizzino – Here’s Why;"A widely followed crypto analyst says the odds are looking good that Bitcoin (BTC) will not revisit its prior cycle lows.
In a new strategy session, crypto trader Jason Pizzino tells his 290,000 YouTube subscribers that based on Bitcoin’s four-year cycle history, the king crypto will likely hold its key support levels and head into a new bull market.
He also says that the current strength of the S&P 500  is showing similarities to past BTC cycles, and predicts the SPX will soon hit new all-time highs within months.
The four-year cycle is based on Bitcoin’s halving event when rewards issued to BTC miners are cut in half every four years.
“The main thing is it is almost guaranteed that $15,500 is not going to break. And potentially we won’t see closes under the March low either, which is at $19,500, something that I’ve talked about for a long time on the channel now. 
So you can basically call it roughly seven months when that low came in. It looked relatively strong, and it has looked very strong for the S&P 500 in the traditional markets, which is something else that we look at for our four-year cycle. 
Within the four-year cycle, the main thing I want to bring up here is the S&P typically breaks to a new all-time high before Bitcoin breaks to a new all-time high. And we’ve seen that in the previous accumulation years.”
The trader says the S&P 500 will likely hit a new all-time high in early 2024 and possibly another one by about January 2025.
“I think we’ll at least see one new all-time high, maybe a pullback, and then the next one, possibly on the verge of the next Bitcoin bull market as well.
 So that’s going to be another key signal for the markets as we continue to watch what happens in the stock markets, as the bull market continues on for the stock market as well.”
Bitcoin is trading for $28,310 at time of writing.

"Cathie Wood says ‘hopes are rising’ for spot Bitcoin ETF; Larry Fink addresses role of crypto in restless markets";"Cathie Wood, the CEO and CIO of ARK Invest, commented on pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications during a CNBC interview on Oct. 16.
As ARK Invest is one of several asset managers pursuing a spot Bitcoin ETF, Wood began by describing the current state of her company’s application, stating:
“It was publicized and disclosed last week that we had responded to the SEC’s request for information around our Bitcoin filing, and we responded. That’s basically all we can say.”
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published initial requests for comments on select spot Bitcoin ETF applications in late September. Though ARK Invest was not one of the firms that initially received a request from the agency, it nevertheless responded by updating its application on Oct. 11.
During the current interview, Wood suggested that the SEC’s questions indicate that the agency’s stance toward spot Bitcoin ETFs is changing. She added that the SEC’s decision to seek information could signify that “hopes are rising” for spot Bitcoin ETFs.
When the interviewer suggested that many commentators believe a spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved by the end of the year, Wood suggested that this could be due to ARK’s own approval deadline. The SEC must reach a decision on ARK’s proposal by Jan. 10, 2024. Though ARK’s application is first in line, Wood noted that multiple ETFs could be approved at once — echoing one of her earlier statements from August.
Wood’s comments followed a few hours of frantic trading after rumors circulated on social media that the SEC had approved BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF application; those rumors, however, were unfounded.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink appeared later in the day on Fox Business, saying in an interview that he had “only heard [about] it an hour ago,” implying that he was unfamiliar with the rumor. In the same interview, however, he expressed the view that today’s rally was likely primed by markets’ growing interest in a “flight to quality” among growing geopolitical tensions connected to Hamas’ war against Israel.
Crypto, Fink said, alongside Treasuries and gold, may appeal to investors as for this reason.
The SEC has not issued any updates on spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, and individual members of the SEC have not commented on the BlackRock approval rumor.

Lightning Network transactions increased by 1,212% in two years;"The Lightning Network, a second-layer (L2) solution built atop the Bitcoin blockchain, has drastically changed the way the crypto market perceives transaction speeds and costs.
Designed to address the scalability issues of Bitcoin, it facilitates instant, low-cost transactions by creating off-chain payment channels. This solution ensures that not every transaction must be recorded on the main blockchain, significantly reducing congestion and fees.
However, estimating the exact number and volume of transactions on the Lightning Network is a complex endeavor. The network architecture inherently makes it challenging for external observers to determine the precise transaction count. This is primarily because a significant portion of direct (between two nodes) and private transactions remain undisclosed for privacy reasons. Without comprehensive data from a vast majority of nodes, it’s nearly impossible to provide an accurate upper bound of transactions on the network.
To gauge the transaction metrics, River analyzed data from nodes representing 52% of the public capacity on the Lightning Network. Based on this data, it’s estimated that there were around 6.6 million routed transactions on the Lightning Network in August 2023. This represents a staggering 1,212% increase from the August 2021 estimated 503k transactions.
In terms of volume, approximately $78.2 million (equivalent to 2,950 BTC) was publicly routed on the network in August 2023, marking a 546% rise from the August 2021 estimate of $12.1 million.
These numbers are significant for several reasons. Firstly, they underscore the growing adoption and trust in the Lightning Network’s capabilities. The exponential growth in transactions and volume, even amidst a 44% Bitcoin price drop, indicates that users are increasingly leveraging the network for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Secondly, when juxtaposed with Bitcoin’s on-chain transactions, the Lightning Network already exhibits a higher velocity, suggesting that it’s facilitating a more rapid exchange of value in the ecosystem.
For the market, these metrics indicate a maturing and robust second-layer solution that successfully addresses Bitcoin’s scalability issues. The surge in transactions and volume underscores the network’s potential to handle a substantial portion of global microtransactions, further solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a store of value and a medium of exchange.

Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: October End 2023;"Since the beginning of 2023, Ethereum (ETH) is up by almost 30%. Despite being down by 6.1% over the previous month, ETH has proven to be a lucrative asset to hold over the long term. Nonetheless, ETH’s returns this year are vastly outshined by Bitcoin’s (BTC) almost 60% gain in the same time frame.

According to the forecast by CoinCodex, Ethereum (ETH) could reach a high of $1,638.41 by Oct. 31, 2023. The gain translates to a growth of about 5.6% from current price levels. Furthermore, the platform also forecasts that ETH’s price could breach the $1,800 level in early November.  
According to the machine learning algorithm at PricePredictions, ETH’s price will continue to hover in the $1.5k level, possibly hitting $1,504.14 on Oct. 31, a drop of 3.03% from current levels. Moreover, it predicts a bearish trajectory for ETH for most of November.  
Changelly, on the other hand, shares their price prediction that Ethereum (ETH) will reach a $1,669.59 on Oct. 31. The change represents a growth of about 7.6% from current price levels. The platform also predicts that ETH will continue rising till mid-November before cooling down. 
According to a recent report by Standard Chartered, ETH could reach a price of $8,000 by 2026. The rise represents a growth of about 415.8% from current levels. Furthermore, the bank says that ETH has the potential to reach a price of $35,000 by the year 2040, a growth of 2156.6% from current levels.

Standard Chartered’s bullish outlook for ETH is based on the project’s innovative developments, such as smart contracts, gaming, and tokenization of assets.

Novogratz Says SEC Will Approve Spot Bitcoin ETF This Year;"The founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings, Mike Novogratz, has said that he believes the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a Spot Bitcoin ETF this year. During an interview with CNBC, Novogratz confirmed his expectation with approval, stating, “We actually think it’s going to happen in 2023. 
Additionally, Novogratz noted the most important aspect of the impending approval was the Grayscale Court victory over the agency. Specifically, he articulated the SEC loss as “the most significant piece” to eventually see the exchanged-traded fund receive regulatory approval.

For much of this year, the quest for a Spot Bitcoin ETF has dominated the digital asset industry. Traditional finance entities like Fidelity and BlackRock shocked the market when they announced their respective applications for the service. Yet, the SEC has continued a string of delays, extending its streak of rejections. 
However, there are many who are optimistic about the product’s arrival. Specifically, Mike Novogratz says that he believes the SEC will approve a Spot Bitcoin ETF application this year. Indeed, he noted that surely “it’s going to get approved” during a recent interview.

In August of this year, the SEC came out on the losing end of a Grayscale Investment lawsuit. Subsequently, the SEC was court-mandated to reassess the application to convert Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. Therefore, with a rejection already reversed, the chances for approval increased.
Novogratz stated his opinion that the court defeat is “the most significant piece” to getting approval. Although many are optimistic, the chances of seeing approval in the next two months remain a longshot. However, Novogratz’s confidence seems to speak to the potential of it taking place.

Fantom Foundation Wallets Drained, More Pain For FTM Holders As Prices Tank;"Two Fantom Foundation wallets on Ethereum and the Fantom Network have fallen victim to a phishing attack, losing over $650,000, according to reports from CertiK, a blockchain security firm. Another report by “Spreakaway” on X alleges that one of Fantom’s team members also lost $3.4 million.
Fantom Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the growth and development of the Fantom ecosystem. On the other hand, Fantom is a scalable, layer-1 blockchain that is compatible with Ethereum. Like the world’s most valuable network, the platform supports the deployment of smart contracts. For clarity, Fantom’s network was not hacked; the foundation’s wallets were compromised.
According to CertiK, the Fantom Foundation lost $470,000 on Fantom and at least $187,000 on Ethereum. Following the attack, Etherscan data show that the scammers consolidated funds into one account, holding at least $7 million of various coins. The address has already been marked and identified as a facilitator of multiple phishing campaigns impacting crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. 
Reports on Reddit show that Fantom Foundation fell victim to a “zero day” exploit on Chrome, a web browser, resulting in the loss of hundreds of thousands worth of FTM. In a screenshot of a Telegram conversation said to have been shared by a Fantom admin, the foundation acknowledged that “some” of their wallets were “drained.” They are actively tracking the movement of stolen funds. 
 A zero-day exploit is a vulnerability unknown to the developer or its tech team, who might be able to fix it. Because the flaw isn’t known to the team, the threat actor can exploit it until it is patched. This is why zero-day exploits can be consequential, especially for DeFi protocols whose infrastructure relies on flawed software. 
In the same screenshot shared on Reddit, a representative of Fantom Foundation said they didn’t update their browser to the latest version. The latest Chrome browser update, version 118.0.5993.70, was released on October 11.
Following this news, FTM fell roughly 5% and is now rocking close to multi-month lows. If bears press on, the coin may drop below 2022 lows. 
As such, it will reverse all gains made in the first half of 2023. At this year’s peaks, FTM prices rose to as high as $0.65 in February 2023 before contracting to spot rates. The coin is trading at approximately $0.17 and under intense selling pressure.

Bitcoin Hits Historic 61 Trillion Difficulty, Hashrate Defies Odds Amidst 2023’s Steepest Climbs;"On October 16, 2023, Bitcoin’s difficulty impressively crossed the 61 trillion mark at block height 812,448, setting a fresh benchmark for the network. This ascent marked the fourth-largest rise in difficulty for the year. Yet, in the face of this increase, the hashrate has steadily and unflinchingly risen.
On the heels of a 6.47% leap on Monday, Bitcoin’s difficulty peaked at an unprecedented 61.03 trillion, signifying the year’s fourth most significant spike. Miners previously navigated two back-to-back hikes: a 5.48% rise on September 19, followed by a slight 0.35% nudge upward on October 3.
Yet, despite these challenges, the hashrate is approaching its zenith, closely mirroring the high seen on October 12, 2023. By Tuesday, October 17, post the 6.47% surge in difficulty, the hashrate gracefully sails at 444 exahash per second (EH/s).

About 42 mining coalitions are pouring their hashrate into the Bitcoin chain, with the top five being Foundry USA, Antpool, Viabtc, F2pool, and Binance Pool. Over the last three days, Foundry has taken the lead, contributing 133.25 EH/s or 30.15% of the overall network’s hashrate, while Antpool churned out 116.95 EH/s, constituting 26.46% of the collective hashrate.
Come October 29, 2023, the next anticipated shift in difficulty is set to roll out after over 1,800 blocks are discovered. Notably, block intervals have consistently fallen short of the typical ten-minute mark, ranging between 9 minutes and 13 seconds and 9 minutes and 37 seconds.
The current block times suggest (unless things change) that if the hashrate persists in its vigor and block durations linger below the ten-minute threshold, we might see another hike. Projections currently hint at a potential increase anywhere between 0.18% to 4.2%.
What do you think about Bitcoin’s latest difficulty increase? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.

Bitcoin Bears Still in Control- While This Move May Transform the Bullish Trajectory!;"The post Bitcoin Bears Still in Control- While This Move May Transform the Bullish Trajectory! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The bears have jumped into action as the markets remain consolidated for the third consecutive day. With the market cap sliding to $1.08 trillion, investors now look out for a bearish narrative coming into play. However, the bullish trajectory cannot be eliminated as the Bitcoin price has reached a crucial zone where a breakout could offer a lift above the bearish influence.
The flagship crypto, Bitcoin, has been surrounded by bearish predictions for a long time, regardless of the positive swings observed in the recent past. However, the token is heading to close the weekly trade on a bullish note. If this materializes, the much-needed breakout could occur, squashing the bearish activity for a long time ahead.
In the weekly time frame, the BTC price continues to flash bullish signals as the trend maintains an ascending order. After trading within a symmetrical triangle, the price is again closer to testing the upper resistance, intending to trigger a breakout. Moreover, the price is also residing over the crucial 200-day MA, which is holding the price amid bearish occurrences. The price is holding up better than expected and is also carried by bullish ETF news, regardless of whether it is real or fake. 
However, the bearish narrative can be nullified only when the Bitcoin (BTC) price records a weekly close above the top resistance. Otherwise, the long-term bears may register a massive win. Historically, pre-halving years have on average 6 green and 6 red months, and hence one can expect some more red months ahead if a rejection at the resistance occurs.

California Governor Gavin Newsom Signs Bill To Create Regulatory Framework for Digital Assets;"The governor of California has signed off on a bill that aims to create a new regulatory framework for digital assets.
Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed Assembly Bill 39, which establishes the Digital Financial Assets Law.
The legislation requires the state’s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to “create a robust regulatory framework, including licensure and enforcement authority, for certain crypto activities.”
The bill also gives the DFPI rulemaking authority over crypto regulation along with an 18-month implementation timeline for a framework.
Says Newsom,
“Ambiguity of certain terms and the scope of this bill will require further refinement in both the regulatory process and in statute to provide clarity to both consumers, regulators and businesses subject to this new licensure framework. 
It is essential that we strike the appropriate balance between protecting consumers from harm and fostering a responsible innovation and I look forward to working with the author to achieve this.”
Newsom signed an executive order in May of last year asking legislators to create a regulatory framework that encourages blockchain innovation while protecting consumers.
The governor said the order, which he noted builds on President Biden’s crypto-focused executive order, will help California leverage blockchain technology for the public good.

Crypto community debates if fake approval news can hurt Bitcoin ETF chances;"On Oct. 16, a false report published by major crypto-focused media outlet Cointelegraph sent shockwaves through the industry over its claim that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF).
In the wake of this news, BTC’s price surged to over $30,000, only to swiftly retreat to around $28,000 once the misinformation was exposed.
This incident has sparked a flurry of responses and discussions regarding its potential influence on the SEC’s forthcoming decision concerning the numerous spot Bitcoin ETF applications awaiting approval or rejection.
CryptoSlate has curated the reactions from major stakeholders in the community below.
Many of those who think the news has hurt the chances of an ETF approval argued that the regulator has consistently claimed that the market could be easily manipulated, citing the asset’s price movement in their claims.
Over the past decade, the SEC has declined the many spot BTC ETF applications it has received because the fund issuers failed to demonstrate sufficient measures to safeguard investors from market manipulation.
According to stakeholders like Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, the fake news gave the financial regulator more ammunition to deny a spot BTC ETF.
Cochran said:
“[Cointelegraph] massively just hurt the chances of real ETF approval… The SEC has literally been looking for any and every excuse to deny it and we just handed them even more ammo.”
This view was also shared by the editor-at-large for Kraken FX, Pete Rizzo, who said the event “sets back an etf by at least 6 months.”
“We aren’t getting that BTC Spot ETF anytime soon, at least not until 2024. One of the reasons the SEC hasn’t approved the ETFs is concerns about market manipulation -and then, this happens,” an X user, Victor commented.
However, some community members had a more bullish view of the event, arguing that the reaction that followed the news was evidence of how much the market anticipates approval.
In an Oct. 16 interview with Fox Business, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the market reaction was “an example of the pent-up interest in crypto” and evidence of a “flight to quality.”
Jeff Dorman, the chief investment officer at Arca, a crypto-focused investment management firm, had a more nuanced view. According to him, the SEC cannot cite a “rogue media outlet” report as evidence of market manipulation.
Dorman gave the example of how a false report claiming the White House was attacked in 2013 caused hundreds of billions of losses in equities and debt.
“It doesn’t matter what asset class you are trading; erroneous headlines create whipsaw price action,” He concluded.

On Oct. 16, a false report published by major crypto-focused media outlet Cointelegraph sent shockwaves through the industry over its claim that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF).
In the wake of this news, BTC’s price surged to over $30,000, only to swiftly retreat to around $28,000 once the misinformation was exposed.
This incident has sparked a flurry of responses and discussions regarding its potential influence on the SEC’s forthcoming decision concerning the numerous spot Bitcoin ETF applications awaiting approval or rejection.
CryptoSlate has curated the reactions from major stakeholders in the community below.
Many of those who think the news has hurt the chances of an ETF approval argued that the regulator has consistently claimed that the market could be easily manipulated, citing the asset’s price movement in their claims.
Over the past decade, the SEC has declined the many spot BTC ETF applications it has received because the fund issuers failed to demonstrate sufficient measures to safeguard investors from market manipulation.
According to stakeholders like Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, the fake news gave the financial regulator more ammunition to deny a spot BTC ETF.
Cochran said:
“[Cointelegraph] massively just hurt the chances of real ETF approval… The SEC has literally been looking for any and every excuse to deny it and we just handed them even more ammo.”
This view was also shared by the editor-at-large for Kraken FX, Pete Rizzo, who said the event “sets back an etf by at least 6 months.”
“We aren’t getting that BTC Spot ETF anytime soon, at least not until 2024. One of the reasons the SEC hasn’t approved the ETFs is concerns about market manipulation -and then, this happens,” an X user, Victor commented.
However, some community members had a more bullish view of the event, arguing that the reaction that followed the news was evidence of how much the market anticipates approval.

Over 30,000 BTC Flows Out of Exchanges as Investors Prepare for Next Bitcoin Bull Run;"
In the midst of a turbulent global landscape and an unpredictable financial market, Bitcoin exchanges are now witnessing substantial outflows.
On Wednesday, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this development, tweeting that nearly 33,000 Bitcoins, worth around $924 million, were withdrawn from known cryptocurrency exchange wallets over the last five days, as per data from Cryptoquant.
Elsewhere, Bitstamp Exchange has witnessed its most significant outflow in over a year, with approximately 5,000 Bitcoins, equivalent to roughly $140 million, leaving the platform. Bitstamp’s holdings stand at about 40,000 Bitcoins, marking the lowest level since 2013.
Analysts have suggested that this movement to cold storage indicates that long-term holders are betting on a bullish future for Bitcoin. The substantial outflow has reduced the liquid supply of Bitcoin on exchanges, which could, in turn, drive the price higher.
Conversely, yesterday, on October 18, OKX Exchange saw its most substantial Bitcoin inflow in almost three years, with roughly 8,000 Bitcoins valued at approximately $224 million. OKX boasts a year-to-date high, holding approximately 143,000 Bitcoins, a level not seen since January 2021. The volatility in OKX’s flow highlights the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin exchanges and the contrasting strategies adopted by individual platforms amid ongoing market instability.
That said, some experts have argued that these contrasting observations are reminiscent of the conditions observed in November 2020 when the previous bull run commenced.
Meanwhile, analysts have been quite bullish in their predictions. They speculate that the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could come sooner than expected. Notably, a Wednesday report by Law360 stated that the SEC’s choice not to contest the reversal of its rejection of Grayscale Investments’ bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposal indicates a strong likelihood that the agency is gearing up for the approval of multiple ETFs involving bitcoin.
That said, an ETF approval is expected to profoundly impact the cryptocurrency market. According to a report by CryptoQuant, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could inject an estimated $1 trillion into the cryptocurrency market cap, potentially driving the cryptocurrency’s price to $73,000.
In light of these developments, Bitcoin has remained strong, maintaining its position above the $28,000 psychological support. The cryptocurrency was trading at $28,788 at press time, reflecting a 2% increase over the last 24 hours. Over the past week, BTC has surged by just over 7%.

Whistleblower Edward Snowden Issues Warning, Says Spot Bitcoin ETF a Form of Subjugation by TradFi;"Famed whistleblower Edward Snowden thinks the crypto community should be wary of a spot-based Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF).
While speaking at the Bitcoin Amsterdam 2023 event last week, the former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee warned about the potential dangers of letting traditional finance gain power over the top crypto asset.
“I think we need to remember that particularly in these moments of instability, that we are all part of a much bigger game, and Bitcoin is one of our strongest levers in that. 
The systems that we are influencing, that we are exerting leverage on – payments and finance – will shape what the world of tomorrow looks like. Now we have to cross some hurdles to get there in a meaningful way. 
Right now the reason everybody’s getting excited about the price is they’re thinking about ETFs or whatever. We don’t really want that to be the thing that moves price, even if price is moving. Because that is a kind of subordination, that is a kind of subjugation that is a process of taming that we see being played out.”
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed decisions on a slew of spot BTC ETF applications, including BlackRock’s, in late September.
The final deadline for the SEC to review one application, the ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF, is on January 10th.

BlackRock & JPMorgan To Fuel Next Bitcoin Bull Run, Says Forbes;"According to a recent Forbes report, BlackRock and JPMorgan will bring about the next bull run in crypto, particularly for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP. As per the report, all major cryptos will see “a huge BlackRock-led earthquake this month.” 
The report notes BTC’s price spike earlier this week due to fake reports about the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) approving BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). Moreover, Forbes also highlights that last week BlackRock became the first Wall Street firm to utilize JPMorgan’s blockchain-based collateral settlement system. According to BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, the move will help bring in “the next generation for markets.”

Since last year, Fink has become increasingly vocal about the importance of crypto. He had called the technology “very important” in his annual shareholder letter. He further added that “very interesting developments are happening in the digital asset space.”
Fink also predicts crypto to “transcend” traditional currencies. He stated, “Importantly, because it’s so international, going to transcend any one currency in currency valuation.”
The U.S. SEC has twice postponed its decision on BlackRock’s Spot BTC ETF. However, according to many experts, the SEC should approve the application by early next year. According to a former BlackRock director, the SEC would approve the application in three to six months, which falls within the timeframe of other forecasts. 
Also Read: JPMorgan Predicts Bitcoin Hash Rate to Fall 20% Post-Halving
Along with the Spot BTC ETF, Bitcoin will also undergo its fourth halving in April 2024. Halvings are usually considered to be bullish as they reduce the creation of new BTC coins. The halving, coupled with an approval for a spot BTC ETF, could spark a new bull run for the crypto market. many market experts anticipate major cryptos to reach new all-time highs, surpassing 2021 levels.

Grayscale Presents Fresh Registration to SEC Eyeing Bitcoin ETF Authorization;"Grayscale Investments has taken a proactive step by presenting a fresh registration document to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This move is driven by Grayscale’s commitment to morphing its established Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund). This ambition gained momentum after a directive from the D.C. Circuit Court instructed the SEC to revisit Grayscale’s proposal.
Notably, Grayscale opted for an S-3 filing, a concise version of the conventional S-1 filing. This is an important facet of their strategy to introduce new share offerings. Their eligibility for the S-3 filing is anchored in the fact that since January 2020, their shares have enjoyed registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This, combined with other stipulations, paved the way for the S-3 filing.
Grayscale isn’t the only titan in the financial arena pursuing the allure of spot bitcoin ETFs. Major players like BlackRock and Fidelity have also thrown their hats into the ring, seeking the green light from the SEC.
The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, represented by the ticker GBTC, plans to make its mark on NYSE Arca. The ultimate goal? To routinely issue shares post-approval from NYSE Arca and the subsequent activation of the S-3 form. This strategy is part of Grayscale’s overarching vision, as delineated in a recent statement.
A significant legal milestone is on the horizon. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is gearing up to release a directive, echoing its prior ruling from a few months back. Many view this as the concluding chapter in this regulatory saga. The lack of an appeal from the SEC last week has also fueled industry-wide hopes that a spot bitcoin ETF’s debut might be imminent. Nevertheless, several pieces still need to fall into place before this dream becomes a reality.
Grayscale’s tussle with the SEC began last year when the latter declined Grayscale’s proposition to transform its flagship GBTC fund into a spot bitcoin ETF. Demonstrating their tenacity, Grayscale penned a letter to the SEC a month ago, advocating for a dialogue about this conversion.
Gary Gensler, the SEC Chair, recently highlighted the considerable workload related to multiple filings the agency is navigating. He emphasized that Grayscale is one of many contenders. Commenting on the rigorous processes at the SEC, he elaborated that when asset managers aspire to go public, these entities need to engage in thorough SEC registration, akin to an IPO’s rigor.
He elaborated further on the robust, time-honored procedures within the SEC, particularly the roles of the Division of Corporation Finance and the Division of Trading and Markets.
The quest for a spot bitcoin ETF is gathering pace, with Grayscale leading the charge. As the regulatory landscape evolves and financial giants jostle for a slice of the pie, the market watches with bated breath. The current Bitcoin price is $28,500.

Crypto Giants Gemini, Genesis, DCG Face $1 Billion Lawsuit: New York’s Crackdown Begins?;"The New York Attorney General, Letitia James, has set her sights on three major players in the crypto space, alleging investor fraud. Genesis Global, its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and the renowned crypto platform Gemini find themselves in the crosshairs of a significant lawsuit. 
Attorney General James accuses them of deceptive practices that have allegedly duped investors out of more than a billion dollars. But what led to such allegations against these crypto giants?
Central to the lawsuit is the “Gemini Earn” program, a collaborative initiative between Gemini and Genesis. This program allowed users to lend their cryptocurrency assets, including Bitcoin, to Genesis. 
Gemini, co-founded by the Winklevoss twins – known for their contentious legal spat with Meta Platforms’ CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, according to Reuters, – marketed this initiative as a “low-risk investment.” However, the New York Attorney General’s investigation suggests otherwise. 
Despite Gemini’s confident portrayal of the program, James claims that internal analyses within the company had identified Genesis as being on shaky financial ground. Notably, such revelations would naturally conflict with their “low-risk” investment advertisement, potentially misleading countless investors.
Further deepening the intrigue, Attorney General James highlighted concerns regarding the security of Genesis’ loans. Specifically, they were undersecured, and a significant portion was heavily concentrated with one entity: the crypto hedge fund Alameda, spearheaded by Sam Bankman-Fried. 
This hedge fund unfortunately met its demise, further exacerbating the risks and potentially endangering investors’ assets. According to the report, in a move to address these allegations, Gemini share their perspective acknowledging the lawsuit and stated it “confirms what we’ve been saying all along”. 
However, they further expressed disagreement with the decision to include Gemini in the lawsuit.
Even amid legal scrutiny, Gemini continues to evolve its offerings. Recently, the exchange expanded its crypto suite by integrating XRP. As of August, users have been able to deposit XRP tokens into their Gemini accounts.
As reported by Bitcoinist, the platform allows trading of XRP through various avenues, including its API/FIX and ActiveTrader applications for USD trading pairs. Additionally, both the Gemini Mobile App and website have been updated to support XRP trading pairs in multiple currencies: USD, GBP, EUR, CAD, SGD, HKD, and AUD.
Notably, this update came not long after the recent victory achieved by Ripple Labs in the court battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Time To Cash Out? Bitcoin’s 4-Hour RSI Triggers Sell Indicator;"Bitcoin (BTC) has retraced to the $28,400 level following a failed breakout above $30,000, resulting in a high rate of liquidations for both long and short positions. 
Additionally, the recent fake news surrounding the approval of Blackrock’s spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission has disrupted the upward trend and introduced new bearish indicators in the Bitcoin market.
Renowned trader and crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests selling BTC based on its 4-hour chart Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. His simple trading strategy advises selling BTC when the RSI exceeds 74.21 and buying when the RSI dips below 30.35.
As seen in the chart above, BTC’s RSI stands at the 74 level, which is notably high considering that on October 16, after the spread of the fake news on various platforms, including X (Formerly Twitter), the RSI reached as high as 82.83.
While this indicator may seem straightforward, it has proven effective on BTC’s 4-hour chart. For instance, on October 1st, Bitcoin peaked at $28,500, but after the RSI climbed above 80, the leading cryptocurrency swiftly dropped to $27,150 within hours.
Although the effectiveness of these indicators is not always guaranteed, the combination of the recent false pump, the ongoing retrace evident in all BTC charts, the lack of bullish momentum, and the prevailing market sentiment of fear, doubt, and uncertainty could create the perfect storm for BTC to retest lower support levels before potentially embarking on another upward movement.
To further support Ali Martinez’s bearish thesis, renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently shed light on Bitcoin’s historical retracements approximately 180 days before halving events. 
According to Rekt, in 2015/2016, approximately 180 days before the halving, Bitcoin experienced a retracement of -25%. Similarly, in 2019, around the same timeframe before the halving, Bitcoin retraced by -38%. 
While Rekt Capital identifies as a macro bull, he acknowledges that historical data favors bearish trends before halving events. 
This observation raises the question of whether history will repeat itself in 2023. Will Bitcoin witness a significant retracement similar to previous cycles, or will the market dynamics 2023 deviate from historical patterns?
What is certain is that as the crypto community eagerly anticipates the 2023 halving, uncertainty looms regarding Bitcoin’s price behavior leading up to the event.
As of the current market conditions, BTC is trading at $28,400, indicating a profitable position across all time frames. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has experienced a modest increase of 1%.
Over the seven, fourteen, and thirty-day periods, BTC has recorded profits of 3.7%, 4%, and 7%, respectively, despite the earlier bearish factors. The sustainability of Bitcoin’s current price level remains uncertain, as it remains to be seen whether it will withstand potential retracements soon.

Doctor caught red-handed: How the FBI cracked a Bitcoin murder plot;"Dr. James Wan, a Georgia-based physician, pled guilty to charges of orchestrating a murder-for-hire plot via the dark web. Using Bitcoin to conduct transactions, Wan believed he was operating under the shield of anonymity that the cryptocurrency often provides. This grim plot aimed to assassinate his girlfriend through a contrived carjacking scenario. However, the operation unraveled before any harm could be done, thanks to vigilant law enforcement agencies.
The U.S. Department of Justice disclosed that Wan’s venture into the dark web commenced in April 2022. He meticulously gathered details, from his girlfriend’s social media information to specifics about her vehicle. Moreover, to seal the deal, Wan pledged multiple Bitcoin payments totaling approximately $24,200.
Initially, Dr. Wan transferred a 50% down payment, equivalent to around $8,000 in Bitcoin, to an escrow wallet. Unfortunately for him, the transaction faltered as the funds reached an incorrect address. Undeterred, he transferred another $8,000 a week later to ensure the operation’s continuation. Additionally, Wan became restless, probing the marketplace’s forum with questions about the timeline and progress of his grim request.
Although he thought he was taking all the necessary steps for a faultless plan, his endeavor faced a crucial obstacle. His inquiries and transactions did not go unnoticed. Keri Farley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta, lauded the exceptional work of her team in averting this heinous plot, ensuring that Wan would face the repercussions under the full might of the criminal justice system.
According to federal authorities, Dr. Wan is not an isolated case in attempting to leverage Bitcoin for criminal activities. Last year, the FBI charged a Utah man who shelled out $16,000 in Bitcoin to hire a hitman for a double murder. Additionally, a Nevada woman received a 5-year prison sentence for a similar plot involving her ex-husband. It seems that the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin is attracting a nefarious clientele, believing it provides a sanctuary from detection and prosecution.
While Wan’s case exposes the dark corners of the web and cryptocurrency, it also serves as a potent reminder. The promise of anonymity in the digital sphere is not infallible. Law enforcement agencies are increasingly adapting and improving their methods for tracking these underhanded operations. Consequently, those who think they can evade justice by merely transacting in Bitcoin are in for a harsh reality check. Dr. Wan is now awaiting sentencing, scheduled for January 2024, where he will face the penalties for his would-be crime.

Dr. James Wan, a Georgia-based physician, pled guilty to charges of orchestrating a murder-for-hire plot via the dark web. Using Bitcoin to conduct transactions, Wan believed he was operating under the shield of anonymity that the cryptocurrency often provides. This grim plot aimed to assassinate his girlfriend through a contrived carjacking scenario. However, the operation unraveled before any harm could be done, thanks to vigilant law enforcement agencies.
The U.S. Department of Justice disclosed that Wan’s venture into the dark web commenced in April 2022. He meticulously gathered details, from his girlfriend’s social media information to specifics about her vehicle. Moreover, to seal the deal, Wan pledged multiple Bitcoin payments totaling approximately $24,200.
Initially, Dr. Wan transferred a 50% down payment, equivalent to around $8,000 in Bitcoin, to an escrow wallet. Unfortunately for him, the transaction faltered as the funds reached an incorrect address. Undeterred, he transferred another $8,000 a week later to ensure the operation’s continuation. Additionally, Wan became restless, probing the marketplace’s forum with questions about the timeline and progress of his grim request.
Although he thought he was taking all the necessary steps for a faultless plan, his endeavor faced a crucial obstacle. His inquiries and transactions did not go unnoticed. Keri Farley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta, lauded the exceptional work of her team in averting this heinous plot, ensuring that Wan would face the repercussions under the full might of the criminal justice system.
According to federal authorities, Dr. Wan is not an isolated case in attempting to leverage Bitcoin for criminal activities. Last year, the FBI charged a Utah man who shelled out $16,000 in Bitcoin to hire a hitman for a double murder. Additionally, a Nevada woman received a 5-year prison sentence for a similar plot involving her ex-husband. It seems that the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin is attracting a nefarious clientele, believing it provides a sanctuary from detection and prosecution.
While Wan’s case exposes the dark corners of the web and cryptocurrency, it also serves as a potent reminder. The promise of anonymity in the digital sphere is not infallible. Law enforcement agencies are increasingly adapting and improving their methods for tracking these underhanded operations. Consequently, those who think they can evade justice by merely transacting in Bitcoin are in for a harsh reality check. Dr. Wan is now awaiting sentencing, scheduled for January 2024, where he will face the penalties for his would-be crime.

Ethereum Price Faces Crucial Test: Will $1,570 Withstand the Pressure?;"Ethereum price started a steady increase from the $1,520 zone against the US dollar. ETH is now struggling to clear the $1,605 and $1,620 resistance levels.
Ethereum started a fresh increase from the $1,520 level. ETH gained traction like Bitcoin and spiked above the $1,600 resistance level. It even climbed above $1,620, but the bears appeared near $1,650.
A high was formed near $1,669 before there was a fresh decline. Ether trimmed gains and settled below the $1,600 level. It tested the $1,575 support and is currently consolidating near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,574 low.
Ethereum is now trading just above $1,575 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,572 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.
On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,605 level. The first major resistance is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,574 low at $1,620. A close above the $1,620 resistance might start a decent increase.

Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com
In the stated case, Ether could rise and recover toward the $1,665 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750.
If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,605 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,575 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
The next key support is $1,550. A downside break below the $1,550 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,520 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,440 level.
Technical Indicators
Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.
Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.
Major Support Level – $1,575
Major Resistance Level – $1,620

Shiba Inu Price Could Reach $1 in the Next 6 Months: Here’s What Needs to Happen;"The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility and unpredictability, with tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) often at the center of speculative trading and massive price swings. Recently, a significant transaction of 4,587,030,677,374 SHIB, worth approximately $32,409,665, was transferred from an unknown wallet to another. This article will explore the implications of such a move and the conditions required for Shiba Inu Price to reach the elusive $1 mark within the next six months.
 As of now, SHIB is trading at $0.000007084. With a circulating supply of 394,796 billion SHIB, the market capitalization stands at approximately $2.8 billion.
For SHIB to reach $1, the market cap would need to be around $394.796 trillion, given the current circulating supply. This is a significant leap from its current state and would require a price increase of approximately 14,099,430% in just six months.
In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, large transactions often catch the attention of enthusiasts and analysts alike. Recently, a colossal transfer involving the popular meme coin, Shiba Inu ($SHIB), has made waves in the crypto community.
The recent transfer of 4,587,030,677,374 SHIB has stirred the market. Such large transactions can indicate a potential major move in the market, either by a single entity accumulating SHIB or preparing for a significant sell-off. The implications of this transaction can vary:
Such a massive movement of tokens can have various implications:
Shiba Inu, often referred to as the “Dogecoin killer,” has gained immense popularity in recent times. Born as a meme coin, its community-driven approach and the potential for high returns have attracted many investors. This transfer is a testament to the significant amounts of money that are now involved in the SHIB ecosystem.
While the identities of the wallets remain unknown, the transfer underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. As always, investors and enthusiasts are advised to do their research and stay informed about market trends. Large transfers like this serve as a reminder of the vast sums of money flowing through the crypto world daily.
While the $1 target is ambitious, several factors could potentially contribute to such a rally:
While the prospect of SHIB reaching $1 in the next six months is highly speculative and comes with immense challenges, the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market makes it unwise to rule out any possibilities. Investors should keep a close eye on market trends, regulatory developments, and the SHIB community’s momentum. As always, caution and due diligence are advised in the highly speculative and volatile cryptocurrency market.

For the first time in two years, GBTC discount to NAV drops below 15%;"The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) fund ended the day yesterday, Oct. 16, up 7.7%. The substantial rise took GBTC’s year-to-date gains to a striking 166%. However, concurrently, the discount to Net Asset Value (NAV) has declined below 15% for the first time in the past two years, now standing at 14.77%, according to Y charts.
The current price action appears to be a reflection of investor sentiment regarding potential future developments. There is rising speculation that the GBTC fund could transform into a spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). This notable shift in market sentiment may be driving the increased activity in GBTC as investors position themselves in anticipation of a possible transition.
As the possibility of a spot ETF becomes increasingly plausible, financial markets may witness further volatility within the digital asset class.

Here’s the Most Likely Scenario for XRP in the Coming Days (Crash Incoming?): Ripple Price Analysis;"The price of Ripple is currently showing concerning signs on both the USDT and BTC paired charts. It might be the case that the value of XRP will decrease in the coming weeks in terms of both the US dollar and Bitcoin, but there might also be more to the story.
By Edris
Against USDT, the price has recently been bullish, with several consecutive green daily candles. However, the price was rejected by the 50-day moving average, which is around the $0.5 mark and is currently preventing it from rallying higher.
If the market fails to break above this level, it is likely that the price will drop to $0.43. Conversely, if XRP breaks above the 50-day moving average, it could result in a rally towards the key $0.55 resistance zone and potentially even higher.
Against BTC, the chart presents an even worse situation for XRP. The price has recently broken below the 1800 SAT support level and does not seem likely to bounce back soon.
The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are also indicating a bearish crossover near the 1900 SAT level, suggesting the beginning of a potential downtrend. The RSI indicator is also showing values below 50%, indicating that the momentum favors the bears and the price is likely to drop towards the 1600 SAT area in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin Spark and Monero (XMR): A Closer Look Into These Exciting Projects;"With cryptocurrency gaining significant traction worldwide, enthusiasts suggest you can enjoy the best retirement plan by investing in Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) and Monero (XMR).
Monero (XMR) is a blockchain that prioritizes privacy and security, designed to ensure that transaction details such as sender addresses, recipient addresses, and transaction amounts remain confidential. This is achieved through advanced cryptographic techniques, including ring signatures, confidential transactions, and stealth addresses.
Monero’s commitment to privacy has made it a popular choice for individuals seeking financial confidentiality and security in their transactions, making it one of the leading cryptocurrencies in the privacy-focused digital currency market. Investors often consider Monero (XMR) part of a diversified investment strategy, aiming to benefit from its unique features and potential for long-term growth.
Bitcoin Spark is an innovative blockchain that seeks to introduce a new era of digital transactions. This blockchain boasts fast transaction processing and low gas fees, achieved by a low block time, high transaction capacity per block, and a large number of nodes.
Beyond its speed and cost efficiency, Bitcoin Spark also offers a robust platform for creating and utilizing smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). The blockchain has a multi-layered infrastructure that includes a smart contract layer with various execution systems, all converging on the main network. This ensures scalability and provides developers with a wide selection of high-level and low-level programming languages to work with.
What truly sets Bitcoin Spark apart is its groundbreaking Proof-of-Process (PoP) consensus mechanism, which combines elements of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Users are required to contribute processing power in order to validate blocks and earn rewards, with diminishing rewards per additional power.
The non-linear reward system, combined with the extensive node network, ensures an inclusive environment that accommodates even low-powered devices. The Bitcoin Spark team will even launch a user-friendly network validation application compatible with Windows, iOS, Android, Mac OS, and Linux devices.

Bitcoin Spark introduces the concept of decentralized CPU and GPU rental through its innovative consensus mechanism. It leases the contributed power to clients for remote computing, who, in turn, pay for the service in BTCS tokens. Remarkably, network validators receive 97% of the revenue generated from CPU/GPU rental, in addition to newly minted BTCS tokens and transaction fees from confirmed blocks.
Furthermore, the Bitcoin Spark app and website will feature small ad spaces, which the community will monitor for security. Advertisers will be required to pay in BTCS, and 50% of the ad revenue, along with extra incentives for ad monitoring, will be distributed among network participants.
The Bitcoin Spark network has passed multiple smart contract audits, verifying its security and sustainability.
Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) presents an opportunity on several other fronts aside from the potential returns from network participation.
With a capped supply of 21 million BTCS tokens, mirroring the model that has driven Bitcoin’s long-term price increases, it holds the potential to become a valuable asset over time. Beyond this, Bitcoin Spark’s practical applications and innovative technology are expected to attract many users, thereby increasing demand. Additionally, Bitcoin Spark is in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) stage, providing an opportunity to get BTCS at discounted prices. BTCS will launch at $10 but is currently priced at $3.00 in Phase 7 of the ICO, with investors getting a 7% bonus and other benefits.
As the world of finance continues to evolve, it’s essential to consider innovative options for retirement planning. Bitcoin Spark and Monero offer distinctive features that can diversify your investment portfolio. Nonetheless, it’s essential to do your own research before investing.

Coinbase rolls out perpetual futures trading outside U.S>;"The digital currency marketplace just got a bit more intricate. Coinbase, a significant player in the crypto world, is stepping its game up, venturing into the realm of perpetual futures trading on a global scale, excluding the United States. 
With this bold move, the company aims to leverage the power of derivatives, capturing a slice of the growing demand that has taken the crypto industry by storm.
Coinbase Advanced has launched its new service, enabling traders from specific jurisdictions outside the U.S. to dive into perpetual futures trading. 
Here’s the lowdown: eager investors can employ the USDC coin to place their stakes on contracts across four cryptocurrencies, namely bitcoin, ether, litecoin, and XRP. While most contracts on the platform provide up to 5X leverage, the XRP is an exception, allowing a maximum of 3X leverage.
For now, this trading model remains tethered to the Coinbase Advanced webpage. However, whispers from the inside suggest that the days are numbered before Coinbase unveils a mobile trading feature, making the platform even more accessible to tech-savvy traders worldwide.
The initiation of this service wasn’t just a spur-of-the-moment decision. It was a calculated move, mapped out in the wake of Coinbase International Exchange obtaining a nod of approval from the Bermuda Monetary Authority. 
This authorization granted them the latitude to provide perpetual futures to their expansive clientele outside the American borders. If one were to scrutinize the data, they’d quickly discern the colossal impact derivatives have on the crypto ecosystem. 
March 2023 statistics paint a staggering picture, revealing that derivatives account for nearly three-quarters of the entire cryptocurrency’s trading volume, which floats around a whopping $2.95 trillion, as per a CoinGecko survey.
To throw in more figures for perspective, just a couple of days ago, on October 16, the global centralized exchange perpetuals volume skyrocketed to an eye-watering $151 billion. 
It’s worth noting that Coinbase’s arch-nemesis, Binance, hogged a lion’s share of this volume, seizing roughly $96.3 billion, which translates to an enviable 63.7% of the pie. 
Following closely, though still a considerable distance behind, was OKX, clutching onto a respectable 16% of this market. Coinbase’s blog post shed light on this endeavor, underscoring the immense demand for these perpetual futures products. 
The blog mentioned the increased capital efficiency that trading on margin offers. It’s a tempting prospect, allowing traders to tap into the crypto market without a hefty initial investment. 
Moreover, the duality of going long and short grants traders the luxury to judiciously manage risks associated with their core crypto assets.
Coinbase’s latest maneuver in the global crypto chess game is a testament to its ambitions. However, only time will dictate the fruitfulness of this endeavor. 
As the crypto market continues to mature, evolve, and occasionally convulse, companies like Coinbase must remain agile, navigating these choppy waters with calculated risks, foresight, and a touch of audacity. 
And while this particular initiative looks promising, one can only speculate on its eventual outcome in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

With this bold move, the company aims to leverage the power of derivatives, capturing a slice of the growing demand that has taken the crypto industry by storm.
Coinbase Advanced has launched its new service, enabling traders from specific jurisdictions outside the U.S. to dive into perpetual futures trading. 
Here’s the lowdown: eager investors can employ the USDC coin to place their stakes on contracts across four cryptocurrencies, namely bitcoin, ether, litecoin, and XRP. While most contracts on the platform provide up to 5X leverage, the XRP is an exception, allowing a maximum of 3X leverage.
For now, this trading model remains tethered to the Coinbase Advanced webpage. However, whispers from the inside suggest that the days are numbered before Coinbase unveils a mobile trading feature, making the platform even more accessible to tech-savvy traders worldwide.
The initiation of this service wasn’t just a spur-of-the-moment decision. It was a calculated move, mapped out in the wake of Coinbase International Exchange obtaining a nod of approval from the Bermuda Monetary Authority. 
This authorization granted them the latitude to provide perpetual futures to their expansive clientele outside the American borders. If one were to scrutinize the data, they’d quickly discern the colossal impact derivatives have on the crypto ecosystem. 
March 2023 statistics paint a staggering picture, revealing that derivatives account for nearly three-quarters of the entire cryptocurrency’s trading volume, which floats around a whopping $2.95 trillion, as per a CoinGecko survey.
To throw in more figures for perspective, just a couple of days ago, on October 16, the global centralized exchange perpetuals volume skyrocketed to an eye-watering $151 billion. 
It’s worth noting that Coinbase’s arch-nemesis, Binance, hogged a lion’s share of this volume, seizing roughly $96.3 billion, which translates to an enviable 63.7% of the pie. 
Following closely, though still a considerable distance behind, was OKX, clutching onto a respectable 16% of this market. Coinbase’s blog post shed light on this endeavor, underscoring the immense demand for these perpetual futures products. 
The blog mentioned the increased capital efficiency that trading on margin offers. It’s a tempting prospect, allowing traders to tap into the crypto market without a hefty initial investment. 
Moreover, the duality of going long and short grants traders the luxury to judiciously manage risks associated with their core crypto assets.
Coinbase’s latest maneuver in the global crypto chess game is a testament to its ambitions. However, only time will dictate the fruitfulness of this endeavor. 
As the crypto market continues to mature, evolve, and occasionally convulse, companies like Coinbase must remain agile, navigating these choppy waters with calculated risks, foresight, and a touch of audacity. 
And while this particular initiative looks promising, one can only speculate on its eventual outcome in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

JPMorgan Expects SEC Approval of Multiple Spot Bitcoin ETF’s Within Months;"According to analysts at JPMorgan, the SEC will likely approve several spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the coming months.
In a report on Wednesday, JPMorgan stated spot bitcoin ETF approvals should materialize before January 10, 2024, which is the deadline for certain filings like ARK Invest’s application.

JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said, “This is the earliest among the various final deadlines faced by SEC across spot bitcoin ETF applications.”
JUST IN: JP Morgan expects the SEC to approve multiple Spot #Bitcoin ETF's within months.
The bank cited growing optimism around multiple approvals following the SEC’s inaction on appealing Grayscale’s win. The decision required the agency to reexamine a spot bitcoin ETF. JPMorgan believes approvals are now more likely.
Per the analysts, Grayscale’s popular bitcoin fund, GBTC, would face fee pressure. On the other hand, it may also see its trading discount versus net asset value disappear as an ETF.

JPMorgan expects the SEC to approve ETFs from various applicants simultaneously to encourage fee competition.
While the precise timing is still uncertain, the tone from major financial institutions indicates confidence is rising on long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF approvals materializing in 2023 after years of setbacks.

Bitcoin ETF Decision Nears: January 10th Marks Crucial Date for ARK $BTC Spot ETF Approval;"The post Bitcoin ETF Decision Nears: January 10th Marks Crucial Date for ARK $BTC Spot ETF Approval appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The SEC has again pushed back the approval of Spot Bitcoin applications for industry giants such as BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, ARK Investment Management, VanEck, and more. Now, everyone’s got their eyes on the third deadline, and there’s a big one on January 10th as the final deadline for ARK Investment Management.
On October 17th, a false report suggested that the U.S. SEC had approved BlackRock for a spot Bitcoin ETF. This news triggered a rapid surge in Bitcoin prices, driving them to reach as high as $30,106, marking a notable 10% increase.
Further, a BlackRock spokesperson, in response to the incident, informed MarketWatch that their iShares Bitcoin ETF application is “still under review by the SEC,” indicating that it had not yet received the official go-ahead.
Earlier, the SEC said yes to Bitcoin futures ETFs, which is a good sign.  This ETF has not been approved, but January 10th is when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may provide the verdict that could change the crypto landscape.
#Bitcoin The 10th of January is going to be the date to look out for as this marks the final deadline for the ARK $BTC Spot ETF.I would assume that we'd see a decision made before that date though.The consensus also seems to be that all ETFs are decided on at the same time. pic.twitter.com/CFuaco7fY2
This is the deadline for the SEC to respond to the spot Bitcoin ETF application submitted by ARK Invest and 21Shares. Many analysts believe there’s a 90% chance of approval by Ark’s January 10th deadline. It could be a big deal if the ARK Bitcoin ETF gets approved.
Additionally, the SEC reviews applications from BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, Wisdomtree, VanEck, and more. These applications face an extended deadline of March 15 of the following year.
Now, all eyes are on January 10th, which could potentially mark a significant milestone in cryptocurrency.

The Best Path to Web3 Mass Adoption Is Where Blockchain Is Critical, But Invisible;" 
With any new technology, there is a familiar pattern of adoption for those innovations that eventually become part of daily life.  This pattern is called Roger’s Innovation Adoption Curve.  The premise is that a new technology, even the most exciting, mass adoption does not happen right away.  Instead, there are a series of adoption steps that take place from different groups of people.  The Innovators, making up just 2.5% of people, are those helping to develop and expand the early technology.  They see the big picture and have the technical knowledge to either make it a reality or find new use cases.  The next group is the Early Adopters, which is 13.5%.  These people are typically technically capable as well; they can also see the big picture and are not afraid to put in the time, effort, and troubleshooting to explore early use cases.  Many of these people become thought leaders, bridging the gap between the current buggy (or at least imperfect) design and what it will evolve into.  In the world of Web3, this is where we are.  The many different platforms available have evolved dramatically in just a few years, becoming easier to use; the value of Web3 is becoming understood by more and more people thanks to thought leaders and a wider array of use cases.  However, for many platforms there is still a minimum technical requirement for users.  They have to create and connect wallets, they sometimes have to refer to the whitepaper or Docs, and they have to overcome the biggest adoption barrier of all:  they sometimes have to troubleshoot.
To get to what we call “mass adoption”, this technical ability threshold needs to drop to nearly zero.  The next two adoption groups are called the Early Majority and Late Majority, each representing a whopping 34% of the population who will eventually use the new technology.  The Laggards round out the last 16% but we typically don’t focus much there—picture your weird uncle who still boasts a flip phone (not the new kind).  When a technology breaks into the majority groups, this is when “mass adoption” begins.  Web3 feels closer and closer by the day, but the technology also carries with it the baggage of the last 3-5 years.  For those not involved in Web3, they may associate it solely with Bitcoin mining, the person who lost all their money crypto trading (with zero understanding of the system), or pixelated animal NFTs.
To break through the barriers, Web3 as an industry must accomplish several key goals to convince the majority that the technology is not only beneficial, but inevitable.  First, to get past the Web3 bias, it must act as a transparent layer for users.  Second, Web3 must bring critical value to the platform.  Finally, the Web3 component should offer a unique solution that is impossible using Web2 or other solutions; and the solution should be for something that is a real problem for many different people.  Crypto trading is useful, but has a notoriously high learning curve.  Digital art NFTs were interesting, but didn’t solve a real societal problem.  And some Web3 platforms do offer a solution to a widespread problem, but there are Web2 solutions that can also solve it.  Let’s dive in deeper to each of these conditions, identifying how to meet them and to find a key use case, online event ticketing, that can only be solved with key Web3 attributes.
This attribute has been evolving on numerous Web3 fronts.  There are more platforms that are working hard to keep Web3 terms in the background to avoid customer confusion.  Perhaps the most successful use of transparency is using mental models and terms that non-technical customers are already familiar with.  For example, instead of asking a user to connect their Web3 wallet, which would create many different questions and result in quitting, a platform might assume that many customers don’t have pre-existing wallets as they’ve never interacted with Web3.  Instead, a platform might ask a user to “create an account”, of which part of the process is to automatically create the wallet for the user, tie it to their account, and use the wallet for that platform.  In many ways, this is no different than an account you might have for a retail website where your payment information is stored (hopefully securely).  
In terms of using tokens, there are several best practices being used.  A platform might allow a user to use straight fiat with the tokens as an option, or use fiat to convert into usable tokens.  This model has been used in video game arcades for decades, and can be explained as such.  For token rewards, although they might be a digital financial asset, they can act the way any “point system” might work on a Web2 site.  You earn points (tokens) for doing certain things, and you can then redeem them for various rewards.  This concept is familiar to those of any age, so long as you don’t try to explain what an ERC-20 standard is.
For criticality, a Web3 platform must integrate the Web3 features into the core of its value proposition.  It can’t simply be a bonus rewards system.  It needs to leverage those elements of Web3 that can’t be used elsewhere.  Transparency.  Security.  Immutability.  The ability to verify something on chain, anywhere in the world.  These are essentially superpowers if used right.  Further, they must tackle those issues that simply can’t be solved by Web2.  If a trustless environment is critical because strangers are working together, a smart contract can be the perfect arbiter.  If you need to verify critical information that with a Web2 solution could be faked, Web3 is there for you.  If you require a form of currency that needs to smoothly cross borders across the world, token usage is a low fee, high efficiency solution.
As a key example of these elements coming together, we can look at the UTIX use case.  UTIX is an online e-ticketing platform that was built to solve widespread, universal problems among both event organizers (EOs) and fans.  Ticketmaster has reigned with a monopolistic, iron fist over the ticketing market for decades, which has made nearly everyone frustrated with the current state of the industry.  Instead of having users link to its Github, UTIX has followed the pattern described above.  It uses an Android/IOS app for both groups (EOs and customers) where the account creation is also a wallet creation for the UTIX Loyalty Token.  This token has a number of purposes, but from a user’s perspective it offers discounts, rewards, and exclusive opportunities like special tickets/events.  To ensure the process is seamless from a Web3 perspective, the platform has gained approval for the token certified as a Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) approved IVFAO.  The token is an ERC-20 standard virtual financial asset, which for the Web3 community will soon be listed on the Bitmart Exchange.  Even if the UTIX customers are unaware initially, this creates even more opportunities for the tokens they hold.  
The platform integrates key Web3 foundational aspects into its solution.  Two big problems with online ticketing are price gouging and fake tickets.  By making each ticket an NFT that the EO customizes (price range, when it’s available, whether or not it can be resold and for how much), UTIX has simply removed the ability for secondary market price gouging, unless the EO wants that to happen (and if they want the bad press to go along with it).  For fake tickets, a user about to buy a ticket can simply take the QR code and verify its authenticity on-chain, transparently through the app, and all before they decide to purchase.  If ever there was a problem custom made for Web3, this is it.
We will continue to look for these pioneering use cases that target the early and late majority of Web3 adopters.  By making Web3 elements invisible but critical, and by solving those major problems currently impossible using Web2, adoption just might snowball into an avalanche of enthusiasts.

Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin Says He Hasn’t Sold ETH for Personal Gain Since 2018;"Ethereum (ETH) creator Vitalik Buterin says he hasn’t sold ETH for personal gain since 2018.
Buterin notes on the decentralized social media network Warpcast that people should be wary of news articles reporting on his ETH moves.
“If you see an article saying ‘Vitalik sends XXX ETH to [exchange],’ it’s not actually me selling, it’s almost always me donating to some charity or nonprofit or other project, and the recipient selling because, well, they have to cover expenses.”
A wallet owned by Buterin shifted 600 ETH worth over $1 million to top US crypto exchange Coinbase in August, according to Ethereum blockchain tracker Etherscan.
In March, Buterin moved 200 ETH worth over $323,000 to a wallet of unknown origin, according to Blockchain security firm Peckshield. The ETH trove was subsequently transferred to the crypto exchange Kraken, where it could potentially be sold on the open market.
The security firm also reported that the Ethereum founder sent 500 ETH to stablecoin-focused decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Reflexer earlier that month. Reflexer is a platform designed to enable users to mint stablecoins by using their crypto as collateral.
Buterin used the 500 ETH as collateral to accumulate stablecoins to the tune of 378,500 USD Coin (USDC) and 50,000 Dai (DAI).
ETH is trading at $1,574 at time of writing.

An Open Letter To Apple: Tim Cook Can Revive Apples Legacy With Bitcoin 180;"Apple, you gained the world’s largest market capitalization because you dared think differently. So when you decided to shut down zaps on Damus it came as a shock to someone who always appreciated Apple’s rebel spirit. Removing zaps from the iOS store does not stop me from zapping. It just makes me zap in a web browser instead. Reconsider what zaps can do for your business so you don’t miss the forest for the trees.
Bitcoin’s underlying technology cannot be uninvented. It is a revolutionary concept destined to endure as long as society requires money and individuals are driven by self-interest. Bitcoin’s invention has birthed a decentralized network poised to redefine the very fabric of human organization, ushering in transformations previously unimaginable. Many people could never have imagined giving up their phone for an iPhone, until they saw an iPhone. In many ways Bitcoin is similar for money. What Satoshi created was absolute scarcity that anyone can verify for themselves. In Satoshi and Steve we find visionaries who transformed the unattainable into reality, rewriting the narrative of human achievement.
Bitcoin transcends mere currency creation. If it becomes widely adopted as a foundational layer of global finance, Bitcoin could fundamentally transform the role and function of governments, similar to how the internet disrupted and transformed businesses. As Jobs said, “A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” Great thinkers reject the status quo. If Satoshi Nakamoto believed in traditional fiat edicts and “too big to fail” institutions Bitcoin would not exist.
Like cash and digital payments, Bitcoin has its own set of trade-offs. Cash offers superior privacy and allows for peer-to-peer payments, but it cannot be sent over the internet. Credit cards and bank accounts enable convenient online payments, but they require users to give up personal information. Both are fiat currencies which means they are subject to inflation risks. Bitcoin offers the promise of secure online money transfers without the need for banks or intermediaries, but it requires users to understand its unique features and take responsibility for their finances. If you don’t run a node, you introduce counterparty risk, the very thing Bitcoin was designed to solve. The delicate balance between convenience and control is a personal choice. Nonetheless, I firmly believe that the cross-disciplinary design principles that propelled Apple to greatness could contribute significantly to resolving this tension between user-friendliness and autonomy within the realm of Bitcoin. Apple stands to gain substantially by offering well-crafted Bitcoin services and elevating the overall user experience.
Steve Jobs and Satoshi Nakamoto both embraced a first principles approach to innovation. Nakamoto’s pioneering work led to the creation of a decentralized system that blended elements of computer science, cryptography, and economics. It’s almost poetic that such a brilliant open system finds a home on Apple’s sleek machines. Jobs had a unique vision for Apple, one where control over both hardware and software was paramount to ensure the highest quality and user experience. While this approach sometimes frustrated others, it undeniably played a crucial role in propelling Apple to its current status in the world. However, innovation is an ever-evolving landscape, and there are moments when adopting groundbreaking technology becomes inevitable. Jobs’ commitment to control was unwavering, but even he acknowledged the need to embrace superior technology when it emerged. Steve Wozniak, Apple’s other co-founder, has aptly labeled Bitcoin a “mathematical miracle” and I see no reason why the other Steve would not have agreed. While Apple stands as a formidable force, Bitcoin operates as a straightforward protocol. Apple unquestionably stands to benefit from integrating Bitcoin into its ecosystem, but Bitcoin remains independent and resilient, free from reliance on any single entity, even an industry giant like Apple. There’s no doubt that Apple’s immediate survival does not hinge on embracing Bitcoin. However, complacency fosters stagnation, and over time, the company may face growing challenges if it neglects to harness the potential of Bitcoin.
While I appreciate Steve Jobs’ brilliance and his commitment to his vision, I believe that Satoshi Nakamoto’s community-centric approach was better suited for what he was creating. Bitcoin evolves through decentralized governance, where decisions about its development are made collectively by its global user base. This ensures that the digital currency remains adaptable and responsive to the needs and preferences of its users. It also makes it difficult for people to “move fast and break things” which can be disruptive and harmful in a financial system people all over the world are using as a store of value.
The strength and adaptability of Bitcoin owe much to the absence of a solitary central figure. It was not the brainchild of a lone individual; in fact, Satoshi cited the work of eight others in the original white paper. While Nakamoto launched the network, Bitcoin has since evolved through the contributions of many developers and community members. Without a solitary leader to target, Bitcoin has proven adaptable and resilient amid free market forces and waves of scrutiny. Though individuals come and go, transformative ideas can live on and change the world. As the film V for Vendetta noted, powerful principles can outlast any one person: ""We are told to remember the idea, not the man, because a man can fail. He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten, but 400 years later, an idea can still change the world."" Bitcoin's decentralized ethos embodies this spirit of an idea taking on a life of its own.
In contrast to Bitcoin's decentralized beginnings, Apple's success is largely attributed to the vision and leadership of one man. What made Steve Jobs so successful is how he seamlessly combined art, music, and creativity into products that people emotionally connected with. Steve was excellent at evoking people's emotion through thoughtful design and marketing. While Bitcoin and Apple took very different paths, they both demonstrate how a great idea, whether championed by one leader or many, can profoundly impact the world.
Innovation thrives at the crossroads of diverse disciplines. In the context of Bitcoin’s immense potential, I’d like to propose a vision of how Apple could harness this interdisciplinary approach to not only honor its legacy but also embrace the future.
1. User-Friendly Bitcoin Integration: Apple’s knack for seamlessly blending technology with user experience is legendary. Collaborations between computer scientists, UX designers, and educators could yield exceptional tools and resources to demystify Bitcoin for the masses. Imagine integrating lightning payments into Apple Pay, simplifying Bitcoin transactions and potentially eliminating the need to share revenue with banks and credit card providers. The user-friendly experience could redefine digital payments.
2. Regulatory Collaboration: In navigating the complex regulatory landscape, Apple could work alongside legal experts and economists to develop clear frameworks. By demonstrating a commitment to balancing innovation with consumer protection, Apple can win the trust of regulators and lawmakers. This proactive stance could pave the way for Bitcoin’s wider acceptance and lessen the need for protracted litigation battles.
3. Financial Services Revolution: Collaborating with fintech experts and developers, Apple could design financial products and services that harness Bitcoin’s power while ensuring security and compliance. A notable challenge is the absence of chargeback mechanisms in Bitcoin. Here, Apple could innovate by exploring solutions that preserve Bitcoin’s core tenets of trustlessness and immutability while offering users optional chargeback mechanisms through trusted third parties.
While some purists may resist the idea of chargebacks, the goal is to strike a balance and let Bitcoiners decide on the tradeoffs they are willing to make. By fostering innovation in this area, Apple can help Bitcoin accommodate a wider range of users and use cases.
4. Societal Impact: It’s my belief that Bitcoin can be a force for societal betterment, promoting financial inclusion, economic development, and individual sovereignty. Instead of dismantling existing systems, Bitcoin offers a way to improve them. It’s disheartening to see Apple, once known for its rebellious spirit, shy away from such an opportunity.
Imagine a world where people can send micropayments over social media to directly support each other’s creativity and content. Technologies like Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and the decentralized Nostr protocol are making this possible.
Rather than viewing this as a threat to centralized app store fees and control, Apple could embrace and accelerate such innovation. Seamless Bitcoin/Lightning and Nostr integration on Apple devices may unlock new economic and creative opportunities globally.
The spirit of decentralized innovation aligns with ideals of freedom and empowerment. Enabling people to directly exchange value may seed groundbreaking ideas. As Apple knows well, creativity and innovation thrive when restrictions are removed.
If Apple taps into the promise of Bitcoin’s lightning-fast micropayments and decentralized platforms like Nostr, they could propagate far-reaching economic and creative empowerment worldwide. The future will belong to those who don’t just optimize existing models but reimagine technology’s relationship with freedom and humanity.

Binance’s rollercoaster week: expansion, setbacks, and the ghost of FTX’s collapse;"From the Editor’s Desk
Dear Reader,
It’s been quite the week for Binance. The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange has been headline news on our pages for some time now. And that’s no mean feat considering the Sam Bankman-Fried trial is still only a few weeks old and readers all over the world remain glued to their screens, waiting to learn the fate of crypto’s most (in)famous individual.
Second on that list, arguably, is Changpang Zhao, known to most as CZ. The Binance CEO and co-founder was a one-time mentor to SBF. Something of a crypto-older-brother to the FTX founder, Zhao was there for Bankman-Fried in the early days of the collapsed exchange, becoming one of the first investors and helping FTX off the ground.
But he was also reportedly there as it all came crashing down. At one stage in November last year, when rumors of a multi-billion dollar shortfall in customer funds at FTX came to light, it appeared as though Zhao may step in to bail SBF out. But it wasn’t to be. Zhao and Binance pulled out of an agreement to buy FTX at the last minute and… well… we all know what happened next.
For some time before Bankman-Fried’s rapid fall from grace, there had been whispers that Zhao was less than impressed by the FTX boss’s apparent cozying-up to U.S. regulators. Some reports even allege that he had a hand in exposing the balance sheet discrepancies that brought the curtain down on FTX. It was Zhao, after all, who contributed to the run at FTX when he said he would sell all Binance’s holdings in its native token FTT.
Regardless of Zhao’s alleged involvement in FTX’s demise, this could and should have been a triumphant moment for Binance. The exchange’s main rivals are no longer part of the picture. The company continues its outward expansion into territories new — Japan in particular representing a particularly promising growth market for the brand. 
But it’s not exactly smooth sailing elsewhere. Binance said it will no longer register new users in the U.K. on Monday in response to the country’s new overseas promotion rules, while on Tuesday Binance.US announced it has suspended U.S. dollar withdrawals for U.S. customers. Add that to the announcement last week that Brazil’s regulators want to indict Zhao for running a pyramid scheme, and the picture starts to look far less rosy.
Of course, Binance remains a juggernaut. Its website claims the exchange has 150 million users worldwide, enjoying a daily transaction volume of US$65 billion. But the lay of the land has without doubt turned a little bumpy, while there’s some really mountainous terrain up ahead.
Where the journey leads is yet to be decided. But knowing Binance and Zhao, it’s bound to be one heck of a ride.
Until the next time,  
Angie Lau,Founder and Editor-in-ChiefForkast.News
Binance Japan started trading operations Aug. 1, launching with an impressive 34 coins on its platform. The number might be a fraction of what Binance’s global exchange offers, but for the Japanese crypto market, it marks a significant leap. The number places Binance Japan at the forefront of the domestic industry in terms of cryptocurrency variety.
Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?
The picture can look a little bleak for Binance in the West. U.S. regulation in particular and the threat of legal action there has slowed the company’s momentum. It has been forced to beat a hasty retreat from Canada and a host of European jurisdictions. The business landscape is also growing increasingly complicated in the U.K. The exchange announced Monday it will no longer accept new customers in the country in compliance with local regulations.
Binance is far from alone in facing these challenges. Crypto businesses are struggling across the board. It’s just that Binance’s size and industry heft means it inevitably attracts a lot of the ire aimed at the wider industry. And like the wider industry, it’s now looking for opportunities beyond Europe and the U.S. — powerhouses for both traditional finance and the digital economy — toward the Asia-Pacific region, which is emerging as something of a crypto haven.
One key region for the company is Japan. Blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis shows that while India leads the world in crypto adoption and other APAC regions such as Indonesia and Vietnam are accelerating their crypto uptake, blockchain adoption in Japan is also significant. 
The nation’s government is never shy about promoting Japan as a regional hub for Web3, which it has positioned over the past year as a key economic growth strategy. It aims to use blockchain technologies like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to unlock hidden value in Japan’s graying society and address the rapid onset of regional depopulation.
But exactly how it aims to do that remains unclear. While the will is there, Japanese developers express a lack of blockchain understanding among policy-makers. There is therefore a sense that a current wave of government enthusiasm for Web3 could fizzle out without any specific strides for the industry. Which is where Binance could step in.
The exchange was able to fast-track its official arrival in Japan this August despite past run-ins with regulators. Despite the legal baggage it carries elsewhere, there is clearly a desire among policymakers and industry advocates to leverage the experience and technical knowhow that Binance brings to the table.
Could Japan emerge as a home-away-from-home for the company? The official arrival of Binance Japan has at least stirred up a lot of conversation and crypto interest in the country.
Refik Anadol’s artificial intelligence (AI)-created art collection “Winds of Yawanawa” is currently the top non-fungible token collection on the Ethereum blockchain. 
Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?
It’s not often that art gets a chance to take center stage in NFTs, but when a milestone such as Refik Anadol’s recent accomplishments arrives, it must be talked about. 
For the past few weeks, Refik has represented the heart of NFTs, serving as a much needed distraction from the current 33-month low point for the NFT market. His art and its success has reminded the collective community about the roots of NFT technology, which is the provenance it preserves, and the financial opportunities it offers to artists.
While Anadol’s art being featured on the Las Vegas Sphere and being acquired by the Museum of Modern art are milestones for NFTs, they’re equally as important for the world of AI art. His work lives at the cutting edge of two fronts, showcasing how AI can be used as a tool to create beauty, while using technology to preserve it. 
Using data from Acre Brazil’s Yawanawa tribe’s village in the Amazon rainforest, Refik painted wind speeds, direction, gusts, and temperatures onto a digital canvas with AI tools to create the iconic 1,000 edition “Winds of Yawanawa” collection. 
The collection also highlights another important side of NFTs, one that is rarely talked about. We’re accustomed to hearing about scams and manipulations across the blockchain industry, but seldom do we hear about good deeds in the NFT ecosystem. The “Winds of Yawanawa” collection was co-created with artists from the Yawanawa tribe, and because of that collaboration, the tribe earns royalties for each NFT sold on secondary markets. 
To date the “Winds of Yawanawa” collection has traded for over US$9.4 million, with 10% of all sales going directly to the Yawanawa tribe. While royalties are no longer enforced on marketplaces, most art collectors happily honor artists’ requested royalties. In a space that witnessed a US$6.2 million generative art sale over the summer, a US$69 million Beeple NFT sale in 2021, the Art Blocks platform’s US$1.4 billion in all-time sales, and now Refik Anadol’s milestone collection of AI art, a picture is being painted on the blockchain that may help you understand just how significant the art movement in NFTs really is.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink addressed the recent fleeting surge in Bitcoin prices during an appearance on the Fox Business broadcast on Monday, highlighting the immense global interest in cryptocurrency.
Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?
Bitcoin’s latest major price swing was fueled by the industry’s longing to see a spot Bitcoin ETF open for business in the world’s largest economy. It not only demonstrated investors’ appetite for cryptocurrencies, as noted by BlackRock’s Larry Fink. It also revealed the asset’s responsiveness to unfolding events and hearsay. 
The quick correction from Cointelegraph after the outlet’s mistaken ETF claim reflects the lightning-fast dissemination of information in the internet era. It fires a clear message to the financial community about the importance of due diligence in today’s rapid information age.
BlackRock’s flirtation with the Bitcoin ETF sphere is a sign of the times, pointing toward a growing institutional interest in digital assets. A potential alliance with platforms like Coinbase Custody, contingent on regulatory blessings, could mark the beginning of an advanced framework for further institutional forays into the crypto world.
For investors, a spot Bitcoin ETF would become another channel to legally bet on the success of digital assets. But for existing cryptocurrency industry participants, it would serve as a lifeline that brings much needed funds, liquidity and mainstream interest into the sector. 
The so-called “crypto winter” and wider macroeconomic headwinds have hastened the demise of multiple Web3 firms. Even the strongest and the fittest companies left behind now tend to operate with a much smaller workforce and war chest. The introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF would be a turning point. 
While rejuvenating the dwindling reserves of these firms, this new financial instrument could also instill renewed confidence among stakeholders. As mainstream investors gain an easier and more regulated avenue into Bitcoin investment, the resultant inflow of capital could stabilize the volatile crypto market, fostering an environment ripe for increased growth and innovation.

From the Editor’s Desk
Dear Reader,
It’s been quite the week for Binance. The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange has been headline news on our pages for some time now. And that’s no mean feat considering the Sam Bankman-Fried trial is still only a few weeks old and readers all over the world remain glued to their screens, waiting to learn the fate of crypto’s most (in)famous individual.
Second on that list, arguably, is Changpang Zhao, known to most as CZ. The Binance CEO and co-founder was a one-time mentor to SBF. Something of a crypto-older-brother to the FTX founder, Zhao was there for Bankman-Fried in the early days of the collapsed exchange, becoming one of the first investors and helping FTX off the ground.
But he was also reportedly there as it all came crashing down. At one stage in November last year, when rumors of a multi-billion dollar shortfall in customer funds at FTX came to light, it appeared as though Zhao may step in to bail SBF out. But it wasn’t to be. Zhao and Binance pulled out of an agreement to buy FTX at the last minute and… well… we all know what happened next.
For some time before Bankman-Fried’s rapid fall from grace, there had been whispers that Zhao was less than impressed by the FTX boss’s apparent cozying-up to U.S. regulators. Some reports even allege that he had a hand in exposing the balance sheet discrepancies that brought the curtain down on FTX. It was Zhao, after all, who contributed to the run at FTX when he said he would sell all Binance’s holdings in its native token FTT.
Regardless of Zhao’s alleged involvement in FTX’s demise, this could and should have been a triumphant moment for Binance. The exchange’s main rivals are no longer part of the picture. The company continues its outward expansion into territories new — Japan in particular representing a particularly promising growth market for the brand. 
But it’s not exactly smooth sailing elsewhere. Binance said it will no longer register new users in the U.K. on Monday in response to the country’s new overseas promotion rules, while on Tuesday Binance.US announced it has suspended U.S. dollar withdrawals for U.S. customers. Add that to the announcement last week that Brazil’s regulators want to indict Zhao for running a pyramid scheme, and the picture starts to look far less rosy.
Of course, Binance remains a juggernaut. Its website claims the exchange has 150 million users worldwide, enjoying a daily transaction volume of US$65 billion. But the lay of the land has without doubt turned a little bumpy, while there’s some really mountainous terrain up ahead.
Where the journey leads is yet to be decided. But knowing Binance and Zhao, it’s bound to be one heck of a ride.
Until the next time,

Binance Japan started trading operations Aug. 1, launching with an impressive 34 coins on its platform. The number might be a fraction of what Binance’s global exchange offers, but for the Japanese crypto market, it marks a significant leap. The number places Binance Japan at the forefront of the domestic industry in terms of cryptocurrency variety.
Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?
The picture can look a little bleak for Binance in the West. U.S. regulation in particular and the threat of legal action there has slowed the company’s momentum. It has been forced to beat a hasty retreat from Canada and a host of European jurisdictions. The business landscape is also growing increasingly complicated in the U.K. The exchange announced Monday it will no longer accept new customers in the country in compliance with local regulations.
Binance is far from alone in facing these challenges. Crypto businesses are struggling across the board. It’s just that Binance’s size and industry heft means it inevitably attracts a lot of the ire aimed at the wider industry. And like the wider industry, it’s now looking for opportunities beyond Europe and the U.S. — powerhouses for both traditional finance and the digital economy — toward the Asia-Pacific region, which is emerging as something of a crypto haven.
One key region for the company is Japan. Blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis shows that while India leads the world in crypto adoption and other APAC regions such as Indonesia and Vietnam are accelerating their crypto uptake, blockchain adoption in Japan is also significant. 
The nation’s government is never shy about promoting Japan as a regional hub for Web3, which it has positioned over the past year as a key economic growth strategy. It aims to use blockchain technologies like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to unlock hidden value in Japan’s graying society and address the rapid onset of regional depopulation.
But exactly how it aims to do that remains unclear. While the will is there, Japanese developers express a lack of blockchain understanding among policy-makers. There is therefore a sense that a current wave of government enthusiasm for Web3 could fizzle out without any specific strides for the industry. Which is where Binance could step in.
The exchange was able to fast-track its official arrival in Japan this August despite past run-ins with regulators. Despite the legal baggage it carries elsewhere, there is clearly a desire among policymakers and industry advocates to leverage the experience and technical knowhow that Binance brings to the table.
Could Japan emerge as a home-away-from-home for the company? The official arrival of Binance Japan has at least stirred up a lot of conversation and crypto interest in the country.
Refik Anadol’s artificial intelligence (AI)-created art collection “Winds of Yawanawa” is currently the top non-fungible token collection on the Ethereum blockchain. 
Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?
It’s not often that art gets a chance to take center stage in NFTs, but when a milestone such as Refik Anadol’s recent accomplishments arrives, it must be talked about. 
For the past few weeks, Refik has represented the heart of NFTs, serving as a much needed distraction from the current 33-month low point for the NFT market. His art and its success has reminded the collective community about the roots of NFT technology, which is the provenance it preserves, and the financial opportunities it offers to artists.
While Anadol’s art being featured on the Las Vegas Sphere and being acquired by the Museum of Modern art are milestones for NFTs, they’re equally as important for the world of AI art. His work lives at the cutting edge of two fronts, showcasing how AI can be used as a tool to create beauty, while using technology to preserve it. 
Using data from Acre Brazil’s Yawanawa tribe’s village in the Amazon rainforest, Refik painted wind speeds, direction, gusts, and temperatures onto a digital canvas with AI tools to create the iconic 1,000 edition “Winds of Yawanawa” collection. 
The collection also highlights another important side of NFTs, one that is rarely talked about. We’re accustomed to hearing about scams and manipulations across the blockchain industry, but seldom do we hear about good deeds in the NFT ecosystem. The “Winds of Yawanawa” collection was co-created with artists from the Yawanawa tribe, and because of that collaboration, the tribe earns royalties for each NFT sold on secondary markets. 
To date the “Winds of Yawanawa” collection has traded for over US$9.4 million, with 10% of all sales going directly to the Yawanawa tribe. While royalties are no longer enforced on marketplaces, most art collectors happily honor artists’ requested royalties. In a space that witnessed a US$6.2 million generative art sale over the summer, a US$69 million Beeple NFT sale in 2021, the Art Blocks platform’s US$1.4 billion in all-time sales, and now Refik Anadol’s milestone collection of AI art, a picture is being painted on the blockchain that may help you understand just how significant the art movement in NFTs really is.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink addressed the recent fleeting surge in Bitcoin prices during an appearance on the Fox Business broadcast on Monday, highlighting the immense global interest in cryptocurrency.
Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?
Bitcoin’s latest major price swing was fueled by the industry’s longing to see a spot Bitcoin ETF open for business in the world’s largest economy. It not only demonstrated investors’ appetite for cryptocurrencies, as noted by BlackRock’s Larry Fink. It also revealed the asset’s responsiveness to unfolding events and hearsay. 
The quick correction from Cointelegraph after the outlet’s mistaken ETF claim reflects the lightning-fast dissemination of information in the internet era. It fires a clear message to the financial community about the importance of due diligence in today’s rapid information age.
BlackRock’s flirtation with the Bitcoin ETF sphere is a sign of the times, pointing toward a growing institutional interest in digital assets. A potential alliance with platforms like Coinbase Custody, contingent on regulatory blessings, could mark the beginning of an advanced framework for further institutional forays into the crypto world.
For investors, a spot Bitcoin ETF would become another channel to legally bet on the success of digital assets. But for existing cryptocurrency industry participants, it would serve as a lifeline that brings much needed funds, liquidity and mainstream interest into the sector. 
The so-called “crypto winter” and wider macroeconomic headwinds have hastened the demise of multiple Web3 firms. Even the strongest and the fittest companies left behind now tend to operate with a much smaller workforce and war chest. The introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF would be a turning point. 
While rejuvenating the dwindling reserves of these firms, this new financial instrument could also instill renewed confidence among stakeholders.

U.S. Treasury targets crypto mixer transactions as new class of ‘primary money laundering concern’;"The U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) announced on Oct. 19 that it is advancing regulation that could broadly restrict crypto mixers.
The agency’s Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) identifies transactions made through convertible virtual currency (CVC) mixing platforms — generally referred to as crypto mixers — as a “class of transactions of primary money laundering concern.”
Wally Adeyemo, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, said in a statement:
“Today’s action underscores Treasury’s commitment to combating the exploitation of Convertible Virtual Currency mixing by a broad range of illicit actors, including state-affiliated cyber actors, cyber criminals, and terrorist groups.”
The Treasury more broadly noted that the lack of transparency around crypto mixing is a national security risk. FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki, meanwhile, said that coin mixers support ransomware attackers, rogue state actors, and criminals. She added that the newly proposed policy marks FinCEN’s first use of Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act to target a class of transactions of primary money laundering concern.
The Treasury has previously sanctioned individual coin mixers. It sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022 and sanctioned Blender.io in May 2022.
Adeyemo added that the Treasury is “aggressively” fighting other illegal transactions and transfers within the convertible virtual currency (CVC) ecosystem. He specifically mentioned that the government agency is targeting cryptocurrency use by widely recognized terrorist groups such as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
The Israel–Hamas war has led to a recent focus on enforcement in this area. On Oct. 18, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on various Hamas-linked entities. The latest list of sanctions includes one Bitcoin (BTC) address linked to Buy Cash, a Gaza-based cryptocurrency exchange and money transfer platform. The platform’s operator, Ahmed M. M. Alaqad, has also been designated.
OFAC said that the address in question was one of many seized by Israeli authorities in June 2021. Buy Cash itself has more broadly facilitated crypto transfers for Hamas and other terrorist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
Also in October, U.S. lawmakers urged the Biden administration to take action against Hamas, and Israeli authorities blocked a number of crypto addresses.
Analytics group Chainalysis, meanwhile, has attempted to reassure the public that illegal transactions make up only a small portion of crypto transfers.

Expert Price Breakdown: The Truth Behind Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE) Upcoming Trends;"When you glance at the vast expanse of the crypto ocean, the waves are massive, and the undertow is strong. Recent events surrounding Bitcoin, especially the 10% jump hinting towards ETF launches, have created an electrifying atmosphere. BlackRock's potential ETF, which spiked Bitcoin's price momentarily, indicates the kind of volatility and potential this market possesses. As we march toward an era where crypto adoption becomes more mainstream, market responses to news, whether accurate or not, demonstrates the sentiment and reactivity of traders. Indeed, recent events have given investors an unexpected playbook for future movements.
While Bitcoin's ETF buzz keeps everyone on their toes, Dogecoin's recent luxury car connection has everyone talking. For those hungry for an expert perspective on DOGE's next move, StealthEX offers a compelling Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction – a forecast that might just change the way you view this meme coin. But DOGE's not alone in making headlines. Join us as we dive deeper into the market's latest whirlwind of events, from SHIB's fiery tactics to PEPE's scandalous past.
In a significant move showcasing the ever-growing bond between luxury brands and digital currencies, Ferrari, the renowned Italian-based luxury sports car manufacturer, has announced that it will be embracing crypto payments. This adoption includes Shiba Inu. Partnering with BitPay, a leader in the crypto payment processing realm, Ferrari has commenced crypto payments for its luxury cars in the United States. The gears are already in motion to extend this novel payment mode to European nations as well. This game-changing decision was shared with the world by Enrico Galliera, Ferrari's chief marketing and commercial officer. Rooted in feedback from their expansive customer base and dealers, who have recently delved deep into the crypto investments, Ferrari's crypto integration reflects the shifting sands of luxury commerce. If you're intrigued by SHIB's growing influence and wish to be a part of its journey, you can swap USDT to SHIB seamlessly on StealthEX. This platform also supports the exchange of other cryptos for SHIB.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also making moves of its own. The meme coin recently reported a 250% increase in its token burn rate. By strategically removing a staggering 53 million SHIB tokens from circulation, the intent is clear: drive up scarcity and value. 
The figures suggest a tale of cautious optimism. SHIB’s price, despite these burns, has shown modest gains. Its resistance levels and moving averages indicate an upward momentum, suggesting the coin might be preparing for a substantial move. Its blockchain solution, Shibarium, could be the wildcard that drives its value further up.
Currently priced between $0.00000688 and $0.00000793, the coin is delicately poised below its 10-day moving average of $0.00000695 and its 200-day moving average of $0.00000845. If bulls gain momentum, overcoming the resistance at $0.00000851 is crucial before challenging the stiffer test at $0.0000095. On the downside, while $0.00000641 offers some reprieve, a slip below might see it testing the depths at $0.00000536. 
Though Ferrari's spotlight currently shines on Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin remains an interesting play in the market. Whispers around town suggest you might soon buy a Ferrari with DOGE as well. Billy Markus, the co-founder of DOGE, recently touched upon the luxury automobile giant, Ferrari, embracing cryptocurrencies. While he humorously hinted at the crypto community's affordability (or lack thereof) for such luxury vehicles, the real tidbit here is the potential inclusion of Dogecoin in Ferrari's payment arsenal. 
Given that Ferrari's collaboration is with BitPay, DOGE might just be in the list soon. Exciting, right? But before you dream of revving up a Ferrari engine with your DOGE coins, you might want to see what the DOGE price prediction for the distant future looks like – will Dogecoin even exist there? 
Meanwhile, the coin's technical indicators tell a different story. Operating in a price range of $0.05929 to $0.06481, DOGE currently dances below both its 10-day and 200-day moving averages, priced at $0.05914 and $0.07008, respectively. This signifies bearish pressure. The looming resistance at $0.06760 and then at $0.07312 might be tough to break, especially given the 200-day average acting as another resistance point. However, if the price breaks below the $0.05655 support, the next significant level to watch is $0.05103. 
If Dogecoin piques your interest and you're considering an investment, don't hesitate to swap ETH to DOGE through StealthEX. With its support for all popular cryptocurrencies, there’s a good chance you’ll have a way to buy DOGE with the crypto you have.
Lastly, let's delve into Pepe coin, which has found itself embroiled in controversy recently. What was initially brushed off as a mere meme coin has faced serious allegations with connections to a ""pump and dump"" scheme and allegations of significant fund misappropriation. Such news stories have cast a shadow over its reputation, making investors wary. 
But as history suggests, adversity often precedes growth. Pepe's value metrics offer a mix of uncertainty and promise. If you're feeling adventurous and curious about what Pepe coin has to offer, make the jump and swap ETH to PEPE on StealthEX. You can also exchange any of the 1,400 supported cryptocurrencies using this platform.
With a year-to-date growth of over 100%, it's clear that despite its setbacks, Pepe has a compelling story to tell. Its volatile price journey, which saw monumental rises and dips, could either be seen as a cautionary tale or an investor's dream of high risk and high reward.
PEPE's price dynamics reveal a coin under the spotlight for reasons both right and wrong. Presently trading in the range of $0.000000657 and $0.000000883, the coin rests precariously below its 10-day and 100-day moving averages, indicating bearish sentiment. The resistances at $0.000000968 and then at $0.000001195 stand as the formidable guardians for any bullish run. Conversely, if PEPE begins to slide, the support at $0.000000516 is its immediate cushion, but a more significant fall could see it plummet to the next support level at $0.000000290.
In conclusion, the crypto world's allure lies in its unpredictability. These three meme coins, each with its own tale of rags and potential riches, embody this sentiment. As with any investment, due diligence, and a keen eye on market trends are key. While Dogecoin's luxury aspirations, Shiba Inu's strategic plays, and Pepe coin's dark horse narrative are enticing, only time will truly unveil the path they carve in the vast crypto landscape.

Tesla Maintains $184M Bitcoin Holdings as Elon Musk Flags Concerns Over High Interest Rates;"Tesla’s third-quarter financial statement reveals that the electric car company has not sold any of its bitcoin. Its most recent balance sheet shows that Tesla continues to hold bitcoin valued at $184 million. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has raised concerns about the high-interest rate environment affecting the auto industry.
Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) released its third-quarter earnings results on Wednesday. The company reported $23.35 billion in revenue and $1.85 billion in profits, marking declines compared to the previous quarter.
Despite its earnings missing Wall Street expectations, the electric car company’s balance sheet still shows net digital assets of $184 million. This is the fourth straight quarter that Tesla has recorded the same value for its digital assets, which mostly consist of bitcoin (BTC).
Tesla invested $1.5 billion in BTC in Q1 2021 but sold 75% of its holdings in Q2 2022. Musk explained at the time that the company is “certainly open” to increasing its bitcoin holdings in the future, noting that the sale was due to concerns about the company’s overall liquidity, “given Covid shutdowns in China.” Tesla’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also states: “We may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions.” In January, Tesla’s SEC filing showed the fair market value of the company’s BTC holdings was $191 million at the end of 2022.
The electric car company also accepts the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) for some merchandise, which accounted for an “immaterial amount” of digital assets as stated in the company’s SEC filing.
During Tesla’s Q3 earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk highlighted several concerns affecting his company’s profitability, including the high interest rate environment. He stressed:
I am worried about the high interest rate environment that we’re in. I just can’t emphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment.
“As interest rates rise, the proportion of that monthly payment that is interest increases naturally,” Musk said. “If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it’s that much harder for people to buy the car. They simply can’t afford it.”
What do you think about Tesla maintaining its bitcoin holdings and Elon Musk’s interest rate concerns? Let us know in the comments section below.

Its most recent balance sheet shows that Tesla continues to hold bitcoin valued at $184 million. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has raised concerns about the high-interest rate environment affecting the auto industry.
Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) released its third-quarter earnings results on Wednesday. The company reported $23.35 billion in revenue and $1.85 billion in profits, marking declines compared to the previous quarter.
Despite its earnings missing Wall Street expectations, the electric car company’s balance sheet still shows net digital assets of $184 million. This is the fourth straight quarter that Tesla has recorded the same value for its digital assets, which mostly consist of bitcoin (BTC).
Tesla invested $1.5 billion in BTC in Q1 2021 but sold 75% of its holdings in Q2 2022. Musk explained at the time that the company is “certainly open” to increasing its bitcoin holdings in the future, noting that the sale was due to concerns about the company’s overall liquidity, “given Covid shutdowns in China.” Tesla’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also states: “We may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions.” In January, Tesla’s SEC filing showed the fair market value of the company’s BTC holdings was $191 million at the end of 2022.
The electric car company also accepts the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) for some merchandise, which accounted for an “immaterial amount” of digital assets as stated in the company’s SEC filing.
During Tesla’s Q3 earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk highlighted several concerns affecting his company’s profitability, including the high interest rate environment. He stressed:
I am worried about the high interest rate environment that we’re in. I just can’t emphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment.
“As interest rates rise, the proportion of that monthly payment that is interest increases naturally,” Musk said. “If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it’s that much harder for people to buy the car. They simply can’t afford it.”
What do you think about Tesla maintaining its bitcoin holdings and Elon Musk’s interest rate concerns? Let us know in the comments section below.

“There were reactions in both directions. Some multilateral organizations initially made objections.

Tether Freezes 32 Crypto Addresses Linked To Terrorism In Israel And Ukraine;"Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin company, has reaffirmed its commitment to combating cryptocurrency-funded terrorism and warfare by collaborating with law enforcement agencies worldwide. 
The company has frozen 32 addresses containing $873,118.34, allegedly linked to illicit activities in Israel and Ukraine. 
According to a blog post on October 16, Tether has played a significant role in assisting 31 law enforcement agencies across 19 jurisdictions, freezing $835 million in assets primarily associated with thefts from blockchain and exchange hacks. 
The company’s collaborations span various countries, including Brazil, Singapore, Germany, Canada, Argentina, China, Ukraine, and the United States. By actively engaging with authorities, Tether aims to contribute to the fight against cybercrime and ensure stolen funds are returned to legitimate users. The company further stated: 
Of this, Tether has frozen 32 addresses, containing $873,118.34, that were found to be linked to illicit activity in Israel and Ukraine. Tether has been working with the NBCTF in Israel to counter cryptocurrency-funded terrorism and warfare.
The ability of Tether to freeze and return illicitly obtained funds highlights the traceability and transparency of blockchain transactions. Contrary to common misconceptions, cryptocurrency transactions are not anonymous; they are meticulously recorded on the blockchain, allowing for the tracking and tracing of fund movements. 
The recently announced CEO of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, emphasized that criminals using cryptocurrencies for illegal activities will inevitably be identified. Ardoino stated: 
Tether remains committed to promoting responsible blockchain technology use and standing as a robust defense against cybercrime. We eagerly anticipate continued collaboration with global law enforcement agencies as part of our commitment to global security and financial integrity.
While Tether’s actions demonstrate the industry’s capacity to combat criminal use effectively, some critics within the blockchain industry continue to scrutinize the crypto sector, often neglecting to address the slow or inadequately equipped traditional financial system’s role in combating criminal funding. 
On this matter, Tether’s CEO emphasized the importance of recognizing the traceability and trackability of blockchain transactions, which serve as potent deterrents to illicit activities.
As the stablecoin company behind USDT continues to collaborate with law enforcement agencies globally, the company’s efforts highlight the potential of blockchain technology to enhance financial security and integrity. 
The traceability of transactions provided by blockchain technologies offers a robust defense against cybercrime and illicit financial activities.
As the fight against cybercrime intensifies, continued collaboration between cryptocurrency companies and law enforcement agencies will play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and stability of the digital asset space.

A Very Curious Thing Happened to Bitcoin for the First Time in 2023;"TL;DR

As revealed by the behavior analytics platform Santiment, the number of Bitcoin wallets containing at least 100 BTC has recently spiked to almost 16,000. The figure was pumped with 115 new addresses last Saturday (October 13), registering the highest single-day increase this year. 
 #Bitcoin‘s number of wallets holding at least 100 $BTC has jumped to 15,970 after the largest single day jump of 2023 on Saturday. Since this accumulation, $BTC‘s price is +5.3%, and they may not be done. We will continue to monitor. https://t.co/l0drhvkf7E pic.twitter.com/0mDAmys7N4
— Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 18, 2023
Interestingly, the price of the leading cryptocurrency has soared by over 5% since these developments. The surge could have been even more significant should the reports indicating that the US SEC approved BlackRock’s application to launch a spot BTC ETF in America were true. 
The primary digital asset exploded to nearly $30,000 (per CoinGecko) minutes after the coverages circulated the crypto space. However, it quickly retraced to approximately $28,000 once there was more clarity.
As CryptoPotato previously reported, Bitcoin sharks and whales have considerably increased their exposure to the asset since the market crash in mid-August. Data from the end of August showed that such large investors have purchased over 11,600 BTC in less than a week. 
We also released a video depicting the six Bitcoin billionaires. Those willing to take a look at their exclusive club could watch the clip below:

Pro-Ripple (XRP) Lawyer Bashes the SEC After Fake BTC ETF News;"TL;DR

The breaking reports from yesterday (October 16), which indicated that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said “yes” to BlackRock’s application to launch a spot BTC ETF in America, triggered a price rally for the primary cryptocurrency and overall excitement in the entire sector. 
However, the jolly was short-lived, with the news turning out to be fake. The regulator chipped in, warning X (Twitter) users to only believe in verified sources and not everything they read on the Internet.
John E. Deaton – a US attorney representing thousands of XRP investors in the lawsuit against the SEC – disagreed with the aforementioned statement, saying people should trust independent judges who oversee the watchdog, not the agency itself.
He claimed that an Appellate Court found the SEC to be “arbitrary and capricious.” According to him, the magistrates have also unanimously concluded that the regulator’s denial to approve a spot BTC ETF was “utter nonsense.” 
“Finally, a federal judge in the SDNY called the SEC lawyers hypocrites and stated they lacked faithful allegiance to the law. So, when it comes to the SEC, I choose to listen to judges. And man, are they speaking loudly,” Deaton concluded.
America’s securities regulator has launched several legal battles with various cryptocurrency companies, and so far, it has been on the losing side. 
Recall that Ripple secured two court wins in a row against the SEC: one in July and one earlier this month. Grayscale also managed to prevail after the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ordered the Commission to “vacate” its intention to reject the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF that tracks the performance of BTC.
In addition, the SEC sued two of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges – Binance and Coinbase – in June, accusing them of breaching certain laws and offering trading services with alleged unregistered securities such as BNB, SOL, MATIC, ADA, and others. Readers willing to learn more about those lawsuits can take a look at our video below:

The BRICS Jaguar – How does Brazil’s history influence its vision of crypto?;"Part of a series of deeper dives on BRICS members to see their individual economic and political trends to try to imagine how they will move forward on crypto and how this may affect the BRICS perspective on crypto.
Today, we focus on Brazil in BRICS, often called the “Jaguar”.-Brazil ranks 9th globally in economy size and 5th in land area.-Switches regularly between extreme opposing views, like a pendulum, due to political instability.-A strong man centralized political system persists throughout the constant changes.-A very centralized economic system with high inequality.-Expect strong government regulation or perhaps even banning cryptocurrencies.-Expect strong interest in CBDCs with extremely centralized control.-Expect the opposition to support the opposite.
Historical Background – Chaotic Beginnings and Resource Economy:
In 1500, Portuguese arrival marked the start of a resource-extraction-to-export economy. Early exports included brazilwood. The pace accelerated with sugar plantations, gold mines, and diamond mines, spanning the 1800s. Harsh conditions prevailed: 6 million slaves were brought from Africa to replace native slaves that died doing the hard labor. Conflicts with other natives, other Europeans, pirates, and slaves, complicated matters. Centralized control from afar, through wealthy landowners and the Church, fueled disunity. Autocratic rule continued even after independence in 1825. Wars with neighbors followed, affecting Brazil’s aversion to external interference. Most wars involved Argentina on the opposing side making the addition of Argentina to BRICS in 2024 an interesting situation.
By 1850, coffee made Brazil a major global supplier, but land degradation forced shifts. Rubber enriched the Amazonian regions. In 1889, a coup ended the monarchy, initiating diverse leadership phases – military coups, communists, and juntas.
Industrialization began in 1930, seeking ties with the US due to security concerns about Argentina’s militarization. WWII shifted Brazil to the Allies. A military regime ruled (1964-1985), curbing freedoms, fostering economic growth, but causing inequality and unrest.
Democracy returned in 1985, facing hyperinflation. Successive leaders privatized, managed crises. In the 2000s, Lula da Silva won support from the poor by continuing some policies, but also improving lives with initiatives around healthcare, poverty, and quality of life. Despite controversies, poverty reduction secured his re-election in 2005.
Lula’s successor, Dilma Rousseff, faced protests over spending and recession. During this time Lula was imprisoned on corruption charges.Jair Bolsonaro won in 2018, prioritizing security, infrastructure, and economic openness. Despite controversies, especially keeping the country open during Covid blamed for many deaths, he fought corruption and expanded connectivity through infrastructure during his tenure.
In 2022, Bolsonaro supporters clashed with Lula backers. A stark divide exists with no common ground in sight:
Left rule: chaos and insecurity, poverty and inequality reduction, healthcare gains, economic instability, high inflation and government spending.
Right rule: enhanced infrastructure, security, economic growth, but poverty and healthcare challenges.
Over two centuries, blending these approaches has proved elusive due to powerful ideological divisions. South American leftism is very anti-American and very pro-Soviet, historically, which makes Lula’s support for BRICS no surprise. The country is currently facing the problems that come from virtually every left-leaning government in Brazil’s history, causing a stir that could see power shift back to a right-leaning government again. As usual, Brazil remains unstable. In these conditions thousands of businesses have fled the country to rebuild somewhere else, some even in the high tax and high social safety net center of Europe as they see the costs of higher taxation to be less harmful to their business than economic uncertainty and government corruption. Brazil has a long way to address this balancing act challenge seeing its history of jumping back and forth between two extremes on every economic issue.
Brazil – Definition of an Emerging Economy
On top of having an unstable political and thereby unpredictable regulatory system, Brazil also meets other criteria of an emerging market economy. Namely, most of the country’s production and exports are raw materials such as iron ore, Soybeans, Crude Petroleum, Raw Sugar, Poultry Meat, and Gold. This would be indicative of a non developed market economy if not for some industrial production sneaking into the mix with Refined Petroleum products, Cars, Pig Iron being exported as well. While a developed economy still produces and may export large amounts of raw materials, it makes most of its trade balance income from exporting industrial products. For a good view of the make-up of Brazil’s current exports see the OEC visualization of Exports in 2021 by percentage of exports.
Then compare it to its main imports; nearly all processed and industrial high end goods such as Refined Petroleum, Motor Vehicles, Integrated Circuits, Semiconductors, Cars, Vaccines, Fertilizers, Pesticides. The last two being essential to keep production levels of Soybeans and other agricultural production.If this was all the information we had we would say Brazil is a non developed market economy but it does have some industries such as Embraer that produces planes, that produce higher technological products. Not nearly on the level of China, Russia, or India, but still much more than most economies in South America, Africa, Eastern Europe, or South-East Asia.
Brazil’s Trade Partners: BRICS or the West?
The following visualization from OEC is the percentage of Brazil’s exports by destination country and continent. 
And then the percentage of imports by country and continent of origin:
From these we see that Brazil trades mostly with Asia and Europe, China and the US. In exports Argentina comes third, a new BRICS member. While in imports Germany comes third, a definitely Western country. And it goes down the list between BRICS aligned and Western countries, each taking their turn in the list like two sports captains choosing their team’s players, each taking their turn. This may be a side effect of Brazil’s political leanings jumping back and forth, or a coincidence caused by the international market’s supply and demand meeting up with Brazil’s economy in just this almost perfectly balanced manner.
What does all of this have to do with Crypto?
Considering Brazil’s complex political, legal, economic history, and cultural background, several potential regulations and market trends can be anticipated for cryptocurrencies and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).Political tendencies push certain economic ideas. With Brazil having somewhat of a dual-personality disorder history in the political, legal, and economic sphere this would cause regulations for crypto to change drastically with every shift. And fiat currency would not be considered a safe haven as government strategies can change overnight. This would be a great market for gold or Bitcoin to catch on as alternatives to the local fiat currency.
Brazil’s history of political instability suggests a cautious approach to cryptos and CBDCs, emphasizing a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring robust regulatory oversight. Comprehensive regulations addressing concerns such as money laundering, fraud, and consumer protection are likely to be established for cryptos-related activities. Taxation policies could be implemented to cover cryptos transactions under Brazil’s intricate tax system, including capital gains taxes and income reporting requirements.
Considering Brazil’s economic inequality, CBDC initiatives might prioritize financial inclusion, utilizing digital currencies for direct benefit transfers to underserved populations. Collaborative efforts between the government and financial institutions could shape cryptos and CBDC frameworks that align with existing monetary policies and regulations. Furthermore, the integration of blockchain technology might extend beyond currency applications, offering solutions for supply chain management and public service transparency.
In light of Brazil’s diverse population and digital divide, public awareness campaigns could play a crucial role in educating citizens about cryptos and CBDCs, ensuring responsible usage. Brazil’s historical skepticism towards external intervention might lead to a focus on domestic regulatory development before engaging with international standards.
Given Brazil’s history of currency volatility, measures to manage cryptos price fluctuations could be explored, drawing from its experiences with economic instability. Consumer protection regulations might be strengthened to safeguard against cryptos-related scams and fraudulent activities, reflecting Brazil’s intricate social fabric.
Ultimately, Brazil’s approach to cryptos and CBDC regulations would be shaped by a delicate equilibrium between embracing innovation, maintaining financial stability, safeguarding consumers, and ensuring economic inclusion, all while accounting for its unique historical and cultural context. And any CBDC will be very centralized, so as to concentrate power in the hands of whoever is in charge at the time, just like everything else has been in the country since we have records of its economy and political systems.
Only time will tell if this is what will happen, but it does seem like these predictions are on track. What effect, if any, will Brazil have on BRICS policies towards currency? For now, not much.
The history of Brazil’s laws about cryptocurrencies and CBDCs can be summarized as follows:
Cryptocurrencies:
Here are the bills that are in the process of being passed:
CBDCs:
The BCB is currently working on a pilot project for the Digital Real. The pilot project is expected to start in 2023 and will involve a limited number of financial institutions. The BCB plans to launch the Digital Real to the general public in 2024.
The BCB has said that the Digital Real will have several benefits, including:
However, there are also some risks associated with CBDCs, such as:
The BCB is aware of these risks and is taking steps to mitigate them. For example, the BCB is considering using a permissioned blockchain for the Digital Real, which would limit access to the network and make it more secure.
The BCB is also working with other central banks and financial institutions to develop international standards for CBDCs. This will help to ensure that CBDCs are interoperable and can be used seamlessly across borders.
Overall, the BCB is taking a cautious approach to the development of the Digital Real. The bank is working to address the potential risks while also maximizing the potential benefits of CBDCs.

In the 2000s, Lula da Silva won support from the poor by continuing some policies, but also improving lives with initiatives around healthcare, poverty, and quality of life. Despite controversies, poverty reduction secured his re-election in 2005.
Lula’s successor, Dilma Rousseff, faced protests over spending and recession. During this time Lula was imprisoned on corruption charges.Jair Bolsonaro won in 2018, prioritizing security, infrastructure, and economic openness. Despite controversies, especially keeping the country open during Covid blamed for many deaths, he fought corruption and expanded connectivity through infrastructure during his tenure.
In 2022, Bolsonaro supporters clashed with Lula backers. A stark divide exists with no common ground in sight:
Left rule: chaos and insecurity, poverty and inequality reduction, healthcare gains, economic instability, high inflation and government spending.
Right rule: enhanced infrastructure, security, economic growth, but poverty and healthcare challenges.
Over two centuries, blending these approaches has proved elusive due to powerful ideological divisions. South American leftism is very anti-American and very pro-Soviet, historically, which makes Lula’s support for BRICS no surprise. The country is currently facing the problems that come from virtually every left-leaning government in Brazil’s history, causing a stir that could see power shift back to a right-leaning government again. As usual, Brazil remains unstable. In these conditions thousands of businesses have fled the country to rebuild somewhere else, some even in the high tax and high social safety net center of Europe as they see the costs of higher taxation to be less harmful to their business than economic uncertainty and government corruption. Brazil has a long way to address this balancing act challenge seeing its history of jumping back and forth between two extremes on every economic issue.
Brazil – Definition of an Emerging Economy
On top of having an unstable political and thereby unpredictable regulatory system, Brazil also meets other criteria of an emerging market economy. Namely, most of the country’s production and exports are raw materials such as iron ore, Soybeans, Crude Petroleum, Raw Sugar, Poultry Meat, and Gold. This would be indicative of a non developed market economy if not for some industrial production sneaking into the mix with Refined Petroleum products, Cars, Pig Iron being exported as well. While a developed economy still produces and may export large amounts of raw materials, it makes most of its trade balance income from exporting industrial products. For a good view of the make-up of Brazil’s current exports see the OEC visualization of Exports in 2021 by percentage of exports.
Then compare it to its main imports; nearly all processed and industrial high end goods such as Refined Petroleum, Motor Vehicles, Integrated Circuits, Semiconductors, Cars, Vaccines, Fertilizers, Pesticides. The last two being essential to keep production levels of Soybeans and other agricultural production.If this was all the information we had we would say Brazil is a non developed market economy but it does have some industries such as Embraer that produces planes, that produce higher technological products. Not nearly on the level of China, Russia, or India, but still much more than most economies in South America, Africa, Eastern Europe, or South-East Asia.
Brazil’s Trade Partners: BRICS or the West?
The following visualization from OEC is the percentage of Brazil’s exports by destination country and continent. 
And then the percentage of imports by country and continent of origin:
From these we see that Brazil trades mostly with Asia and Europe, China and the US. In exports Argentina comes third, a new BRICS member. While in imports Germany comes third, a definitely Western country. And it goes down the list between BRICS aligned and Western countries, each taking their turn in the list like two sports captains choosing their team’s players, each taking their turn. This may be a side effect of Brazil’s political leanings jumping back and forth, or a coincidence caused by the international market’s supply and demand meeting up with Brazil’s economy in just this almost perfectly balanced manner.
What does all of this have to do with Crypto?
Considering Brazil’s complex political, legal, economic history, and cultural background, several potential regulations and market trends can be anticipated for cryptocurrencies and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).Political tendencies push certain economic ideas. With Brazil having somewhat of a dual-personality disorder history in the political, legal, and economic sphere this would cause regulations for crypto to change drastically with every shift. And fiat currency would not be considered a safe haven as government strategies can change overnight. This would be a great market for gold or Bitcoin to catch on as alternatives to the local fiat currency.
Brazil’s history of political instability suggests a cautious approach to cryptos and CBDCs, emphasizing a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring robust regulatory oversight. Comprehensive regulations addressing concerns such as money laundering, fraud, and consumer protection are likely to be established for cryptos-related activities. Taxation policies could be implemented to cover cryptos transactions under Brazil’s intricate tax system, including capital gains taxes and income reporting requirements.
Considering Brazil’s economic inequality, CBDC initiatives might prioritize financial inclusion, utilizing digital currencies for direct benefit transfers to underserved populations. Collaborative efforts between the government and financial institutions could shape cryptos and CBDC frameworks that align with existing monetary policies and regulations. Furthermore, the integration of blockchain technology might extend beyond currency applications, offering solutions for supply chain management and public service transparency.
In light of Brazil’s diverse population and digital divide, public awareness campaigns could play a crucial role in educating citizens about cryptos and CBDCs, ensuring responsible usage. Brazil’s historical skepticism towards external intervention might lead to a focus on domestic regulatory development before engaging with international standards.
Given Brazil’s history of currency volatility, measures to manage cryptos price fluctuations could be explored, drawing from its experiences with economic instability. Consumer protection regulations might be strengthened to safeguard against cryptos-related scams and fraudulent activities, reflecting Brazil’s intricate social fabric.
Ultimately, Brazil’s approach to cryptos and CBDC regulations would be shaped by a delicate equilibrium between embracing innovation, maintaining financial stability, safeguarding consumers, and ensuring economic inclusion, all while accounting for its unique historical and cultural context. And any CBDC will be very centralized, so as to concentrate power in the hands of whoever is in charge at the time, just like everything else has been in the country since we have records of its economy and political systems.
Only time will tell if this is what will happen, but it does seem like these predictions are on track. What effect, if any, will Brazil have on BRICS policies towards currency? For now, not much.
The history of Brazil’s laws about cryptocurrencies and CBDCs can be summarized as follows:
Cryptocurrencies:
Here are the bills that are in the process of being passed:
CBDCs:
The BCB is currently working on a pilot project for the Digital Real. The pilot project is expected to start in 2023 and will involve a limited number of financial institutions. The BCB plans to launch the Digital Real to the general public in 2024.
The BCB has said that the Digital Real will have several benefits, including:
However, there are also some risks associated with CBDCs, such as:
The BCB is aware of these risks and is taking steps to mitigate them. For example, the BCB is considering using a permissioned blockchain for the Digital Real, which would limit access to the network and make it more secure.
The BCB is also working with other central banks and financial institutions to develop international standards for CBDCs. This will help to ensure that CBDCs are interoperable and can be used seamlessly across borders.
Overall, the BCB is taking a cautious approach to the development of the Digital Real. The bank is working to address the potential risks while also maximizing the potential benefits of CBDCs.

Bitcoin Takes The Lead As Crypto Funds See Third Straight Week Of Inflows;"Despite an array of uncertainties that have dotted the crypto horizon, recent data from Coinshares reveals a continuous faith in the sector, especially the foremost crypto giant, Bitcoin.
Digital asset investment products have seen a steady and positive trend, recording net inflows for three weeks. Amid these inflows, Bitcoin emerges as the most dominant, presenting a robust case for its standing in the market.
According to the latest report by CoinShares, Bitcoin-centric products experienced inflows amounting to $16 million just in the past week. This surge has swelled the year-to-date inflows, positioning them at $260 million. CoinShares’ data also shed light on inflows into Short-Bitcoin funds, which amounted to $1.7 million.
However, the report reveals that the recent data might not reflect the aftermath of the SEC’s decision not to appeal against the Grayscale legal challenge. James Butterfill, the Head of Research at CoinShares, noted:
It is worth noting that our data, which is as of Friday’s close, was unlikely to capture the positive news out of the US regarding the SEC not appealing the Grayscale legal challenge, potentially paving the way for a spot-based ETF in the US.
While Bitcoin held its ground, other cryptocurrencies also showcased noteworthy movements. Solana’s investment products added roughly $3.7 million, building upon the $24 million from the previous week. 
XRP maintained momentum, recording its 25th week of positive inflows with an additional $420,000. Butterfill highlighted the continuous support from the “investment community” for XRP, especially in light of the recent “successful legal challenges” against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
However, it wasn’t all sunshine and roses. Ethereum funds witnessed a setback, with outflows of $7.4 million. This seemed to neutralize most inflows after the launch of six Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) the previous week. 
Butterfill pointed towards potential “protocol design concerns” as a plausible reason. Other digital assets such as Litecoin, Chainlink, and Tezos also witnessed minor outflows of $280,000, $310,000, and $250,000, respectively.
Regarding the global distribution of these inflows, Germany stood out, accounting for the bulk of the week’s inflows with $16.1 million. The US and Canada followed suit, with inflows of $2.1 million and $3.5 million respectively. 
Interestingly, Sweden was the only European nation to witness an outflow of $7.5 million. Butterfill states that despite this positive net inflow trend, “trading volumes remain 27% below the 2023 average.”
Regardless, Bitcoin, which led the pack in last week’s inflow, experienced a dramatic shift in recent hours. Specifically, the asset witnessed a swift surge above $30,000, propelled by an unsubstantiated rumor by Cointelegraph about the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot BTC ETF. The regulator debunked the rumors. 
However, the crypto quickly retraced its steps once the rumor was debunked, particularly by a FOX Business reporter.
BlackRock has just confirmed to me that this is false. Their application is still under review. https://t.co/XIfIWZ0Ule

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $28,049, still exhibiting bullish behavior with a 4.3% increase in the last 24 hours.

CoinTelegraph Reveals Timeline Of Events That Led To $100 Million In Bitcoin Liquidated;"Crypto media platform Cointelegraph has provided clarification on how the false Spot Bitcoin ETF approval news, which was released on its Twitter and Telegram platforms, came about. Although now deleted, the post caused a stir in the crypto community and crypto market by extension. 
According to a post released on its website, Cointelegraph stated that the news lead originated from “an unconfirmed screenshot posted by an X user who claimed it was from the Bloomberg Terminal.” The post further contained details of how the team got wind of the rumored news through a Telegram channel, which they usually get developing stories. 
Upon getting wind of this rumor, one of the platform’s employees reposted it in an internal Slack channel. However, without confirming the authenticity of the news, another employee went on to publish the development on their X and Telegram platform. This was reportedly done without getting the required editorial approval. 

The post simply stated that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved iShares Bitcoin Spot ETF. This Bitcoin Spot ETF in question happens to be the one that asset manager BlackRock plans to offer if approved by the SEC.
Following Cointelegraph’s post, many, including Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, questioned the veracity of the news. While this was ongoing, the employee who initially shared the post in the Slack channel noted that the source could not be found as the telegram account that posted it seems to have been deleted. 
This led to another employee editing the X and Telegram posts to include the word “reportedly” at the end of the post. The posts were eventually deleted after the news platform got confirmation from BlackRock that the report was incorrect while issuing a statement confirming that the information was inaccurate. 
It is worth mentioning that BTC hit $30,000 following Cointelegraph’s post, with such news usually signaling a bullish narrative. However, considering the circumstances surrounding the post, many traders in the crypto community made their frustrations known as the news led to almost $100 million in Bitcoins positions and over $157 million in crypto positions being liquidated in a 24-hour period, according to data from Coinglass.
Most of those affected were traders who had taken short positions, betting against an increase in Bitcoin’s price. Following the surge in Bitcoin’s price, over $71 million in short positions were wiped out instantly. 
Cointelegraph’s post also sparked some conspiracy theories, with some suggesting that the news platform was probably paid (or on their volition) to manipulate the market.
Online crypto casino Rollbit posted a screenshot of a trade that seemed to have been placed by someone at the media outlet. The screenshot showed that the trader had placed a long trade on BTC around the time when the false Spot Bitcoin ETF approval post was made. The said trader made over $2 million from the trade. However, this has not been confirmed to be true.

Hong Kong Crypto Exchange OSL Considers Sale at $170 Million;"Hong Kong’s BC Technology Group is looking into the sale of its cryptocurrency exchange OSL. OSL is one of only two crypto exchanges licensed under Hong Kong’s newly introduced regulatory regime. 
BC Technology is reportedly exploring selling its crypto platform OSL. According to reports by Bloomberg, citing persons familiar with the matter, BC Technology may sell parts of OSL business offerings rather than the whole platform. 
OSL, a cryptocurrency exchange licensed under Hong Kong’s newly introduced licensing framework, may be up for sale. BC Technology is exploring the sale of the exchange at a current valuation of $128 million (1 billion Hong Kong dollars).  
The Strait Times reports OSL offers prime brokerage, exchange, and custody services for crypto markets. The platform also provides infrastructure to financial institutions to enable them to offer virtual asset trading. 
Discussions are ongoing, and a deal has not yet been finalized. The company told Bloomberg: 
""We do not comment on market rumors and speculations.""
Due to regulatory uncertainty, Hong Kong recently introduced a licensing framework as many crypto-related businesses leave US shores. 
OSL announced it opened crypto trading services to retail investors, allowing them to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum. In a press release, the exchange said: 
“Effective immediately, OSL Digital Securities offers retail investors the ability to register on its platform and access digital asset products, starting with the popular cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).” 
Hong Kong has only issued a crypto license to OSL and Hashkey. Hashkey recently obtained its licence, allowing it to expand its services to retail consumers.

Binance Bitcoin Liquidity Takes a Dive Amid ETF Speculation Frenzy;"The post Binance Bitcoin Liquidity Takes a Dive Amid ETF Speculation Frenzy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Rumors can create ripples in even the most extensive ponds. On Monday, Binance, widely recognized as the globe’s top cryptocurrency exchange in trade volumes, experienced this first-hand. A sudden whirlwind of speculation, ignited by an unfounded social media rumor, led to a severe dip in the platform’s liquidity, leaving Binance traders in a more challenging spot than those on Kraken and Coinbase.
As shared by @KaikoData, a sudden evaporation of liquidity was observed right as volatility spiked.This underscores a prevalent strategy among market makers: Volatility Avoidance (2/5) pic.twitter.com/duNUaJ1YgR
The cryptocurrency market witnessed a frenzy when word spread like wildfire about BlackRock’s supposed spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) green light. This unfounded report swiftly fueled a surge, catapulting Bitcoin’s price by 7.5% to $30,000. However, the celebration was short-lived, as BlackRock soon refuted the claim, causing the crypto giant to relinquish its fleeting gains.
During this chaos, Binance’s 0.1% ask depth, a key indicator of buy-side liquidity, plummeted from 100 BTC to a mere 1.2 BTC, valued at $30,000. This significant drop wasn’t exclusive to Binance. Other major platforms like OKX and Bybit felt the squeeze, with their 0.1% depths bottoming to around 2 BTC. On average, significant exchanges saw their ask depth dive below 95 BTC.
The sudden evaporation of liquidity didn’t bode well for many in the crypto community. Traders, including noted names like exitpump and Omz, witnessed their investments erode due to slippage, some as drastically as 20%. Interestingly, Kraken and Coinbase showcased resilience during this liquidity storm, outshining Binance and other competitors.
This liquidity crisis isn’t the only challenge Binance is currently grappling with. Recently, in the aftermath of the October 7th Hamas attacks, Israeli authorities demanded a freeze on more than 100 accounts on Binance. This move aims to choke off the funding avenues of the Palestinian militant faction. As the authorities expand their probe, they seek details on an additional 200 crypto accounts, predominantly on Binance.
Last week, Binance acknowledged collaborating with Israeli officials to thwart terror financing. However, when pressed by the Financial Times about the exact number of accounts suspended, the firm remained tight-lipped, confirming only a “small number.”

The Aftermath of the False Bitcoin ETF Approval Report, Where’s BTC Headed Next? (Bitcoin Price Analysis);"Bitcoin’s price surprisingly spiked higher yesterday, closing above multiple significant resistance levels. However, the main obstacle, the $30K level, remains intact.
By Edris
On the daily chart, the price has been supported by the 50-day moving average located around the $27K mark. It has rebounded from this level since, aggressively breaking above both the $28K resistance level and the 200-day moving average near the same area.
While yesterday’s daily candle closed above these levels, it still closed with a very large wick to the upside. For investors to be optimistic that the $30K resistance zone is finally about to be broken, today’s daily candle must hold above the 200-day moving average. Otherwise, the recent move will be another bull trap, and the price will likely crash afterward.
It’s also worth noting that yesterday’s move was caused by an outlier event of a false report of an approved spot Bitcoin ETF.
The 4-hour chart shows that the price has broken through the $28K resistance level with some momentum, following a rebound from the $27K support zone. The market is currently retesting the broken $28K level and is holding above it. If the price does not fall back below this level, it would only be a matter of time before a rally toward the $30K resistance zone.
Meanwhile, the RSI indicator is showing a clear overbought signal, hinting at the probability of a fake breakout and a bearish reversal.

Bitcoin’s price suddenly spiked yesterday, approaching the key $30K resistance level once again.
This chart demonstrates the 100-day moving average of the taker buy-sell ratio metric. This metric measures whether buyers or sellers are executing their orders more aggressively. Values above 1 are considered bullish, while values below 1 are bearish.
It is evident that the taker buy-sell ratio metric has been trending below 1 for the last few months. However, with the recent surge in price, the metric is also rising higher. While still below 1, if this trend continues and the metric approaches 1 and eventually climbs higher, the market will likely enter a new bullish phase for the mid-term.

Bitcoin’s price surprisingly spiked higher yesterday, closing above multiple significant resistance levels. However, the main obstacle, the $30K level, remains intact.

XRP lawyer Deaton unveils SEC shift on spot Bitcoin ETF views;"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently showcased a noticeable change in its stance towards the much-anticipated spot Bitcoin ETF. At the center of these discussions stands lawyer John E. Deaton, a vocal advocate for the cryptocurrency industry.
Deaton’s remarks followed a post by analyst Scott Melker, widely recognized as “The Wolf Of All Street”. Reacting to Melker’s observations, Deaton firmly stated, “Scott is correct.” Moreover, Deaton had previously expressed skepticism, predicting the SEC might present an extensive report, full of data or anecdotal evidence, to once again deny a spot Bitcoin ETF application. This assumption was based on an earlier SEC decision that faced criticism from the Appellate Court for being arbitrary.
However, Deaton doesn’t necessarily credit this shift to a change in SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s perspective on Bitcoin. He noted that while Gensler can still criticize Bitcoin for potential associations with illicit activities, the SEC’s recent court losses, including the significant Grayscale lawsuit, likely impacted its stance.
Additionally, Deaton mentioned the “Larry Fink effect,” hinting at the influence of significant institutional players. Gensler prioritizes the opinions of donors and institutions over other stakeholders. Consequently, there’s a prevailing belief in the crypto community that Gensler might emulate the paths of former SEC Chair Jay Clayton and former SEC Director Bill Hinman, eyeing roles at leading institutions like Goldman or BlackRock post his SEC term.
Significantly, Bloomberg ETF analysts have illuminated the ongoing constructive dialogues between the SEC and Bitcoin ETF issuers. Topics of these discussions encompass crucial aspects like custodial arrangements, adherence to GAAP, risk disclosures, and the environmental concerns related to electricity consumption in mining. With these progressive talks, Bloomberg has upped the odds for a spot Bitcoin ETF approval to an optimistic 90%.
Besides the analysts, industry stalwarts are voicing their confidence, too. Notable figures like Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital and Cathie Wood from ARK Invest anticipate the SEC giving the green light to a spot Bitcoin ETF this year.

Bitcoin Price: Why $28,000 Could Hold The Key For Massive Bull Run;"The Bitcoin price experienced volatility in the last day following speculation about approving a spot BTC Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US. The rumors turned out false, but the cryptocurrency managed to reclaim a critical level. 
As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $28,460 with a 3% profit in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency recorded similar gains while other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market cap lagged the sudden rally except for Solana (SOL).
Data shared by the co-founders of analytics firm Glassnode highlights the importance of the recent rally. However, driven by what many in the crypto community called “fake news,” the upside momentum cleared some obstacles for the cryptocurrency.
In that sense, the data points to a generally positive sentiment around the Bitcoin ETF, which will continue to gain relevance in the coming months as uncertainty about its approval mitigates. The Glassnode co-founders stated via social media platform X:
While this pivotal milestone was momentarily attained on futures, the spot market price peaked at $27.98k earlier today. It’s evident just how crucial this price point is in the larger scheme (…). The rapid movements and these price thresholds aren’t just numbers. They signify investor sentiment, market dynamics.
The market activity surrounding the ETF rumors on some major crypto exchanges represented around 8% of their total trading volume. However, Bitcoin must hold its current level on the daily and weekly charts.
A separate analysis by a pseudonym trader claims that the recent Bitcoin price action broke out of a macro downtrend. As seen in the chart below, every time the cryptocurrency price breaks this trend, Bitcoin consolidates for a while before re-entering price discovery.
Despite the bullish momentum, Bitcoin can still touch critical support levels around $27,880 and $27,550 on short timeframes before resuming the rally. The Bitcoin price can go much lower on higher timeframes while maintaining its bullish structure. The analyst stated:
Bitcoin has long ago broken its Macro Downtrend. It’s undeniable that Bitcoin is in a Bull Market. The question is whether Bitcoin can perform a -30% retrace over the next 4-6 months or so. History suggests it can.

Cardano Creator Charles Hoskinson Says Game of Crypto vs. CBDCs Now Underway – Here’s What He Means;"Cardano (ADA) creator Charles Hoskinson says that the real battle in digital assets is now between cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).
In a new Coin Bureau interview, the chief executive of Input Output Global warns of the dangers of CBDCs and extolls the key principles of decentralized crypto.
“It’s not a game of Ethereum versus Cardano versus Algorand versus Solana. If you think that that’s the game, we’ve already lost. 
The game is crypto versus CBDCs. That’s the game. You know, there’s social credit and CBDCs for 1.2 billion people in China. It’s coming, and it’s already rolling it out. They already have a social credit to decide whether you get to ride the train, or get your passport or not. Well, it’s very trivial to say, ‘We’re going put that on your money now.’
And there are so many people in the ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) movement that say, ‘Hey, you’ve already filled up your car once this week, so we’re not going to let you buy gasoline until next week.’ They’re writing memos about how the single best way of preventing climate change is incentivizing climate-friendly behavior through the money system. 
So the minute they have a CBDC, transaction discrimination happens, and then it’s going to be discriminated on two different axes: what you do with it and who you are. And if you are part of a political minority that’s being persecuted, basically you get shut out of society. And if you’re doing things that the government structure with no oversight has decided, you don’t get to do that anymore. 
You’re basically you’re shut out of your money. It’s the dream of every despot, and it’s in real time for about a seventh of the entire world. And it’s going to come to Europe and America.”
Hoskinson says that legitimate crypto projects are the antithesis of CBDCs.
“The only way to get out of that is we have to go back to principles-based money and principles-based financial and economic systems. Every single cryptocurrency project that’s a real legitimate project is making contributions to fight that fight…
 But we’re all together. And the vindication will be the adoption of these principles and philosophies. It’s hard to say which particular protocol is going to win because all kinds of crazy things could happen in society.”

Top Ethereum (ETH)-Based Blockchain Oracle Altcoin Announces Next Steps in Staking Protocol Upgrade;"Blockchain oracle service Chainlink (LINK) has announced a coming upgrade to its staking mechanism.
Via the social media platform X, the oracle announced Chainlink Staking v0.2, which is currently being prepared with a new pool of 45 million LINK tokens.
The upgrade focuses on four main components, according to Chainlink: a new unbonding mechanism, stake slashing, a dynamic rewards system and a new modular architecture to ensure smoother future upgradability.
Unbonding is the period immediately after unstaking, where coins are typically locked on the blockchain for a certain amount of time before being released to users.
Stake slashing is when a staker’s coins are taken, or “slashed” by the network if they don’t follow certain rules or behave maliciously.
The migration to v0.2 is being launched in three phases that prioritize v.01 stakers.
Chainlink staking went live on the Ethereum mainnet in December of last year with the aim of enhancing the network’s security and helping it serve a bigger range of applications.
Says the Chainlink blog,
“Chainlink Staking is a key cryptoeconomic security mechanism in which stakers commit LINK tokens in smart contracts to back certain performance guarantees around oracle services. 
The addition of staking enables Chainlink decentralized oracle networks (DONs) to scale to service a broader range of applications and higher value use cases across Web3 and traditional Web2 industries.”

Polkadot (DOT) Price Prediction Amidst Billionaire Warnings and US Dollar Crisis;"The cryptocurrency market, already known for its wild fluctuations and unpredictability, is currently rife with anticipation. Speculations abound regarding a massive wave, potentially dwarfing any previous surges witnessed in major digital currencies. This isn't merely the result of whispers in niche crypto communities; it's a rumble heard in the very halls of Wall Street. Major players and institutional investors signal the influx of an astronomical sum of approximately $15.6 trillion into the crypto domain. 
With such an infusion, trading strategies would be revolutionized, and portfolios would be reshaped, placing renewed pressure on traditional financial systems. Billionaire magnates, recognizing potential tremors in the U.S. dollar's dominance, are hedging with assets like gold and Bitcoin. However, the market's sensitivity was recently underscored when a false report regarding the U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF approval triggered a short-lived pandemonium. Now, every gaze is fixed on the potential approval of a genuine bitcoin spot ETF, with giants from BlackRock to Grayscale positioning themselves to harness or defend against this tidal wave.
Those are the buzzwords around Polkadot (DOT) these days. As a major player in the blockchain domain, Parity Technologies' recent announcement of pivoting towards decentralization within the Polkadot ecosystem signifies a pivotal transformation not just for the company, but for the broader blockchain world. This change is expected to bring about organizational shifts and signals a transformative phase for the entire community. Its identity as a multi-chain protocol makes it distinct, fostering numerous debates ranging from its technical nuances to its place among blockchain platform behemoths. The question is, how does Polkadot fit into this volatile environment?
The recent changes in Parity Technologies indicate a bullish stance for Polkadot’s trajectory. Their move towards decentralization, aligned with Web3 Foundation's financial commitment of 20 million Swiss francs and 5 million DOT tokens, underscores the collective effort to bolster Polkadot’s growth strategies. With ecosystem expansion, Polkadot has also seen a rise in its staking metrics, and the creation of nomination pools is a testimony to its flourishing community. The record-breaking number of on-chain events, an increase in unique accounts, and robust development activity further paint a picture of a thriving ecosystem.
Polkadot (DOT) is currently hovering between $ 3.8996 and $4.3376, showing intriguing market dynamics. With a series of support and resistance levels backed by key turning points, the coin’s trajectory displays the potential for both bullish and bearish movements.
Starting with its support levels, Polkadot has seen the price pivot around the $6.24007 mark, representing a 61.8% retracement from the 52-week low. Additionally, there’s a 14 Day RSI (Relative Strength Index) level pegged at 80% corresponding to a price of $5.79181. This RSI level usually indicates that the asset might be in an overbought state and could experience a pullback. Another critical support rests at $5.73658, marking a 50% retracement from the 52-week high/low.
On the resistance front, DOT faces an immediate barrier at $7.61307 where the price intersects the 9-40 Day Moving Average. This is followed by the significant $9.37617 level where the price crosses the 18-40 Day Moving Average. Moreover, the coin's 52-week high stands at $7.87000, indicating a region of psychological importance.
If Polkadot (DOT) price maintains its momentum and crosses the $7.61307 mark (9-40 Day MA intersection), it has the potential to challenge its 52-week high of $7.87000. The next bullish threshold is the notable $9.37617 level, which, if breached, could push DOT into a robust upward rally.
However, should DOT falter and drop below the primary support of $6.24007, the coin might drift towards the subsequent support at $5.79181, signified by the 14 Day RSI at 80%. A further slide could pressure the coin towards $5.73658, the 50% retracement from the 52-week high/low.
There is no doubt that the crypto market is poised for major changes, and Polkadot's decentralized vision and growth metrics make it a coin worth watching. As with all investments, potential returns come hand-in-hand with risks. Thus, while the future shines bright for Polkadot, a balanced perspective considering both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios is essential for any savvy investor. In spite of DOT's exciting prospects, a holistic approach that takes into consideration both bullish and bearish scenarios will ensure a balanced approach for investors.

However, should DOT falter and drop below the primary support of $6.24007, the coin might drift towards the subsequent support at $5.79181, signified by the 14 Day RSI at 80%. A further slide could pressure the coin towards $5.73658, the 50% retracement from the 52-week high/low.
There is no doubt that the crypto market is poised for major changes, and Polkadot's decentralized vision and growth metrics make it a coin worth watching. As with all investments, potential returns come hand-in-hand with risks. Thus, while the future shines bright for Polkadot, a balanced perspective considering both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios is essential for any savvy investor. In spite of DOT's exciting prospects, a holistic approach that takes into consideration both bullish and bearish scenarios will ensure a balanced approach for investors.

Analysts Predict When the Rollercoaster Is Over for Ripple (XRP), Chainlink (LINK), Polygon (MATIC), and Polkadot (DOT);"Crypto markets have always been a rollercoaster of emotions and opportunities. The big chatter right now revolves around the potential approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs. Imagine a world where Bitcoin's market cap is about to get a whopping boost of $155 billion. Crazy, right? With major financial institutions lining up to roll out spot Bitcoin ETFs, this is becoming a reality we might soon experience. The implications are tremendous – Bitcoin could potentially become a $900 billion asset. And for the entire crypto market? It might expand by an unprecedented $1 trillion. If the markets were a movie, we'd be reaching the climax soon.
This exciting ride started when institutions began adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets during 2020-2021. The next anticipated wave seems to be these institutions giving their clients Bitcoin access via these ETFs. All these analyses and predictions remind us of the frenzied days of 2021 when the crypto market crossed the $1 trillion mark for the first time. Fast forward to now, and Bitcoin alone has a 50% stake in a total market cap of $1.13 trillion.

Ripple (XRP) Technical Analysis and Price Forecast

For those who've been tracking, the Ripple (XRP) price prediction on StealthEX offers a captivating insight. Ripple's historical performance outlines key levels that serve as markers for its potential direction.
Ripple's performance over the past year has demonstrated a series of significant support and resistance levels that can provide insights into its potential future trajectory. 
At the higher end, Ripple's 52-Week High is marked at $0.9223, and the 13-Week High is at $0.8517. Significant movements have been observed at the 9-18 Day Moving Average level of $0.6658 and the 9-40 Day Moving Average level of $0.6099. The 1-Month High stood at $0.5471, with resistance at the 40-Day Moving Average level of $0.5323.
Given these resistance points, the bullish forecast for XRPin the short-term would be to challenge the $0.5471 mark, and if momentum sustains, there's potential to test the 13-Week High. Strong upward momentum could even push XRP towards its 52-Week High at $0.9223.
On the flip side, XRP has established key support areas that have been tested multiple times. The initial support point is at $0.4829, followed by the level at $0.4774.
The bearish scenario would see XRP retest the mentioned immediate support level. Should this level fail to hold, it could decline further towards the 13-Week Low of $0.4596. A prolonged bearish phase could potentially drive it down to its 52-Week Low of $0.3166.
To sum up, the technical data provides two potential paths for XRP. Its future price movement will likely depend on broader market sentiment, adoption rates, and potential regulatory updates. 
So, there's a bit of a tug of war happening here. And if you're thinking of playing the XRP game, make sure to exchange USDT to XRP on StealthEX. Almost any crypto you can imagine can be swapped on their platform in just one click without signing up or KYC. 
Chainlink has its unique story to tell in the crypto verse. Its decentralized oracles have been a game-changer. But what's the price saying?
From the bullish camp, there's noticeable enthusiasm as LINK approaches significant resistance levels. With momentum on its side, there's potential for LINK to challenge its 13-Week High of $8.4270. If this bullish fervor continues, LINK could even aim for the 52-Week High of $9.2130.
On the flip side, a bearish undertone can't be ignored. While the price has managed to hold above some levels, there are key support areas LINK might test if bearish sentiments persist. The primary support to watch is the support point at $7.0843. If this level doesn't hold, the next significant support is at $6.8907.
Dipping below these levels might signal a more prolonged bearish trend, potentially dragging LINK closer to the 1-Month Low of $6.5190 or even further.
LINK appears to be in the midst of a pivotal moment in its journey. Whether it scales new highs or tests its supports will hinge on overall market sentiment, adoption of decentralized oracles, and possibly broader crypto trends. For those considering getting aboard the LINK express, here's your chance to exchange USDT to LINK KYC-free.
Polygon (MATIC), recognized for its scalability solutions, has generated significant buzz. But is its price trajectory mirroring its technological advancements?
A closer examination of MATIC's price movements suggests bullish undercurrents, given its trajectory above several day moving averages. Nevertheless, one can't ignore the challenges it faced, particularly stalling around the 40-day moving average.
For the optimists among us, the resistance levels, specifically the immediate resistance at $0.54338 and the next resistance at $0.55127, seem within reach, considering recent bullish signs. Those with a bullish outlook might anticipate MATIC making strides towards its 52-week high, set at $1.56580.
However, those on the cautious side would emphasize the coin's struggles, particularly as it neared the 52-week low of $0.49302. Additionally, looking at the support levels, MATIC's immediate support stands at $0.50368, with the next support level positioned at $0.49172. Should the price fall and challenge these points, it might serve as an indication of bearish momentum.
If Polygon piques your interest, don’t miss out on the opportunity to exchange USDT to MATIC at the best rates right now.

Polkadot (DOT) Technical Analysis and Price Forecast

Polkadot (DOT) has been experiencing quite the movement in the markets, and the technical analysis reveals some interesting patterns and levels that traders might want to keep an eye on.
From a resistance standpoint, the immediate resistance is pegged at the $3.86575 range, and the next significant resistance level stands at $3.91926. Given the current market conditions, should DOT maintain its bullish momentum, these are the key resistance levels it might challenge in the short-term.
On the downside, the immediate support stands at $3.56763. This is an essential level to watch as it could serve as a potential floor should DOT experience any pullbacks. Further below, the next support level is at $3.47208. Breaching this could signal a more extended bearish trend, and DOT might see lower price levels.
While Polkadot’s price range suggests potential volatility, broader market conditions, developments within the Polkadot ecosystem, and overall cryptocurrency trends will play a significant role in its future trajectory.
In conclusion, whether you're an investor or a trader, the crypto market, and specifically coins like DOT, present various opportunities. Remember always to assess risks, stay updated with the latest news, and base your decisions on comprehensive research. 
Don't miss out on the opportunity to take advantage of the potential gains in the Polkadot market – exchange USDT to DOT now! 
The crypto market remains as unpredictable as ever. But with unpredictability comes opportunity. Whether you're a bull or a bear, the current market conditions promise a lot of action. As always, it's crucial to do your research, stay informed, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Near Protocol Price Prediction 2023, 2024, 2025: Will NEAR Price Hit $2.0 This Year?;"The post Near Protocol Price Prediction 2023, 2024, 2025: Will NEAR Price Hit $2.0 This Year? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News

The global crypto market has been generous enough to emerging protocols and its native assets. A number of sprouting protocols have managed to establish their reign in the industry. One such is the Near Protocol, which has been growing in prominence. The network’s traits such as higher transaction speeds, climate neutrality, and lower transaction fees have been adding feathers to its superiority.
NEAR is the native asset of the Near Protocol, which is used for activities like completing transactions on the network. For participating in the staking procedures and governance procedures, amongst others. The altcoin holds an ROI of 246.47%.
Are you considering NEAR for your portfolio, but doubtful of its returns? Look no further, as we decode the possible price prediction of NEAR for 2023 – 2025 and the years to come!

The RSI has displayed a sharp fall in its averages, indicating a massive ongoing buying and selling pressure. Moreover, the averages show a straight fall, suggesting the price to continue falling this week.
If a bulls take over bears in terms of scalability, transaction throughputs, decentralization, and lower transaction costs, it could increase transaction volumes. Which could push the altcoin price to $1.034 soon. Further, if the market continues to gain momentum then the price will make a run and test its upper resistance of $1.070 in the coming days. 
On the flip side, if the bulls fail to hold the price above the crucial support level of $1, the price will lose momentum and fall to new lows and also lose its $1 mark.
Since February, NEAR has continued to trade in a descending channel displaying a bearish influence. The coin has erased all its gains from the price surge the market had experienced at the start of this year. The bulls are struggling hard to hold the price.
The RSI is struggling to breach its mid-point since the ending of July and has repeatedly failed to cross it, indicating a long bear power in the market.

Elon Musk Brands Fiat Currency a Scam: Is Bitcoin Back on the Billionaire’s Radar?;"
According to a recent statement made by Elon Musk, it appears that the billionaire is not the biggest fan of fiat currencies. 
Elon Musk, the current CEO of X, formerly Twitter, has said little to nothing about cryptocurrencies over the past months. However, in a recent post, the billionaire sets the records straight on where he stands with traditional assets.
In a response post, Musk clarified that fiat currencies are not as valuable to him as they might be to others. He refers to fiat as a scam that has been deeply ingrained in the financial system, so much so that it is no longer seen as the inferior asset that it is. 
His response was a reply to a post that reads: “What’s a scam that’s so normalized that we don’t even realize it’s a scam anymore.” 
His position on fiat does not contrast with other cryptocurrency proponents, who are more inclined to believe that digital currencies are superior. However, with fiat being a globally adopted currency, it has been the most popular and most used currency for several years. 
It is also worth noting that fiat has been one of crypto’s major competitors, with many regulatory figures from different parts of the world referring to digital currencies as the leading threat for fiat. 
Meanwhile, the Bitcoin community interprets Musk’s tweet as a pointer to his position on the Bitcoin market. While some imply that the tweet speaks to the fact that the billionaire is still big on crypto, others are convinced that the crypto in question is Bitcoin.
The second sentiment is largely shared by market players who are convinced that the timing of Musk’s post was a strategy. Notably, Bitcoin was in the middle of a rally at the time. The apex cryptocurrency saw its value surge past the $28,000 price mark briefly before losing momentum. 
During the time of this report, Bitcoin is trading at a time of $28,247. The asset has recorded hourly surges while sustaining over 4% of its gains over the last 7 days.
On the other hand, trading volume has dropped by 29%, as Bitcoin remains 59% below its all-time high of $68,789.

Canadian asset manager 3iQ will begin staking the ETH in its Ethereum ETFs;"3iQ, Canada’s first Bitcoin (BTC) fund issuer, revealed that its Ethereum-based (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETF), The Ether Fund and the 3iQ Ether Fund, will begin staking their ETH holdings for rewards, according to an Oct. 19 statement.
3iQ explained that its move towards staking was designed to provide its investors with “additional yield generated by dedicated validators on the Ethereum network’s Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism while eliminating the complexities of directly handling digital assets.”
“The Funds will earn rewards in the form of ETH, which will be reflected in the net asset value (NAV) of the Funds through accretive yield,” the firm said.
Data from 3iQ’s website shows that the two funds have a combined net asset value of around $130 million.
To incentivize investors, 3iQ said it would waive the management fee of the 3iQ Ether ETF until March 31, 2024, and the fund would be renamed “3iQ Ether Staking ETF” from Oct. 20.
Meanwhile, 3iQ said it will “exclusively use” Coinbase Custody’s institutional staking infrastructure. Per the statement, its ETH is held custodied with Coinbase Custody, with oversight provided by Tetra Trust.
The asset manager did not specify how much of its portfolio would be staked. However, it stated that it would “adopt a measured approach to the Staking Activities, taking into account the liquidity needs of the Fund and the novelty of the investment strategy.”
3iQ further revealed that it would charge 25% of the staked rewards generated by the Funds as Staking Service Fee. The firm clarified that this fee would only be deducted from rewards generated by the Staking Activities.
Staking is an integral part of the Ethereum blockchain network that involves committing at least 32 ETH to support the network for a set period to earn rewards. Ethereum’s website describes the process as “a public good” that “keeps Ethereum secure for everyone.” According to the website, ETH stakers will earn 3.5% rewards annually.
Data from Beaconscan shows that the total number of staked ETH has grown to 27.8 million during the last six months despite the introduction of the Shanghai update, which allowed withdrawals from the beacon chain.

Blackrock CEO Larry Fink Sees Global Demand and ‘Pent-up Interest in Crypto’ Amid Israel-Hamas War;"Larry Fink, the CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock, sees the recent bitcoin rally as “an example of the pent-up interest in crypto.” Noting that as the Israel-Hamas war rages on, more people will be running to bitcoin as “a flight to quality,” the executive emphasized: “We are hearing from clients around the world about the need for crypto.”
Blackrock CEO Larry Fink offered his perspective on the bitcoin rally Monday following a rumor that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved his company’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application.
While emphasizing that he cannot discuss “the specifics of anything,” Fink said on Fox Business:
I think it’s just an example of the pent-up interest in crypto. We are hearing from clients around the world about the need for crypto.
The rumor was spread by crypto news outlet Cointelegraph which posted on social media platform X early Monday morning that the SEC had approved Blackrock’s spot bitcoin ETF. The news outlet later retracted the story. Bitcoin spiked nearly 10% before dropping back to the $28,000 level after the fake news report.
Noting that “Some of this rally is way beyond the rumor,” the Blackrock CEO stressed:
I think the rally today is about a flight to quality, with all the issues around the Israeli war now, [and] global terrorism. And I think there’s more people running to a flight to quality — whether that is in Treasurys, gold, or crypto, depending on how you think about it.
Blackrock filed an application for Ishares Bitcoin Trust, a spot bitcoin ETF, with the SEC in June. If approved by the SEC, the trust will use Coinbase Custody as its custodian. In July, Fink said crypto will transcend any one currency.
A growing number of financial institutions have filed for approval to launch spot bitcoin ETFs with the SEC. However, none have been approved. Last month, several U.S. lawmakers urged the SEC to immediately approve spot bitcoin ETF applications. Steven Schoenfeld, former head of International Equity Product Strategy at Barclays Global Investors expects the SEC to approve all bitcoin ETF applications within three to six months. On Friday, the deadline for the SEC to appeal the circuit court decision regarding Grayscale Investments’ application to convert its bitcoin trust (GBTC) to a spot bitcoin ETF expired without the SEC appealing.

"Crypto Market Analysis: End Of Bear Market is Near; When Will Bitcoin & Altcoins Bounce Back?";"The post Crypto Market Analysis: End Of Bear Market is Near; When Will Bitcoin & Altcoins Bounce Back? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Amid economic uncertainty in the United States, Bitcoin (BTC) has emerged as a pillar of stability, surging to an intra-day high of $28,516. This surge is significant, especially considering the prevailing macroeconomic challenges in the US, which have been casting a shadow on investor sentiment. Notably, this surge aligns with a historical pattern observed in Bitcoin’s price movements.
Historically, around the 17-19 month mark of a bear market, Bitcoin tends to reach the 50% retracement level of its previous bear market. In this case, that level is approximately $42,000, calculated from Bitcoin’s bear market low of $3,850. This pattern provides a potential price target for Bitcoin in its ongoing cycle, offering valuable insights for traders and investors.
Meanwhile, renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe, with a substantial following on Twitter, offered an encouraging perspective on altcoins. He noted that while the bear market has been trying for altcoin holders, there is light at the end of the tunnel. According to him, altcoins are currently in the final phase of the bear cycle, and though it may feel painful, it signifies a turning point. 
#Altcoins are in the last part of the bear cycle. Yes, it feels relatively painful. The sentiment is completely gone, no interest in crypto. The only thing moving is #Bitcoin and, yet, that one needs to crack some levels. The end is near for the bear market. Read here… pic.twitter.com/TLijWdMNKF
In his analysis, Bitcoin has been the primary cryptocurrency, displaying noteworthy price movements recently. Nevertheless, analysts pointed out that altcoins like Chainlink and Solana have already started their upward trajectory regarding Bitcoin value. On the flip side, Ethereum faces challenges due to unmet expectations surrounding the ETH ETF Futures launch.
Significant events are on the horizon, potentially reshaping the crypto landscape. Van de Poppe emphasizes that this bear market for altcoins has been notably prolonged, spanning approximately 29 months. The Bitcoin halving and the potential introduction of a spot ETF are pivotal factors. Plus, he anticipates that geopolitical turbulence, which has already driven up the value of Gold, could further bolster Bitcoin’s position. 
“If you ask on the streets, people will not be saying that crypto is massive. That will happen in a year or a few years, time again. Right now, people assume that we’ll be going down with the markets massively again, just like we’ve been seeing in 2019. Technically, N=1,” he reasoned.
While sentiment on the streets might not currently echo the magnitude of crypto’s impact, van de Poppe believes a shift is on the horizon. He suggests that people’s perception of the crypto market will likely transform in the coming years, potentially mirroring the developments observed in 2015/2016. This period saw a slow but consistent upward trajectory leading up to the Bitcoin halving, marking a turning point for altcoins. Bitcoin is currently at $ 28,280.86, down by -0.74% in the last 24 hours.

Tether freezes over $873,000 connected to ‘terrorism and illegal warfare’ in Israel and Ukraine;"Tether, the global leader in stablecoin issuance, has bolstered its collaboration with law enforcement agencies worldwide. Aiming to stifle cryptocurrency-fueled terrorism and illegal warfare, the company has been notably proactive. To date, its efforts have aided 31 agencies across 19 international jurisdictions, freezing assets valued at approximately $835 million. Moreover, these actions have largely focused on theft-related incidents and a fraction on other crimes.
According to a report by Tether, nations benefiting from Tether’s cooperation are Brazil, Singapore, Philippines, Germany, South Korea, and many others spanning multiple continents. Recently, the company froze 32 addresses connected to terrorism and illegal warfare in Israel and Ukraine. These addresses held a combined amount of $873,118.34. Besides its global outreach, Tether is also working closely with Israel’s National Bureau for Counter-Terror Financing (NBCTF) to mitigate risks associated with cryptocurrency in terrorism and warfare.
Despite the skepticism surrounding cryptocurrency’s role in crime, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino offers a different narrative. “Cryptocurrency transactions are not anonymous. They are the most traceable and trackable assets,” Ardoino clarified. According to him, every transaction is registered on the blockchain, making fund tracking straightforward. Consequently, criminals using cryptocurrency are bound to face the repercussions sooner or later.
Even though cybercrime poses a $445 billion burden on the global economy, Tether’s actions manifest the inherent advantages of blockchain technology. The transparency and traceability of blockchain transactions act as effective deterrents against illegal activities. Hence, Tether’s efforts emphasize not only the reactive capabilities of law enforcement but also the proactive measures that the cryptocurrency industry can deploy against crime.
Since Russia’s invasion last year, crypto has been widely used in Ukraine. After appealing for donations, Kyiv managed to raise over $100 million in crypto. According to blockchain researcher Chainalysis, pro-Russian groups have also utilized crypto for funding in eastern Ukraine.
However, Tether’s ongoing collaboration with global agencies paints a different picture. It highlights a committed effort to augment the fight against terrorism, theft, and other illicit activities. The company foresees a sustained partnership with law enforcement agencies globally as part of its allegiance to financial integrity and global security.
Tether’s increased involvement in thwarting illegal activities comes in the wake of disturbing trends identified by U.S. blockchain analysis firm TRM Labs. In a February blog, TRM pointed out a 240% surge in the use of Tether among entities engaged in terrorist financing. This figure starkly contrasts an 80% rise in the use of Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency. Despite the alarming stats, Tether remains unyielding in its resolve to work closely with global agencies, thereby raising the bar for the entire crypto industry in crime prevention.
Cryptopolitan reported last week that the Israeli police suspended cryptocurrency accounts used to request contributions for Hamas through social media platforms. Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7 killed 1,300 people.

Since Russia’s invasion last year, crypto has been widely used in Ukraine. After appealing for donations, Kyiv managed to raise over $100 million in crypto. According to blockchain researcher Chainalysis, pro-Russian groups have also utilized crypto for funding in eastern Ukraine.
However, Tether’s ongoing collaboration with global agencies paints a different picture. It highlights a committed effort to augment the fight against terrorism, theft, and other illicit activities. The company foresees a sustained partnership with law enforcement agencies globally as part of its allegiance to financial integrity and global security.
Tether’s increased involvement in thwarting illegal activities comes in the wake of disturbing trends identified by U.S. blockchain analysis firm TRM Labs. In a February blog, TRM pointed out a 240% surge in the use of Tether among entities engaged in terrorist financing. This figure starkly contrasts an 80% rise in the use of Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency. Despite the alarming stats, Tether remains unyielding in its resolve to work closely with global agencies, thereby raising the bar for the entire crypto industry in crime prevention.
Cryptopolitan reported last week that the Israeli police suspended cryptocurrency accounts used to request contributions for Hamas through social media platforms. Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7 killed 1,300 people.

Fidelity Investments Submits Revised Spot Bitcoin ETF Proposal To SEC — Here’s What’s New;"
Fidelity Investments has become the latest firm to file a revised version of its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal. This latest move signals the asset management giant’s commitment to giving its customers exposure to the premier cryptocurrency.
Boston-based investment behemoth Fidelity has filed a second amended application for its spot Bitcoin ETF, the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust.
Now Fidelity has filed an amended application. Three issuers down, six-ish to go.. https://t.co/47Aw37MDTa
The latest version, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 17, specifies how it will safeguard customers’ Bitcoin holdings in custody accounts and reveals risks related to the rocky regulatory backdrop around crypto assets, among other minor adjustments.
Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart said the changes are an indication of ongoing active dialogues between prospective ETF issuers and the SEC.
“More proof that potential spot Bitcoin ETF issuers are in communication with SEC regarding changes/amendments required for SEC to consider approving,” Seyffart said. “Positive signs IMO.”
The revised submission from Fidelity follows Ark Invest and Invesco, which also recently revamped their spot bitcoin ETF applications. Invesco submitted its revised prospectus on October 11, and Ark Invest a day later.
The SEC recently failed to appeal its August court loss over Grayscale’s bid to convert its flagship GBTC fund into a spot BTC ETF, igniting some hope among investors that the SEC might greenlight the application.
Speculation of a spot-based Bitcoin ETF being approved by the regulator mounted on Monday, pushing the Bitcoin price to $30,000. The reports turned out to be fake as BlackRock revealed that its filing was still being reviewed by the SEC. Nonetheless, BlackRock boss Larry Fink suggested that the recent Bitcoin price rally showed investors’ “pent-up” interest in cryptocurrencies. 
Meanwhile, Bloomberg analysts believe spot Bitcoin ETFs have a 90% chance of being allowed to launch by January 2024.
If the SEC approves these spot ETF applications, it could become a strong driver for the crypto industry, bringing in a new era of institutional investment and trustworthiness.

Amsterdam Conference Exposes Bitcoin’s Battle for Agreement;"The recent Bitcoin Amsterdam conference brought to the forefront the ongoing challenges within the Bitcoin ecosystem when it comes to reaching a consensus on key protocol improvement proposals. Bitcoin’s development history has seen its fair share of controversies, including the infamous block size debate. This time, the focus was on Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), with a heated panel discussion that underscored the difficulties in achieving consensus.
During the conference, two veteran Bitcoin developers, Paul Sztorc and Peter Todd, engaged in a fiery discussion about the ongoing development of Drivechains, a project led by Sztorc’s LayerTwo Labs. Sztorc has dedicated nearly six years to the development of BIP-300, which advocates for the creation of layer-2 sidechains to address various issues without necessitating fundamental changes to the Bitcoin protocol. The debate between the two developers was at times acrimonious, with Todd often talking over Sztorc. This disagreement highlighted the substantial challenges involved in achieving consensus on BIPs aimed at enhancing the overall functionality of the Bitcoin protocol.
Jameson Lopp, co-founder and chief technology officer of Bitcoincustody firm Casa, expressed his concerns about the deceleration in the pace of protocol improvements and changes. According to Lopp, the recent emergence of projects like BitVM and SpiderChain offers a glimmer of hope for the protocol’s future. He believes that a few proposed soft forks may prove beneficial in bolstering the Bitcoin protocol’s capabilities. Lopp emphasizes the importance of enabling functionality that enhances Bitcoin’s role as a cryptographic accumulator and the effectiveness of second layers.
He also notes that a previous stance advocating for “hardcore ossification” within the Bitcoin community would have stifled innovation. Lopp points to examples such as the Lightning Network, which relies on specific BIPs like OP_CLTV and OP_CSV for its functionality. These BIPs were introduced as soft forks and have been instrumental in enabling Lightning Network’s success.
Lopp acknowledges that while a lack of consensus on base layer improvement proposals may lead to a relatively static Bitcoin protocol, developers are likely to explore alternative avenues for improvement that don’t require major protocol changes. In such cases, solutions tend to be “bolted-on” to the existing framework, allowing for incremental progress.
He underscores that for Bitcoin to continue scaling, it is imperative to avoid a scenario where users increasingly rely on a handful of custodians and exchanges, effectively transforming Bitcoin into a system of IOUs. Such a future, Lopp argues, would be far from ideal and not aligned with the aspirations of the Bitcoin community.
The Bitcoin Amsterdam conference also shed light on the increasing importance of Bitcoin’s value proposition and its attributes as “hard money” during an extended bear market. These qualities, often associated with Bitcoin’s limited supply and decentralized nature, continue to be a driving force behind its adoption and use.
The recent Bitcoin Amsterdam conference showcased the ongoing challenges faced by the Bitcoin community when it comes to reaching a consensus on critical protocol improvement proposals.

Guide to the Best NFT Marketplaces for 2023;"In the ever-evolving world of digital art and collectibles, NFTs have taken center stage. As we step into 2023, several platforms have risen to prominence, offering artists, collectors, and enthusiasts a space to buy, sell, and explore unique digital assets. Here’s a comprehensive guide to the top 5 NFT marketplaces this year.
An NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace is a digital platform where users can create, buy, sell, and trade NFTs. Unlike regular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-for-one basis, NFTs are unique and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis. This uniqueness and rarity are what give NFTs their value, and marketplaces are the hubs where these transactions occur.
NFT marketplaces operate on blockchain technology, ensuring the authenticity and ownership of digital assets. When an artist or creator mints an NFT, it’s recorded on the blockchain with a unique identifier. This ensures that every NFT is one-of-a-kind. Buyers can then purchase these NFTs on the marketplace, and the ownership details get updated on the blockchain. The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures transparency, security, and immutability of each transaction.
Blur has emerged as a leading NFT platform in 2023, known for its user-friendly interface and a diverse range of digital assets. Catering to both seasoned collectors and newcomers, Blur offers a seamless experience, from minting to trading. Its unique feature is the integration of immersive AR (Augmented Reality) experiences, allowing users to interact with their NFTs in a virtual space.
LooksRare has carved a niche for itself by focusing on exclusive, high-end digital art pieces. With a rigorous vetting process, only the most exceptional artworks make it to the platform. LooksRare also offers advanced analytics tools, giving collectors insights into the value and potential appreciation of their assets. Their royalty system ensures artists continue to earn from secondary sales, promoting a sustainable creator ecosystem.
A veteran in the NFT space, OpenSea continues to dominate in 2023. Its vast and diverse marketplace boasts everything from art and music to domain names and virtual real estate. OpenSea‘s open protocol allows for seamless integration with other platforms, making it a preferred choice for many. Their user-friendly interface, combined with robust security features, ensures both creators and collectors have a top-notch experience.
Magic Eden has risen to prominence in 2023 for its focus on the Solana blockchain. With lightning-fast transactions and minimal gas fees, it offers an efficient and cost-effective platform for NFT enthusiasts. Magic Eden also emphasizes community engagement, with regular events, drops, and collaborations, making it a vibrant hub for the Solana NFT community.
Rarible stands out for its decentralized approach to the NFT space. It empowers its community by allowing them to vote on platform upgrades and changes. Rarible’s focus on creator autonomy and its unique “RARI” token for governance has made it a favorite among independent artists and creators. With a strong emphasis on innovation, Rarible continues to introduce features that set it apart in the crowded NFT marketplace scene.
In conclusion, 2023 has seen the NFT space explode with innovation, creativity, and growth. Whether you’re an artist, collector, or just a curious enthusiast, these platforms offer a gateway into the mesmerizing world of NFTs. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, these marketplaces will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital art and collectibles.

Trader Says There’s No Support for Altcoin That’s Exploded Over 285% in a Month, Predicts More Pain Looming;"A crypto trader is issuing a warning on a low-cap altcoin that has enjoyed triple-digit price appreciation in a month.
Pseudonymous crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 196,900 followers on the X social media platform that the decentralized applications (DApps) platform Loom Network (LOOM) is “on the way down” after experiencing “fast bull moves” over the past 30 days.
LOOM rose from its September 19th close of $0.0462 to a five-year high of $0.407 earlier this week.
According to Altcoin Sherpa, LOOM could rise modestly over the short term before resuming the downtrend and inflicting “more pain” as it lacks “any support.”
LOOM is trading at trading at $0.179 at time of writing, up by around 287% from its September 19th price of $0.0462.
Turning to Bitcoin, Altcoin Sherpa says that he is bullish on the flagship crypto asset over the short term.
“BTC: I think that this is going to go higher and fill out this inefficiency (price rising drastically and falling just as fast resulting in long candles and wicks). $30,200 is a one-million-dollar level. Funding negative, you know what that means…
I still have zero clarity on where BTC is going in the midterm.”
A negative funding rate means there are more short positions than long positions on Bitcoin, which some traders perceive to be a bullish indicator.
BTC is worth $28,420 at time of writing.

False ETF rumor causes a plummet in Bitcoin’s liquidity on Binance;"The crypto market has been marked by inherent volatility, and the recent sentiments on Bitcoin have centered the asset as an unpredictable digital currency. A clear incident of this is the recent soaring of its price, which was unprecedented and later plummeting just as fast. 
This was a result of a false publication on the X platform on Monday that caused price shifts in the market. One significant aspect to consider in dealing with cryptocurrencies is liquidity. Liquidity refers to the ease with which digital assets can be bought or sold in the crypto market without causing a significant change in price or fluctuation. 
Bitcoin’s liquidity is among the assets to take into consideration in the Binance exchange platform. It has faced many challenges, one being the notable ETF rumored incident on Monday. The misinformation caused a rollercoaster of Bitcoin’s price. 
Binance is well known for its reliability as it has listed over 340 cryptocurrencies and allows trading and exchange of these digital assets. It is the world’s largest digital currency exchange by trading volume. 
Amidst the spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) rumors, Bitcoin traders on Binance were at a disadvantage compared to traders on other prominent exchange platforms like Coinbase and Kraken. This was according to the Parise-based Kaiko, the leading crypto market data provider. 
According to the Kaiko order book data, Kraken’s and Coinbase’s (COIN) liquidity outperformed Binance amidst the liquidity meltdown. Binance’s ask and bid depth were extremely lower than the other top exchanges, and this was a huge disadvantage to traders on the BNB platform. 
The 0.1 measure of buy-side liquidity on Binance crashed to 1.2 BTC, valued at $30,000. This was a significant drop from 100 BTC. Moreover, this caused a volatile explosion in the Bitcoin price caused by the false report. The 0.1% ask depth is the number of pending buy orders that are within the 0.1% of the average between the bid and ask price. 
Simply put, the higher the ask depth and bid price, the more efficient it is to proceed with large sell orders and execute large buy orders as well. This is advantageous since it’s done at stable prices with lower slippage. It refers to the difference between the digital currency’s actual price and the expected price where trades are placed. 
The false information caused the BTC price to peak close to the $30,000 mark, causing a 7.5% rise. This was corrected after the gains dropped almost as quickly as when the report was denied by BlackRock and the SEC. The false report on X by Cointelegraph stated the approval of the BlackRock (BLK) iShare spot ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
The result of this false information was the liquidation of long orders that were corrected and caused traders to lose their trades due to margin calls. Moreover, some traders recorded huge slippage that was as high as 20%. It attests to the highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, on the Binance crypto exchange. 
Leading up to the price surge and liquidity fluctuation was untrue information about the SEC’s approval of the spot BTC ETF. This misinformation caused a shift in liquidity provision, impacted the trading Bitcoin experience, and affected Binance’s liquidity drop. 
The sudden spike caused a surge in trading volume and strained the platform’s infrastructure. As a result, it affected its order books and, in turn, significantly raised slippage. 
However, the recent report by Kaiko on the liquidity data could also affect the entire crypto market, either positively or negatively.

Tesla Is Not Selling Bitcoin: Another Reason To Double-Down And Buy More?;"The electric car manufacturer Tesla is proving to be yet another Bitcoin (BTC) HODLer. Their Q3 2023 earnings report indicates that Elon Musk’s automotive company held onto its coins, not liquidating coins over the last few quarters.
Although Tesla has not bought any Bitcoin since February 2021, even selling 75% of its holdings in April 2022 at a loss, the technology firm has chosen not to sell despite recent market gyrations. By November 2021, prices soared to over $69,000 but fell months later to $16,000 in 2022.
In February 2021, Tesla bought $1.5 billion of Bitcoin, acquiring around 43,000 BTC. Around the same time, the automaker said it would accept the coin for payment before reneging on its comments weeks later.
It should be noted that Tesla’s report didn’t mention Bitcoin in their Q3 2023 report. Therefore, it is doubtful that the company made any changes, additions, or liquidation of their coins. However, it is unclear how much Bitcoin the company holds as of press time. According to the last earning reports of Q2 2023, Tesla held around $184 million of the coin. The exact figure also fluctuates, considering the volatile nature of crypto assets.

Even so, parallel Bitcoin Treasuries data shows that Tesla is among the biggest holders of the coin. With 9,720 BTC worth over $277 million at current prices, the company is the third largest public firm after MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm; and Mara Digital, a Bitcoin miner. MicroStrategy has been accumulating Bitcoin, buying more coins in 2022 when prices crashed to around $16,000. 
Other notable public companies and coin holders include Coinbase, the crypto exchange operator; Riot Blockchain– a miner; and Galaxy Digital, a crypto venture capital. Another public firm, Meitu, holds Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). However, it recently declared its intention to sell and refocus its efforts on artificial intelligence. 
As a public company, Tesla is legally obligated to disclose its finances to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the primary regulator in the United States. This means that the company must also make public all material information to its investors, including its financial health, the status of its operations, and the risks it could face.
This disclosure of crypto holdings seems to be the standard despite the agency not mandating public companies to do so. Even so, the regulator only requires firms it oversees to disclose information they consider necessary to investors. In publicly disclosing their BTC holdings, Tesla makes known the financial impact their coins have.

A Comparison Between Ethereum (ETH) And Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) In the Context of 2023;"Expanding your portfolio is one of the ways to get more from your investments.
That said, it’s also worth looking at other potentially opportunistic cryptocurrencies. That said, crypto experts suggest you can maximize your crypto earnings by spreading your investment across Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Spark (BTCS).
Ethereum is a groundbreaking blockchain platform that was introduced in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin. What set Ethereum apart from its predecessors was its support for smart contracts ingenious self-executing programs designed to activate when specific conditions are met.
This revolutionary technology empowered developers to create applications within its secure blockchain environment, laying the foundation for the expansive realm of decentralized applications (DApps).
Ethereum’s pioneering role in supporting smart contracts and decentralized applications has undeniably solidified its position in the blockchain landscape. The fact that it commands more than half of the share of the burgeoning DeFi sector is a clear indicator of the strong demand for ETH tokens. Notably, ETH is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization.
Additionally, Ethereum’s ongoing efforts to enhance scalability, security, and overall efficiency, such as its transition to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, demonstrate a commitment to addressing critical challenges. Furthermore, the recent approval of several Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) signifies growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency.
While Ethereum’s price has experienced fluctuations and is currently substantially below its all-time high, these factors collectively indicate a surge might be on the horizon.
Bitcoin Spark is an emerging blockchain poised to usher in a new era of digital transactions. The blockchain boasts a high transaction throughput and low fees, enabled by a high individual block transaction capacity, a low block time, and a massive number of nodes. Bitcoin Spark also offers a robust infrastructure for smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps), featuring a dedicated smart contract layer with distinct execution systems that all settle on the primary network. This architecture ensures scalability and allows for a range of programming languages, promoting diversity.
Distinctively, Bitcoin Spark employs a proprietary consensus mechanism known as the Proof-of-Process (PoP). This innovative mechanism rewards users nonlinearly for validating blocks and contributing their processing power to the network. The nonlinear rewards, combined with the network’s extensive node network, facilitate a large number of validators. Excitingly, the Bitcoin Spark team will launch a network validation application compatible with Windows, Android, iOS, Linux, and Mac OS devices.

The Bitcoin Spark network will offer individuals and organizations seeking remote computing power an opportunity to effectively and securely use the validators’ contributed power in exchange for BTCS. Network validators will receive 97% of the revenue generated in addition to newly minted BTCS and transaction fees from confirmed blocks.
Moreover, Bitcoin Spark opens doors for advertising through ad slots on its application and website, which will also be paid for in BTCS. The ads will be subject to community oversight to ensure credibility while upholding decentralization principles. Network participants receive 50% of the generated revenue, with additional incentives for those involved in ad oversight.
Notably, Bitcoin Spark is in Phase 7 of 10 in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with BTCS priced at $3 and investors receiving a 7% bonus, among other benefits. The ICO has raised more than $2.75 million, and the team has made significant steps to ensure and assure the security of the invested assets.
Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) is set to launch from ICO at $10 on November 30th. Some analysts have come out to comment on this crypto and its potential for growth and adoption.
They suggest that its innovative technology, real-world applications, and multiple reward systems could attract many users and create demand for BTCS.
They also point to the supply of 21 million BTCS coins, which mimics the scarcity factor that has led to significant price appreciation for Bitcoin (BTC). Additionally, Bitcoin Spark’s low market capitalization and launch timing, which is just before the next predicted bull run are also some things to consider.

TWT Price Analysis: With TWT Above $1, Will Bulls Touch $1.35?;"The post TWT Price Analysis: With TWT Above $1, Will Bulls Touch $1.35? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
With altcoins finding support levels to find the nearest footing as Bitcoin stabilizes at around $28K, TWT price retests the $1 mark. The ongoing retest and the lower side rejection increase the support to a bull run possibility in the Trust Wallet Token price. 
Escaping the long-term dynamic resistance of the 50-day EMA, the TWT price turns the tides in a bullish favor. With a jump from $0.71 to reclaim the $1 mark, the uptrend in Trust Wallet Token continues to form higher lows. 
With TWT buyers driving the market value higher by 46% within the last 40 days, the Trust Wallet Token might soon recover the 25% YTD drop. Following the 200-day EMA and $0.95 retest, the bullish jump reaches the $1.15 peak before retesting the psychological mark of $1. 
Taking a sharp reversal from the 200-day EMA, the retest of $1 seems successful and may soon charge the bull run. Moreover, the possibility of a morning star pattern arises at $1, teasing a stronger comeback for Trust Wallet Token.
The TWT price is currently trading at $1.049 with an intraday jump of 0.77%, sustaining the bullish spirit. Given the intraday growth and lower price rejection, the possibility of a post-test reversal from the $1 mark seems likely.
Technical indicators:
MACD indicator: The MACD and signal lines maintain a positive trend despite the shortfall in histograms. Thus maintaining a positive outlook on the TWT price trend. 
EMA: The increasing proximity of the 50-day and 200-day EMA signals a potential golden crossover.
With the market ready to continue the Uptober rally, the altcoins may soon find a bullish comeback. In the case of Trust Wallet Token, the long wick and the demand at $1 may soon propel the prices. Considering the post-retest jump exceeds the $1.15, the TWT price can reach the $1.35 mark, accounting for a 16% hike.
Conversely, an increase in selling speed due to profit booking can lead to a retest of $0.90.

Bitcoin On The Brink: 50% Drop Possible Ahead Of Halving, Analyst Warns;"Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasts and investors are keeping a watchful eye on the ever-volatile cryptocurrency market as the clock ticks closer to the highly anticipated halving event in April 2024. 
Benjamin Cowen, a well-known crypto analyst with a substantial following, has raised concerns about the potential for a significant price drop in Bitcoin before this upcoming halving.
In a recent interview with Scott Melker, Cowen delved into the historical patterns surrounding the alpha coin’s price movements in the lead-up to halving events. 
He highlighted that, while he didn’t explicitly predict a 50% drop, historical data suggests that such a decline is not out of the question. Looking at past cycles, Cowen revealed that BTC typically experiences a sharp decrease in value prior to a halving event. 
In his words, “What normally happens is Bitcoin halves [in price] before the halving, and then people are like, ‘Oh, well, that’s what the halving meant.'”
To illustrate his point, Cowen pointed to the previous market cycles, notably the drop that occurred ahead of the pandemic and the one prior to that. Each time, the king coin’s value plummeted by approximately 50% before embarking on its remarkable bull run. 
The commonality of these drops, especially the ones that initiated in the summer, led Cowen to ponder whether the current market might still be within the bounds of a 50% decline. If so, it could potentially fall to around $15,000.
Cowen’s concern about a looming BTC price drop isn’t unfounded. One of the key factors contributing to this apprehension is the dwindling liquidity within the cryptocurrency market and various risk asset markets. 
As liquidity decreases, assets like Bitcoin can become more susceptible to sharp declines. It’s a sign that has historically preceded significant market movements, and Cowen believes that this time could be no different.
On the other side of the Bitcoin spectrum, vocal crypto advocate Max Keiser shared his thoughts on the cryptocurrency’s future price trajectory. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts have been inquiring about when Bitcoin will reach the fabled $220,000 mark. 
However, Keiser cautions that these levels are typically achieved “AFTER social unrest and societal breakdown are irreversibly causing havoc.” 
People ask ‘When’ $220,000 for #Bitcoin ?
Keep in mind, #Bitcoin trades at these levels AFTER social unrest and societal breakdown are irreversibly causing havoc.
You have to prepare for higher prices AND economic collapse.
Good luck!
— Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) October 17, 2023

He pointed out that the world is currently witnessing widespread social unrest in many major cities, driven by geopolitical turmoil in several countries. Keiser’s warning rings clear: people, especially Bitcoin holders, should be prepared for the possibility of higher prices coinciding with economic collapse.

The crypto market is as unpredictable as ever, with Bitcoin currently trading at $28,582 via CoinGecko, showing a 1.8% gain over the past 24 hours and a 5.7% increase over the past week. 
As the community eagerly anticipates the 2024 halving event, analysts like Cowen and Bitcoin advocates like Keiser provide essential insights and warnings for both seasoned investors and newcomers alike, reinforcing the need for cautious optimism in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.

Uniswap V4 Expected To Be Huge, But Is This Requirement A Dealbreaker?;"Due to its innovation, Uniswap Labs plans to introduce Hooks in the upcoming Uniswap v4, putting the world’s leading decentralized exchange in the spotlight. According to a critic on social media platform X, the DEX is on the know-your-customer (KYC)-verification route once Hooks on Uniswap v4 are released.
Sharing screenshots, the user shared insights and said the exchange brings KYC verifications on the latest iteration. At the same time, the platform plans to use the “permission required” off-chain server on UniswapX for performance enhancements. 
UniswapX is an open-source solution allowing permissionless and open trading across Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and other liquidity sources. It is currently being tested on the Ethereum mainnet.
Though the community has embraced these developments, the critic said these requirements, especially the identity verification requirement on Hooks, will be available as an option before being gradually made mandatory down the line.
Uniswap v4 is being developed, and Hooks will be one of the key updates. Hooks are programmable extensions for customizing pool and trade behavior, tightly integrated with Uniswap’s core protocol. 
With Hooks, it becomes easier for developers to implement other features such as dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders, and overly improved customization. In this way, it will also be possible to integrate Uniswap v4 into other protocols.
The DEX has constantly evolved and released new features since the first version went live in late 2018. Uniswap v1 introduced AMM, opening up decentralized finance (DeFi). This allowed liquidity providers (LPs) to be crucial to market making. 
In Uniswap v3, the exchange released concentrated liquidity (CL). This feature allows LPs to specify a price range within which they are willing to provide liquidity. In Uniswap v2, LPs provided liquidity across the entire price range of the token pair. In v3, liquidity depth increases while traders get better pricing.
Despite the criticism, Hooks has been supported in some quarters. For instance, the user acknowledged that the feature would amplify the value proposition of some protocols, making them real “DeFi” platforms. At the same time, while responding to the critic, another commentator said the feature will do more than what anybody else has done for “real DeFi.”

Uniswap v4 is being developed, and Hooks will be one of the key updates. Hooks are programmable extensions for customizing pool and trade behavior, tightly integrated with Uniswap’s core protocol. 
With Hooks, it becomes easier for developers to implement other features such as dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders, and overly improved customization. In this way, it will also be possible to integrate Uniswap v4 into other protocols.
The DEX has constantly evolved and released new features since the first version went live in late 2018. Uniswap v1 introduced AMM, opening up decentralized finance (DeFi). This allowed liquidity providers (LPs) to be crucial to market making. 
In Uniswap v3, the exchange released concentrated liquidity (CL). This feature allows LPs to specify a price range within which they are willing to provide liquidity. In Uniswap v2, LPs provided liquidity across the entire price range of the token pair. In v3, liquidity depth increases while traders get better pricing.
Despite the criticism, Hooks has been supported in some quarters. For instance, the user acknowledged that the feature would amplify the value proposition of some protocols, making them real “DeFi” platforms. At the same time, while responding to the critic, another commentator said the feature will do more than what anybody else has done for “real DeFi.”

Crypto Winter Might Be Over, Says Morgan Stanley, All Eyes On April 2024;"According to a report by the global investment bank Morgan Stanley, signs indicate that the cyclical “crypto winter” bear market, which has plagued the cryptocurrency industry, may finally end. 
The report explores the historical pattern of Bitcoin’s (BTC) performance following halving events that occur approximately every four years. Furthermore, the report estimates that the next halving event could occur around April 2024.
Per the report, Bitcoin, the dominant cryptocurrency, is a barometer for the overall crypto market. One distinctive feature of Bitcoin is its halving process, which creates scarcity and helps maintain its value. 
Every four years, the number of BTC generated every 10 minutes is halved. This deliberate reduction in supply has historically affected Bitcoin’s price, often triggering a bullish market rally. 
Previous cycles have witnessed three notable bull runs that lasted 12 to 18 months after each halving event.
The four-year cryptocurrency cycle aligns with the seasons, providing a framework to understand market behavior:
According to Morgan Stanley, summer represents the phase immediately following a halving event, during which Bitcoin’s price gains are typically observed until it reaches a new peak.
Fall signifies when Bitcoin surpasses its previous high, attracting media attention, new investors, and businesses. This phase indicates that the bull market is nearing its end.
Winter characterizes the bear-market decline, initiated by profit-taking and selling pressure from investors, resulting in price drops. This phase persists until the next market trough, typically around 13 months.
Spring is the phase leading up to the next halving event, during which Bitcoin’s price generally recovers from the cycle’s low point. However, investor interest tends to remain relatively weak during this period.
Determining whether crypto spring has truly arrived requires considering several factors. These include the time elapsed since the last peak, the magnitude of Bitcoin’s drawdown from its high, miner capitulation, the Bitcoin price-to-thermocap multiple, exchange-related issues, and price action. 
These indicators can provide insights into whether the market has reached a trough or is still experiencing crypto winter.
While the report suggests that crypto winter may be in the past and crypto spring is on the horizon, it emphasizes the importance of learning more about the crypto market’s cyclical tendencies. 
BTC is trading at $28,500, showing a modest recovery in the past 24 hours after an unsuccessful attempt to stabilize above $30,000 on Monday, followed by a subsequent decline to the $28,000.
Notwithstanding this recent volatility, Bitcoin has maintained substantial gains across various time frames. It has experienced a notable surge of 7.4% over the past seven days, 4% over the past fourteen days, 5% over the past thirty days, and an impressive 49% surge over one year.

Matrixport Predicts Bitcoin Surge to $56,000 if SEC Greenlights Blackrock’s Bitcoin ETF;"The cryptocurrency financial services platform Matrixport predicts that bitcoin prices could surge to between $42,000 and $56,000 per unit if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves Blackrock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. 
In an investor note published on Thursday, the crypto firm Matrixport said the approval of Blackrock’s spot bitcoin ETF could potentially bring between $24 billion and $50 billion of inflows into bitcoin. This is based on the assumption that between 10% to 20% of investors in precious metals ETFs, which have about $120 billion in assets, may allocate 1% of their portfolios to a bitcoin ETF.
“If Tether’s market cap increases by $24 billion, acting as a proxy for potential ETF inflows, Bitcoin’s price would rise to $42,000, representing a conservative estimate,” Matrixport said. “With a larger influx of $50 billion (1% allocation from RIAs), Bitcoin could potentially rally to $56,000.”
The prediction comes after a recent fake rumor that the SEC had approved Blackrock’s spot bitcoin ETF application briefly sent prices up by $2,000, before falling back by $1,000 to $1,200 when it was revealed as false news. Matrixport believes macroeconomic conditions this year are more favorable for crypto, predicting in December “a substantial crypto rally” driven by lower U.S. inflation.
Matrixport’s investor note said Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust has already significantly outperformed bitcoin itself so far in 2023. “At the year’s outset, GBTC’s net-asset-value (NAV) discount was -45%, slightly narrowing to -43%,” Matrixport disclosed. “However, the game-changer came when Black Rock announced its ETF application on June 15, 2023.”
The crypto firm said there are around 15,000 registered investment advisors in the U.S. overseeing $5 trillion in assets that could potentially recommend slight bitcoin allocations. Even a 1% bitcoin allocation would bring $50 billion into the space.
“This group holds immense potential, and even a modest 1% allocation recommendation for Bitcoin would usher in around $50 billion in inflows,” Matrixport said. In July, the company also said that BTC prices could reach $125,000 per unit by the end of 2024.
“If history is any guide, then, there is now a 100% probability that by the end of 2024, Bitcoin will experience another massive bull market with a price target of $125,000,” the digital currency company stated at the time. Matrixport anticipates robust recoveries for both bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH), predicting that their volatility will significantly diminish. Blackrock amended its ETF filing on October 18, 2023, with the SEC.

Roblox Denies XRP Integration Amid False Claims;"Roblox, a widely popular user-generated gaming platform, has refuted assertions of its intention to accept XRP, the cryptocurrency affiliated with Ripple. Roblox' disclosure comes after several crypto news outlets reported yesterday that the platform has ""integrated"" with Ripple's XRP for payments through a partnership with BitPay.
The dispute arose following a tweet from BitPay, a payment processor, which suggested that XRP could be used for payments in Roblox and other supported games via Xsolla. However, BitPay later deleted the tweet, citing an error, despite saying that future announcements would be made regarding payment integrations for gaming platforms.
“There was an error in the tweet. We will have more tweets about merchants accepting crypto in the near future. Stay tuned,"" shares BitPay CMO Bill Zielke.
BitPay has not clarified or specified whether this does include Roblox.
On the contrary, Roblox's response was swift and categorical, dismissing any notion of supporting XRP payments. A Roblox spokesperson clarified that while Xsolla serves as one of the platform's payment providers, Roblox does not facilitate transactions involving cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or XRP. The removal of BitPay's tweet was attributed to its inaccurate content. The prospect here is invariably clear, though, given the rise of Web3 gaming and metaverse platforms in recent years, creating blockchain-powered digital environments for online interaction.
In practical terms, a simple examination of Robux purchases on Roblox's website shows that the platform exclusively accommodates traditional payment methods within the United States. These options encompass credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, PayPal, Venmo, Klarna, CVS Pharmacy payments, and Paysafecards.
Xsolla, the tech firm mentioned in the initial tweet, affirmed its provision of diverse payment solutions for developers to employ across different platforms, with BitPay being just one of these options. Notably, Xsolla explicitly stated that it had no involvement in BitPay's deleted post. The company has a track record of offering payment solutions to notable gaming industry players, including Valve, Twitch, Epic Games, and Krafton.

Chainalysis Says Crypto’s Role in Terrorism Financing is Exaggerated ;"Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis has debunked reports and analyses floating around in the media that inflate the role of cryptocurrencies in terrorism financing.
In a recent report geared toward correcting misconceptions regarding the use of crypto by terrorists to finance their operations, Chainalysis data revealed that digital assets play a minor role in the activity.
Chainalysis pointed out that while some terrorist organizations, including Hamas, Jihad, and Hezbollah, raise and transfer funds using crypto, these transactions make up a small fraction of the already limited volume of illicit crypto transactions.
“Terrorism financing is a very small portion of the already very small portion of cryptocurrency transaction volume that is illicit,” Chainalysis said.
The report noted that terrorist groups have historically used traditional fiat-based methods like financial institutions, hawala, and shell companies as their primary financing channels and will likely continue.
Chainalysis emphasized that the transparency of blockchain transactions makes it less suitable for terrorists, which is a major reason why Hamas stopped accepting Bitcoin donations. This transparency allows law enforcers to track the origin and destination of every transaction on the blockchain, a feat that is almost impossible to accomplish with cash transfers.
The report further addressed the flaws in analyzing crypto flows into terrorists’ accounts. Following the recent attack by Hamas on Israel, several reports on the estimated amount of crypto used to finance the group’s operations have surfaced.
However, Chainalysis stressed that estimates of crypto-related terrorism financing are often inflated when analysts include all transactions processed by intermediary service providers and not just those directly tied to terrorist groups.
The report warned that while large sums of crypto may appear linked to terrorists, a significant portion of these funds are unrelated. To improve anonymity, most service providers pool multiple transactions from different users. Thus, tracing such transactions can result in inaccurate estimates.
The report cited an example of a wallet linked to terror financing with about 20 suspected service providers as counterparties. On one of the counterparties, the firm discovered multiple transactions involving huge amounts of crypto, over $82 million.
Chainalysis pointed out that it would be wrong to conclude that all the funds were raised for terrorism financing. Upon further investigation, the analytics firm discovered that approximately $450,000 worth of crypto from the known terror-affiliated wallet was transferred through this counterparty.
The report also encouraged investigators to consider the role of service providers as they can facilitate the movement of terrorism-related funds, knowingly or unknowingly. Meanwhile, earlier this week, the Israeli government disabled over 100 Binance accounts potentially linked to Hamas.

Stablecoins now 16th largest holder of U.S. treasuries globally – report;"With the aggregate valuation of the top five stablecoins – USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI, and Tron – currently amounting to approximately $120 billion, stablecoins have become major holders of US Treasuries.
Following concerns over the “cash and cash equivalents” of stablecoin reserves earlier in the current Bitcoin cycle, stablecoin issuers like Tether began migrating to US Treasuries to reduce the risk exposure of reserves.
Tether (USDT) leads the pack with a circulating supply of $83.5 billion, accounting for about 70% of the stablecoin market. Interestingly, this dominance has been on an upward trajectory, while the influence of USDC witnessed a decline from 38% to 21% within 16 months.
This high valuation places stablecoins as the 16th largest sovereign holder of U.S. treasuries, according to Will Clemente’s analysis using The Block’s data. Clemente suggests that as demand for these digital currencies escalates, they could become even more significant.
This evolving trend aligns with CryptoSlate’s analysis conducted in July, which revealed that Japan and China, the two largest foreign holders of U.S. treasuries, have been reducing their holdings. Consequently, if stablecoin demand continues to surge, they could constitute a more critical segment of U.S. treasury holders, accentuating their influence in the global financial market.

Report: Namibian Police Arrest 20 Ringleaders of Local Pig Butchering Crypto Scam;"Police in Namibia recently arrested 20 individuals who are accused of running a so called “pig butchering” cryptocurrency scheme which targeted U.S. citizens. According to the police, the more than 80 young Namibians who worked for the scammers were promised a monthly salary of $160. 
The Namibian police are reported to have arrested and detained 20 individuals accused of operating a pig butchering cryptocurrency scheme. The accused, who include 11 Chinese nationals, face charges that range from human trafficking, fraud, money laundering and tax evasion.
According to a report in the Informante, individuals and corporations are among the more than 200 victims identified by police so far. Elias Mutota, the deputy inspector general of the Namibian police, said more than 80 young Namibians were recruited by the scammers. Mutota added that the young Namibians were promised a salary equivalent to $160 (N3,000 in local currency).

Explaining how the 20 operated the scam, the inspector general said:
“The suspected foreign nationals equally controlled the electronic wallet. They also provided the students with accommodation, paid them in cash, and transported them to and from the call centre, where they worked exclusively at night from 17:00 PM until the next morning at 6:00 AM. This night operation aimed to convince the USA clients that they were indeed in the USA, given the hours of transactions.”
As stated in the report, they would convince victims to invest a certain before abruptly ending communication. After that, the scammers would then withdraw the cryptocurrency at two Bitcoin Kiosks.
Following the arrests, the Namibian police reportedly recovered 163 computers, 350 mobile phones, six vehicles, 12 firearms, ammunition and cash equal to just under $19,500. With respect to the young Namibians who were used by the scammers, Mutota said they would either be charged or testify against the scammers.

Analyst Points Out Weird Bitcoin Activity On Bybit & Deribit Before Flash Surge;"An analyst has pointed out how some suspicious Bitcoin buying activity took place on Bybit and Deribit in the leadup to yesterday’s flash surge.
In a new post on X, Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, discussed how the BTC taker buy-sell ratio looked like for the different exchanges in the market leading up to the surprise rally yesterday.
The “taker buy sell ratio” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the taker buy and taker sell volumes for Bitcoin on any given exchange (or group of platforms).
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the taker buy volume is more than the sell volume currently. Such a trend suggests that the investors are willing to pay more to purchase the asset and thus, a bullish sentiment is shared by the majority.
On the other hand, a value under the threshold implies a bearish mentality is active on the exchange as the traders are willing to sell the asset at a lower price at the moment.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 24-day simple moving average (SMA) Bitcoin taker buy-sell ratio over the past few days for four exchanges: Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Deribit.

Yesterday, Bitcoin saw a very sharp sudden rally as false news broke out that the iShares BTC spot ETF had been approved by the US SEC. This surge, however, retraced in as spectacular a fashion as it had occurred as the market quickly realized that the rumor was without any substance.
From the chart, it’s visible that all four of these exchanges saw spikes in the taker buy-sell ratio in the hours leading up to this rally. The spikes on Binance and OKX, though, were of pretty normal levels, as spikes of similar scales had occurred in the preceding days as well.
In the case of Bybit and Deribit, however, the 24-day SMA of the ratio had hit peaks of 41 and 98, respectively, which are both extremely high levels. For comparison, the indicator only hit 1.8 on Binance and 6.3 on OKX.
This would suggest that some really high Bitcoin buying volume was observed on Bybit and Deribit, which was unlike what was seen on other exchanges in the sector.
It’s unclear what this pattern means, but it’s possible that some users on these platforms had already been tipped on the fake announcement in advance.
Regardless of the quick rally and crash, Bitcoin has enjoyed some upward momentum during the past couple of days as the cryptocurrency’s value has now climbed toward the $28,500 level.

Swiss Bank Offers Clients Crypto Lending Product;"Swiss online bank Dukascopy has introduced a new lending product that enables customers to borrow against their cryptocurrency. The solution allows users to receive 50% of the value of their digital assets in fiat currency while retaining their original crypto investments.
Geneva-headquartered Dukascopy Bank is now offering clients an option to borrow cash in U.S. dollars while keeping their investments in cryptocurrency. Under the bank’s new lending program, they can receive a loan for 50% of the value of their crypto assets in fiat equivalent.
To take advantage of the feature, customers need to open a multi-currency bank account (MCA) and transfer the crypto they want to use. Then they can find the digital assets in the “Investments” section and select the “Crypto lending/borrowing” option. The bank said in a press release:
In your MCA account, you will find 50% of your investment market value in fiat.
Upon signing a “Trading Agreement,” users will also receive login credentials for a trading sub-account, in which they’ll find another 50% of the investment market value of their crypto in fiat as collateral as well as their crypto investment as an open position.
This means that if you send 0.1 bitcoin (BTC) to your MCA account, you would receive $1,405 and change (at the time of writing) on your bank account and the same amount of fiat on your trading account, according to the online calculator on the bank’s website.
Dukascopy would also open a long margin position of 0.1 BTC/USD on the trading sub-account. All these operations are automated, the Swiss financial institution noted, adding that a commission of 1% applies to the incoming crypto transfer.
The new offering of Dukascopy Bank, which is regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, comes in challenging times for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole and the crypto lending sector in particular, with increased regulatory pressures and high-profile bankruptcies such as those of Celsius and Voyager.
Do you expect to see more crypto lending products offered by traditional banks in the future? Tell us in the comments section below.

Bitcoin SV Price Analysis: Why Is BSV Price Pumping? Is This The Right Time To Invest?;"The post Bitcoin SV Price Analysis: Why Is BSV Price Pumping? Is This The Right Time To Invest? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The crypto industry regained momentum as the market displayed a rise in its charts for the third consecutive day. Further, the Bitcoin price has managed to break out of its crucial resistance level of $28,000 for the first time after two weeks, indicating a possibility of a significant price movement in the coming days.
The Bitcoin SV price traded sideways briefly as the coin was trading in a consolidated range between $30.65 and $32.53 since the start of September.
Following the beginning of October, the coin gained significant traction as the price experienced massive price action. As the coin gained bullish momentum, it surged from $32 to $43.47 by breaking out of multiple resistance levels.
The price then got rejected and lost momentum, resulting in the price to plunge to a low of $32.53. BSV price traded in a consolidated range of $32.53 and $34.49 for about a week, indicating a disinterest among the investors in this crypto.
A piece of news then broke out stating that the iShares spot ETF application had been approved by the SEC, after which the Bitcoin SV coin price regained momentum and made a run to retest its upper resistance level. Still, the price was rejected at $41.52 as the news was confirmed fake.
The BSV price is presently testing its resistance level of $37.75, of which the outcome is uncertain.
The MACD had displayed constant flatlines for September. Since the start of October, significant fluctuations can be seen in the chart, indicating massive buying and selling pressure for this crypto. Further, the histogram displays a decline in the green histogram, suggesting a possibility of a price correction in the coming days.
If the bulls push the price above the resistance level of $37.75, the price will gain momentum enough to prepare itself to test the upper resistance of $39.52 soon.
If the market continues to gain momentum, the price will make a run to test its resistance zone at $41.50, and if it manages to break out of it, the price is bound to test the critical resistance level at $43.47 this month.
On the contrary, if the bears come into power and trend reversal occurs, the price will lose momentum, start trading under a bearish influence, and test its support level of $36.16.
Moreover, if the market experiences a short selling or a significant whale activity, the price will record a price plunge and may fall back to its lower support level of 30.65 in the coming days.

Millions of Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin (XRP) Liquidations on False BTC ETF Rumors: Bits Recap Oct 17;"TL;DR

The cryptocurrency community was infused with a dose of enthusiasm yesterday (October 16) when several reports indicated that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally approved BlackRock’s application to launch the first spot BTC ETF in the States.
The entire digital asset market reacted more than positively to the rumors, with Bitcoin (BTC) shooting to a two-month high of almost $30,000 (per CoinGecko’s data). Ripple’s native token – XRP – also headed north, spiking by around 5% to surpass the $0.50 mark. 
However, it turned out that the news was fake, and most of the gains were erased in a matter of minutes. XRP retraced to its previous level of $0.49, while BTC plunged to approximately $28,000.
You can also check our most recent video if you’re interested in finding out some of the more interesting projections for XRP’s price for the last quarter of 2023.

The popular memecoin was also in the spotlight by witnessing a few advancements and receiving support from another leading crypto exchange. Specifically, the Shiba Inu burn rate soared to 250% on October 16, outlining the project’s goal to make SHIB more scarce and potentially valuable in time. 
The team has so far destroyed over 41% of the maximum token supply (999,982,689,938,617 assets), with over 53 million SHIB sent to an address that nobody could access yesterday.
In addition, the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange – BitTrade – announced its intentions to allow deposits and withdrawals in Shiba Inu and Dogecoin from October 18. 
Mass adoption and the successful execution of the burning rate have been labeled as key factors that could boost SHIB’s valuation in the future. However, the memecoin’s price performance has been relatively poor in recent weeks. It is down 3.5% on a 14-day basis and almost 4% for the last month.

Grayscale GBTC discount falls to 16% as SEC misses ETF appeal window;"The evolving world of crypto is realizing new investment opportunities. Grayscale  Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is among the favored firms for traditional investors seeking to invest in digital assets. Recent events in the digital market have shown that GBTC’s discount to its net asset value (NAV) has reduced by close to 16%. 
The discount fall comes in as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) missed its ETF appeal window. The market is now in a buzz, anticipating the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (EFT). 
Moreover, this has also shocked the entire crypto community as GBTC is employed in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital world.  Moreover, Bitcoin Exchange -Traded Funds (ETFs) approach full approval in the US. 
Currently, the investment vehicle Grayscale Bitcoin  Trust (GBTC) is trading at its lowest discount in the last 2 years. According to the YChart data of 13th October GBTC against Bitcoin’s NAV was leveled at 15.87%. The percentage measures the sum of mutual funds (ETF) that is now trading lower than its net asset value (NAV). 
The primary role of this is to track the metrics of how far a security is trading from its value. The discount reduction was witnessed when financial institutions and BlackRock filed to onboard Bitcoin ETFs in mid-June 2023. 
The discount dropped by 17.3% from June 15 to July 5. This was a recorded drop from 44% to 26.7%. A similar drop was recorded in December 2021 when Bitcoin peaked at its all-time high of $69,000 on November 10. 
The current drop to 15% is a near 2-year low on Friday, and this is in the past 22 months. Additionally, the discount has been dropping, recording a nearly 50% reduction since the beginning of the bear market late last year, from December. 
The latest proceedings followed the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), missing its window to appeal against the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeal’s verdict in August. The verdict had overturned the SEC’s prior Bitcoin ETF proposal rejection. 
This was a huge win for Bitcoin ETF advocates. Moreover, it signaled a probable shift in the regulatory stance on ETF product investment. It challenged the SEC’s usual concerns on inverter protection as well as market manipulations
The verdict was to set aside the regulators’ decision to reject Grayscale’s ETF conversion attempts. The SEC had a chance to appeal the verdict until Friday midnight but never did. 
Grayscale reported a delivered statement on October 15 after noticing that the SEC failed to seek a rehearing, elapsing its 45-day grace period. As such, the court will issue its final mandate in the next 7 calendar days. 
As such, the SEC can now write up new reasons to decline the Grayscale bid to cover its  ETF. They could also file for an en banc appeal. Additionally, as the SEC engages with other spot-ETF applications, it’s discount diminished, but investors are onboarding Bitcoin ETF seeking their full approval. 
According to Noelle Acheson, the author of the Crypto Is Macro Now Newsletter, in the weekend edition, had some comments on the matter. The SEC’s failure to appeal means it has to consider its ruling, which could also be a denial of the GBTC ETF appeal. 
The president of the ETF store, Nate Geraci also commented on the field appeal by the SEC, stating that it could mean a potential spot for an ETF launch in early 2024. As such, this could mean good news for Grayscale as it grows its probability of taking the lead in the ETF market, dominating other issuers. This is fit, it manages to get its appeal to cover its trust into ETF approved.

Ripple Price Prediction: Here’s How High XRP Price Can Rally;"The post Ripple Price Prediction: Here’s How High XRP Price Can Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Bold predictions and market chatter buzz with anticipation as renowned cryptocurrency analyst Austin Hilton forecasts a surprising uptick for XRP. Not just any rise – but a leap to the $27 mark. With the current price hovering at a mere $0.49, such a prediction turns heads.
Unlike simple speculation, Hilton’s prediction isn’t plucked from thin air. He relies heavily on the Elliott Wave Theory, a popular technical analysis tool. This approach suggests XRP’s value could soar to $27 by 2026. With 2024 just around the corner, this trajectory hints at significant gains for investors in the coming years.
The market is currently sending favorable signals. While many cryptocurrencies demonstrate bullish trends, XRP has seen a nearly 3% uptick in the past seven days. This increase might appear small now, but for keen-eyed investors, it’s a sign of the potential upward journey ahead.
For those unfamiliar, the Elliott Wave Theory analyzes market cycles by observing extremes in investor psychology. This framework has a loyal following of market experts who swear by its accuracy. Hilton’s reliance on this theory only amplifies its credibility.
Crypto isn’t just about numbers. It’s about community, belief, and the drive to revolutionize traditional financial systems. Austin Hilton, an avowed member of the ‘XRP Army’ and a staunch supporter, underscores this. For him, even a rise to $3 or $4 is monumental, signaling a win for the community. With events like the Bitcoin ETF launch and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, the crypto world expects to see a surge, and XRP is poised to ride this wave.
While hitting the $27 mark by 2026 sounds promising, Hilton advocates a pragmatic approach. Even if XRP reaches values like $3, $4, or even $5, it’s a significant achievement for the cryptocurrency and its holders.

Bitcoin’s $15 Trillion Market Cap Within Reach: Scaramucci Says;"At the beginning of the year, Bitcoin [BTC] kicked off with positive momentum. Despite its present state of unpredictability and inactivity, there has been a continuous influx of optimistic speculations regarding the leading cryptocurrency. Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and managing partner at SkyBridge Capital, has now joined the ranks of those making bullish forecasts. He envisions a remarkable increase in Bitcoin’s value. He suggested it could surge by an impressive 2,662% from its current market capitalization of around $543 billion.
In a recent podcast, Scaramucci calculated that based on BTC’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization suggests a price of more than $700,000 per Bitcoin. This stands in contrast to the current price of the asset, which is $27,747.01. He added, 
“I think bitcoin could easily be a $15 trillion asset. Bitcoin in many ways is more valuable than gold. We own a lot of Bitcoin here.”
Although acknowledging the ascendancy of Bitcoin, he expressed his skepticism about it evolving into a universally accepted form of currency, as fervent Bitcoin proponents envision, at least within his lifetime. However, he did entertain the notion that unconventional scenarios might unfold. This could lead to situations where nations at odds with the United States could consider trading in Bitcoin. This is in addition to denominations linked to gold, thereby moving away from the U.S. dollar. This potential shift could be driven by concerns over how the U.S. has employed the dollar to assert its geopolitical influence over other countries, according to Scaramucci’s perspective.

In the BTC market, a notable development occurred last week when the average holding duration for transacted BTC reached a 4-month milestone. This indicates a notable increase in activity among BTC holders with a long-term outlook. The last time such an extended holding period was observed was back in January 2022, following the end of a bull market.

‘Yeah, it’s gonna get approved’: Mike Novogratz predicts 2023 approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs;"In an Oct 18. interview, Mike Novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy Digital, expressed confidence in the impending approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), saying, “Yeah, it’s gonna get approved.”
Speaking on SquawkBox, Novogratz emphasized the perceived shift in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance on such ETFs. According to the CEO, significant progress has been made in the dialogue with the SEC, pointing towards an approval soon, potentially in 2023.
Novogratz drew attention to the SEC’s recent decision not to appeal a decision in its legal battle with Grayscale, saying the decision could prove pivotal.
He said of the ruling:
“The judge said… you have a futures ETF, and you’re saying you can’t have a cash ETF. That makes, intellectually, zero sense. And I think that put the SEC on the back foot. And I think Gensler needs a win—there’s a tremendous amount of pressure to do something that is rational. The American public wants this. BlackRock, who’s the largest asset manager in the world, is out publicly saying we’re gonna get this done… it just feels like the dialogue with the SEC is all heading in the right direction.
The Galaxy Digital CEO suggested that the underlying shift in sentiment and the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a credible asset by institutional players like Blackrock contribute to this optimistic outlook.
Furthermore, Novogratz said that the public filings and comments regarding the Bitcoin ETF approval process have become more constructive, implying that the SEC’s approach to thinking about Bitcoin ETFs has fundamentally shifted.
Despite this, Novogratz’s predictions should be taken in context. Critics argue that his vested interest in Bitcoin and its broader acceptance might influence his views. Nevertheless, a perceived momentum is building around the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.
Novogratz further noted that the market would likely respond positively to any such approval, suggesting a potential surge in Bitcoin’s value. He emphasized that this potential surge is not merely speculation but is backed by the commitment of major players like BlackRock, Invesco, and Fidelity.

Polygon’s MATIC Flashes Bullish Signal As Netflow Becomes Negative: What’s Next For MATIC Price?;"The post Polygon’s MATIC Flashes Bullish Signal As Netflow Becomes Negative: What’s Next For MATIC Price? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The market is now calm after the big ups and downs from yesterday, caused by wrong information about the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Interestingly, many altcoins have bounced back from the uncertainty. Currently, MATIC’s price is showing some positive signs according to on-chain data. As more people are taking their MATIC out of exchanges, it seems like holders are getting ready for the price to possibly go up quickly in the next few hours. 
Amid mixed market reaction, MATIC flashed a bullish signal, a move that market analysts and investors did not see coming, as its netflow took an unexpected move into the negative. 
The concept of netflow in the market refers to the difference between the number of tokens moving into exchanges and those moving out. 
A negative netflow indicates that more MATIC is being withdrawn from exchanges than is being deposited. This is typically a bullish signal for the token, suggesting a decrease in selling pressure and a potential increase in holding among investors, who may be anticipating a positive price movement. The netflow is currently at -2.58 million MATIC. 
Yet, worries of a downward trend are growing because big investors made substantial moves recently. The volume of large transactions spiked, going from just $13.6 million to a whopping $43.7 million in just one day, highlighting how these “whale” investors can move MATIC’s value.
What’s more, the trend that usually indicates a positive outlook has slipped. Big investors are now moving more of their holdings into exchanges, with the relevant ratio shifting from -1.85 to 1.96. This change suggests they might be planning to sell off their stakes, which could challenge any buying interest over time. Essentially, if these whales start selling their holdings, it could push MATIC’s price down due to increased supply on the market.
MATIC has been experiencing a slump after failing to surge above $0.55. However, there’s hope, as the bears haven’t fully leveraged this downturn. This situation points to a potential absence of aggressive selling when prices are low.
Currently, the bulls are attempting to defend a decline below $0.5 as the bears aren’t backing down easily. If bulls lose confidence, it might bring a further plunge in the MATIC price below $0.49, potentially triggering a more substantial price drop. If this happens, the next safety nets are anticipated at $0.42 and subsequently at $0.31.
For the bulls to indicate a strong reversal from the current scenario, they need to send the price above the 200-day EMA and maintain it at that level. Should this occur, the MATIC price might initially target a recovery price of $0.6, followed by a further climb to $0.69.

If this happens, the next safety nets are anticipated at $0.42 and subsequently at $0.31.
For the bulls to indicate a strong reversal from the current scenario, they need to send the price above the 200-day EMA and maintain it at that level. Should this occur, the MATIC price might initially target a recovery price of $0.6, followed by a further climb to $0.69.

U.S. Government Among Top Bitcoin Hodlers With Stash Valued At A Staggering $5.3 Billion;"
From the heightened federal crackdown on the crypto industry, it might appear the U.S. government cannot stand crypto assets. Yet there is a love-hate relationship: the federal government holds more than 200,000 Bitcoin worth over $5 billion despite offloading a few thousand BTC worth millions earlier this year. This arguably makes the U.S. the largest holder of Bitcoin among countries.
The United States government is now one of the largest Bitcoin holders. Per a recent report from the Wall Street Journal, it is estimated that the U.S. government still holds 194,188 BTC, valued at $5.3 billion based on today’s market rates. 
The large cache of Bitcoins is a result of three high-profile crackdowns on cybercrime and darknet activities, including the Silk Road seizure of 69,369 BTC in November 2020, the January 2022 Bitfinex hack confiscation of 94,643 BTC, and the seizure of roughly 51,326 Bitcoins from James Zhong last March. A considerable amount of BTC was also seized from Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, contributing to the government’s increasing stockpile.
It’s worth mentioning that the U.S. government’s Bitcoin hoard is stored offline in hardware wallets managed by the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Unlike regular crypto traders who ride the market’s wild ups and downs, the U.S. government’s Bitcoin cache isn’t affected by price swings. It’s not an investment strategy, but just a result of lengthy legal procedures. According to senior IRS executive Jarod Koopman, the government’s actions are dependent on its timelines, not market trends.
Notably, seized crypto assets do not immediately belong to the federal government. The U.S. Marshals Service, the agency tasked with selling seized property, only gets possession of the confiscated BTC after a court issues a forfeiture decision.
That being said, the U.S. government’s seized 194,188 Bitcoins constitute a considerable stash compared to that of other large holders. Although smaller than Grayscale’s cache of 643,572 BTC, it exceeds Microstrategy’s stash of 158,245 BTC and Tesla’s 10,725 BTC.

Salvadoran Vice President Felix Ulloa: Bitcoin Adoption Fueled El Salvador’s ‘Rebirth’;"The Salvadoran vice president, Felix Ulloa, has given his opinion about the relationship between the “rebirth” of the country and the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in a recent interview. For Ulloa, bitcoin has been an important factor, alongside others, in this revamp of El Salvador, drawing crypto-related investments and tourists to the country.
The Salvadoran vice president Felix Ulloa linked the positive developments in the country’s economy and the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender back in 2021, under the guidance of Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele.
While some multilateral organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) questioned this, heavily criticizing Bukele’s actions and calling on the country to drop the plan, Ulloa stresses that this has had a positive effect on the country.
In a recent interview, Ulloa told Forbes:
The enthusiasm that started in the sphere of the digital economy, with bitcoiners, where El Salvador, having positioned itself as the first country to adopt a cryptocurrency as legal tender, was at the forefront and attracted many investors who are in fact installed in Salvador.
For Ulloa, another industry that has seen a sharp recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic has been tourism, with this increase being linked to the country’s new security policies and bitcoin.
Bitcoin as legal tender makes it easy for tourists who enter the country to pay for goods and services without worrying about currency exchanges, Ulloa stressed.
President Bukele had linked bitcoin and the recovery of the tourism industry before. In August 2022, Bukele stated:
Only a handful of countries have been able to recover its tourism to pre-pandemic levels. And that’s international tourism, so the reasons behind it are mostly bitcoin and surf.
However, Ulloa takes this link even further, explaining that these two (tourism and bitcoin) are part of the recovery that El Salvador experienced during Bukele’s administration. He detailed:
Without a doubt, tourism and the use of digital currencies go hand in hand and are a sign of that future and the rebirth of our country.
What do you think about Felix Ulloa’s thoughts on the influence that adopting bitcoin as legal tender has had on the economic recovery of El Salvador? Tell us in the comments section below.

Christine Lagarde Says New Digital Euro Will Meet ‘Highest Privacy Standards’ Project Moves Into Next Phase;"European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde says that the digital euro currently being worked on by the EU will adhere to strict privacy rules.
In an announcement from the ECB, the central bank says that it’s moving into the “preparation phase” of its digital euro project following a decision from its Governing Council.
The ECB says that the digital euro aims to be a form of cash that could be used for all digital payments in Europe, and would be free of charge both online and offline in a private manner.
“The Eurosystem envisions a digital euro that would be free for basic use for individuals. A compensation model between intermediaries and merchants would ensure that there are incentives for intermediaries to distribute digital euro, as is the case for other electronic payment instruments, and that there are adequate safeguards against excessive service charges for merchants. The Eurosystem would bear its own costs, including those related to scheme management and settlement processing…
It could be used from person to person, at the point of sale, in e-commerce and in government transactions. No digital payment instrument offers all these features. The digital euro would fill that gap.”
Lagarde says that the digital euro will have the “highest privacy standards” and will co-exist comfortably with physical cash.
“We need to prepare our currency for the future. We envisage a digital euro as a digital form of cash that can be used for all digital payments, free of charge, and that meets the highest privacy standards. It would coexist alongside physical cash, which will always be available, leaving no one behind.”

Grayscale Makes New Filing to Convert GBTC Into Bitcoin ETF with SEC!;"The post Grayscale Makes New Filing to Convert GBTC Into Bitcoin ETF with SEC! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Grayscale Investments has filed a new registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) after last week’s ruling by a Washington, D.C., court directing the regulator to re-review the firm’s application. The company has submitted the shortened Form S-3 filing to offer new shares and plans to list them on the NYSE Arca under the symbol GBTC after receiving approval of NYSE Arca’s application. While the SEC did not appeal the court’s ruling, a number of factors must happen before a spot bitcoin ETF becomes available.

Bitcoin on the Verge of Deep Corrective Move Following BTC Rally to $30,000, According to Top Trader;"A trader who nailed Bitcoin’s (BTC) 2018 bear market bottom believes that the crypto king may be setting up for a pullback of more than 20%.
Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 225,200 followers on the social media platform X that he’s staying on the sidelines for now after Bitcoin failed to crack its psychological resistance at $30,000.
According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s recent rally appears to be part of an ABC corrective move that could see BTC plunging all the way down to $22,376.
“Nice move up on BTC overnight, wicked straight into my target price. I haven’t had a trade go that smoothly in a long time in this choppy disgusting market but I’m now sidelined again. I’m not sure we just rocket to new highs from here, this is going to be quite a strong resistance, in my opinion.
I’m still acutely aware that this move up can be a B wave, not enough conviction to short but happy to be sidelined again for a little bit and see how this unfolds.” 
Bluntz utilizes the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, an approach that attempts to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset may witness an ABC corrective wave after a move up to consolidate its gains prior to the next leg up.
On Monday, Bitcoin surged briefly above $30,000 on erroneous reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has greenlighted BlackRock’s bid for a spot-based BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Bitcoin has retraced since and is trading at $28,478 at time of writing.

Edward Snowden’s Bitcoin ETF Warning – What You Need To Know;"Edward Snowden has cautioned the burgeoning crypto community against the potential pitfalls of a spot-based Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). 
His remarks, delivered during the recent Bitcoin Amsterdam 2023 event, illuminated a crucial debate within the realm of digital finance, emphasizing the delicate balance between mainstream adoption and the preservation of the alpha coin’s decentralized ethos.
Edward Snowden is a former American intelligence contractor who gained worldwide prominence in 2013 for leaking classified documents from the National Security Agency (NSA), revealing extensive global surveillance programs, such as PRISM, that raised significant concerns about government overreach and invasion of privacy.
His actions ignited a global debate on the balance between national security and individual privacy, and he sought asylum in Russia to avoid US prosecution. Snowden’s disclosures had a profound impact on the discourse surrounding government surveillance and the protection of civil liberties.
At the crux of his argument lies a fundamental concern that the advent of Bitcoin ETFs could progressively domesticate the very essence of the crypto, steering it away from its roots of decentralization. 
Central to the discourse is the pressing question of whether the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs represents a gradual erosion of the core principles underpinning the decentralized and permissionless financial system, or if it serves as a stepping stone toward the broader acceptance and integration of the crypto asset within the traditional financial framework. 
“We’re all part of a much bigger game and #Bitcoin is one of our strongest levers in that.” – Edward Snowden pic.twitter.com/UPtog9H4xl
— The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) October 17, 2023

Snowden’s emphasis on the significance of the systems currently under the influence of digital currencies resounded with the audience. “The systems that we are influencing, that we are exerting leverage on – payments and finance – will shape what the world of tomorrow looks like,” he emphasized, underlining the critical need for a thoughtful and comprehensive approach.
The escalating excitement within the community regarding the price surge and its correlation with the prospects of ETFs was a matter of concern for Snowden. Acknowledging the ongoing price volatility, he emphasized the undesirability of Bitcoin’s valuation being contingent on the development of ETFs. 
“We don’t really want that to be the thing that moves the price, even if the price is moving,” he stressed. According to Snowden, such dependence on ETFs would essentially signify a form of subordination, leading to a gradual process of taming, contrary to the very essence of the cryptocurrency’s liberating potential.
Apart from the apprehensions surrounding the integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial structures, Snowden also delved into the critical issue of anonymity in Bitcoin transactions. 
Reflecting on his own experiences from 2013, when he resorted to Bitcoin for funding classified document-hosting servers, Snowden voiced his reservations about the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin.

He pointed out the vulnerabilities that stem from its struggle to ensure genuine anonymity, which can potentially render it susceptible to the prying eyes of governments and surveillance agencies.
Amid Snowden’s cautionary remarks, the cryptocurrency market has witnessed a steady yet modest surge, with Bitcoin currently trading at approximately $28,582 according to CoinGecko. 
Over the last 24 hours, the digital asset has recorded a modest gain of 2%, while the seven-day rally has demonstrated a commendable increase of 5.7%, signaling the resilience of the cryptocurrency in the face of ongoing regulatory debates and market uncertainties.

Binance leads as Bitcoin exchange outflows surge;"Bitcoin market dynamics are showing a notable shift, as evidenced by the massive outflows from exchanges. According to recent data, in the span of two days, exchanges experienced a substantial outflow of Bitcoin, amounting to approximately $430 million.
On Oct. 16 alone, an estimated $250 million left exchanges, followed by a subsequent $200 million on Oct. 17. Interestingly, around half of these outflows originated from Binance, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges globally.
These outflows signal a decrease in Bitcoin on exchanges, which has led to a consequential rise in Bitcoin’s price, from roughly $26,500 to $28,500, a significant leap within a short timeframe.
Over four days, from Oct. 14 – Oct. 17, approximately 16,000 Bitcoin have been withdrawn from exchanges. Furthermore, the total number of Bitcoin held in exchange wallets is approaching a year-to-date low, with the count nearing the 2.3 million Bitcoin mark.

Bitcoin market dynamics are showing a notable shift, as evidenced by the massive outflows from exchanges. According to recent data, in the span of two days, exchanges experienced a substantial outflow of Bitcoin, amounting to approximately $430 million.
On Oct. 16 alone, an estimated $250 million left exchanges, followed by a subsequent $200 million on Oct. 17. Interestingly, around half of these outflows originated from Binance, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges globally.
These outflows signal a decrease in Bitcoin on exchanges, which has led to a consequential rise in Bitcoin’s price, from roughly $26,500 to $28,500, a significant leap within a short timeframe.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF Approval Rumors Debunked ;"Global investment management giant BlackRock has refuted recent claims suggesting that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved its proposed iShares Bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). 
NEW: Official statement to @FoxBusiness from @BlackRock: “The iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF is still under review by the SEC.”
The initial excitement sparked by fake reports of the alleged SEC approval was swiftly dampened as the firm clarified that the news was false. According to the firm’s statement, the SEC is still reviewing their application, dispelling the premature celebrations within the community. The decision is yet to be made with other pending ETF approval proposals.

NFTScan Announces Support for Scroll Network for Explorer and API Services Following Mainnet Launch;"Following two days of Scroll network’s mainnet launch, the world’s largest NFT data infrastructure, NFTScan, announced its support for the Scroll Network on its widely acclaimed Explorer and API services. Users now have the effortless capability to navigate and retrieve on-chain information for any NFT asset within the Scroll Mainnet through Scroll NFTScan. Additionally, developers working on Scroll can now harness the comprehensive NFT APIs offered by NFTScan, integrating advanced features into their projects seamlessly. 
In a significant stride towards enhancing the NFT landscape, NFTScan has rolled out Scroll NFTScan, a specialized platform engineered to streamline the search and query of NFT data for both developers and users within the Scroll ecosystem.
NFTScan, renowned as a premier multi-chain NFT data service provider, has extended its support to Scroll, marking it as the 19th blockchain network to integrate with its services. This integration aligns with previous collaborations with high-profile blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, BNBChain, and Solana.
As of October 19, 2023, Scroll’s burgeoning network has witnessed the issuance of a staggering 71,484 NFT assets, accompanied by the creation of 519 unique NFT collections. These developments have collectively driven 78,015 on-chain transactions, with 13,715 wallet addresses currently holding NFT assets.
The newly minted Scroll NFTScan Explorer is poised to revolutionize user interaction with NFTs. It offers a long list of features, including Trading, Minting, Gas Tracker, and Ranking sections. This platform empowers users to dive into on-chain data of NFT assets within the Scroll network, providing smooth access and clarity. Additionally, it facilitates precise queries on NFT asset data and transaction histories linked to individual wallet addresses. 
In addition to these user-centric services, the NFTScan Developer Platform has unveiled its NFT API data services specifically for the Scroll network. This launch introduces multiple API query interfaces designed to serve a diverse range of indexing requirements pertinent to Scroll NFT data. Developers active in the NFT and Web3 arenas are invited to utilize the zkSync NFT API data services. This resource is integral for those looking to construct DApps and protocols on the Scroll network.
Scroll, an emerging player in zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) technologies geared towards blockchain scalability, announced the release of its mainnet on 17 October. 
The Scroll team underscored the simplicity of this migration process, stating that “everything operates seamlessly without requiring any additional adjustments.” This implies that the move to Scroll’s mainnet offers a plug-and-play solution for those seeking enhanced blockchain scalability through zkEVM technology. 
Based on information from the block explorer, Scroll’s testnet has registered over 900,000 active wallet addresses and has recorded approximately seven million transactions since August. This mainnet launch follows a year of rigorous testing, during which the testnet accumulated an impressive tally of over 55 million transactions.
The Scroll team is currently in the research phase for its decentralized prover network and decentralized sequencer. This signifies that the protocol is paving the way for permissionless batch publication at the base layer, even in the event of a sequencer halt.
Peng, one of the team members, said, “In the medium term, our objective is to minimize the chances of a sequencer halt through decentralization.”
While Scroll presently allows upgrades via a multi-signature wallet under the control of its core team, there are forthcoming plans to introduce a Security Council and a delayed upgrade mechanism. This means that protocol upgrades will only be possible with approval from the Security Council, and the multi-signature team will exclusively possess the capacity to initiate these delayed upgrades, as explained by Peng.

Bitcoin Dominance Soars to Bear Market High of 51%;"TL;DR

Bitcoin leaped 2% early Monday, adding $30 billion to crypto market caps. But here’s another potentially bullish portent for BTC: according to data from TradingView, Bitcoin dominance just reached a 31-month high.
Dominance is crypto industry jargon for a coin’s percentage of market share as measured by total market capitalization. Think of it as the size of each coin’s piece of the market cap pie.
As TradingView explains:
” It’s a great way to see how big a coin is relative to the whole crypto market — the value of everything is in comparison. It’s calculated by dividing a coin market cap by the overall market cap of the top 125 coins and then multiplying it by 100.”
That’s positive news for Bitcoin price after several weeks spent in a slowly downward trending lull since June. Meanwhile, the Ethereum vs. Bitcoin “Flippening” Index recently arrived at a 15-month low of 35%.
On Monday, Bitcoin bulls took the old Satoshi chain’s coin on a brisk launch up the price charts:
After several days of underwhelming price performance, bitcoin finally initiated a notable leg-up that drove it north by over a grand… the altcoins have followed suit.”
But Bitcoin’s competitive market share has been steadily growing since October 2022, when Bitcoin dominance reached a chart bottom almost exactly a year ago after a long tumble from 71% in Nov 2020.
Bitcoin dominance hasn’t been this high since Mar 2021.
Crypto investors are coming back around again to Bitcoin’s fundamental underlying thesis.
The soundness of decentralized banking, with a well-designed peer-to-peer network of qualified nodes, finally makes sense again in the wake of the FTX trials highlighting CeFi’s failures.
This is likely an explanation because the rise in Bitcoin dominance has coincided perfectly with the months since the collapse of FTX, Luna-Terra, and several crypto banks and CeFi ventures.
Meanwhile, 50% of bitcoin hasn’t moved in a year.
According to Forbes Digital Assets:
Coupled with the institutional desire to see bitcoin products approved and start trading reinforces the fact that bitcoin is increasingly viewed as an asset class, and that bitcoin continues to separate itself from the slew of other tokens projects that have flooded the marketplace in the last several years reinforces this trend.
So, there’s less selling pressure for BTC on crypto exchanges, and holders have a strong conviction in it. That’s a strong contributor to Bitcoin’s dominance over competing cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin Signals Super Bullish Outlook As Sharks Holding 100-1000 BTC Sees Largest Jump;"
Bitcoin kicked off the week on a positive note, surging past $28,000 late on Monday. This upward momentum had a cascading effect on other cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and other altcoins also posting notable gains.
This rapid price movement caught short-sellers off guard, resulting in significant losses amounting to $26.1 million in the past 24 hours, per data from Liquidations data firm Coinglass.
Notably, Bitcoin’s surge coincided with positive news from the crypto analytics firm Santiment. In a tweet, the firm announced that on Sunday, 16 additional wallets joined the group of those holding 100-1,000 BTC, marking the largest single-day growth since February 28, 2022.
Furthermore, data from the firm shows that Bitcoin whales purchased approximately 117 BTC in the past 48 hours, reinforcing the belief in a bullish future for Bitcoin.
“As key stakeholders grow, the argument for a bullish future gets stronger,” the firm wrote.
In another tweet, Santiment attributed the surge to the movement of long-dormant coins, signalling potential price reversals.
“Bitcoin’s return to $27K was likely aided by large amounts of older, stagnant coins that were finally moved. The largest amount of dormant $BTC changing wallets since July, these spikes in our Age Consumed metric indicate price direction reversals.”
Elsewhere, in a lengthy tweet, renowned market analyst Scott Melker pointed out the significance of the increase in the number of large Bitcoin wallets. Notably, the number of large wallets has been steadily growing since February 2022, reaching a record high of 157,400 by September 26, 2023, surpassing the previous all-time high set in 2019.
In the crypto world, “sharks” typically hold between 100 and 1,000 Bitcoin, while “whales” have even larger holdings. The pundit noted that this accumulation of Bitcoin by these large holders signifies a growing bullish sentiment and solidifies Bitcoin’s position as a mature asset class, attracting various investors, including institutions and high-net-worth individuals.
Meanwhile, amid these developments, analysts have been looking for clues that could suggest Bitcoin is on the verge of a further price rally. 
Analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that the Bollinger Bands on the Bitcoin 4-hour chart are tightening, indicating an imminent spike in volatility. According to him, a close above $27,000 or below $26,690 in the 4-hour candlestick will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s future trend direction.
Crypto trader Nebraskangooner also echoed Ali’s sentiments, highlighting the importance of BTC breaching the $27,000 level. “Bitcoin interestingly enough reclaimed $27,000 resistance. Can consider looking for bullish scenarios above that level.” He tweeted Monday morning.
At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $28,469 after a 5.35% surge over the past 24 hours.

Crypto Tokens MOON and BRICK Plunge as Reddit Sunsets Community Points;"On Tuesday, the social news hub Reddit unveiled that it would be drawing the curtains on the Community Points project. This revelation promptly sent two cryptocurrency coins from r/cryptocurrency and r/fortnite spiraling downward, showcasing a notable dip in value following the news. This development also irked a multitude of Redditors, with conversations surrounding the plan to sunset the points spiraling into chaos.
While they might not ring a bell, two digital currencies, MOON and BRICK, have witnessed a significant plunge in value over the past 24 hours. This tumble springs from Reddit’s decision to back away from offering Community Points, setting the sun on the project come November 8, 2023. Although Reddit has expunged the Community Points FAQ page, it remains accessible through archived snapshots.
Initially brought to light by Techcrunch, the news garnered further clarity as Reddit’s Director of Consumer and Product Communications, Tim Rathschmidt, explained the rationale behind shelving the venture. “Though we saw some future opportunities for Community Points, the resourcing needed was unfortunately too high to justify,” Rathschmidt told Techcrunch contributor Morgan Sung. The Reddit executive also noted that the regulatory climate has played a part in the reasoning.
Following the dissemination of the news across the crypto community and Reddit, two Community Points tokens, MOON and BRICK, took a nosedive. The r/cryptocurrency coin MOON tumbled 84% while the r/fortnite token shrunk nearly 40% in value. On Reddit, particularly within the subreddit r/cryptocurrency, a plethora of individuals voiced their dissatisfaction with the unfolding events. A moderator remarked:
We are very disappointed in Reddit’s decision today, and want to clarify that we were not made aware of this decision until 1 hour ago.
“Terrible move that will make Reddit very untrustworthy going on, you just ruined a lot of dreams [and] cost people an insane amount of time and money that they invested just so you could say that your trial was cool [and] you got some info from it all?” another person wrote. Within the same thread, a maximalist from r/bitcoin chimed in to offer their perspective.
“MOONS was an ill-fated project based on pump and dump dynamics designed to enrich a few mods of this subreddit,” opined the Redditor Fiach_Dubh. “It is not a decentralized network like Bitcoin. Reddit would do well to adopt Bitcoin as a form of community points via Bitcoin’s second layer, the Lightning Network.” This sentiment, however, didn’t sit well with several individuals.
“I love Bitcoin, but what kind of cynical maxi bullshit is this? F*** off,” one person replied. “[Lightning Network] is its own kind of dogsh**,” another remarked.
Since their inception in 2021, Reddit’s blockchain-fueled Community Points tokens had woven a fabric of expectation among Redditors, many of whom envisioned the project sailing smoothly for several more years. A handful of Redditors have articulated their resolve to uphold these projects independently, without Reddit’s patronage. As of now, the MOON tokens ecosystem has a total of 126,013,438 tokens shared among 211,104 unique holders.
The lion’s share, or 66.72% of the supply, is nestled in the vaults of the top 100 MOON holders. On the flip side, the BRICK tokens realm is populated with approximately 115,217,218 BRICK units, across 156,945 unique addresses. A similar trend of accumulation is evident here too, with the cream of the crop, the top 100 holders, possessing a hefty 70.14% of the BRICK tokens in circulation.

BlackRock Chief Says The Spot ETF Rumor-Induced Bitcoin Pump Signifies ‘Pent-Up Interest In Crypto’;"
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink shared his thoughts on the controversy that happened on Monday, which began with cryptocurrency media outlet Cointelegraph publishing the purported news of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of the asset manager’s much-awaited spot Bitcoin ETF.
According to Fink, the crypto rally that ensued represents a “flight to quality” driven by real economic factors, not false speculation.
The Monday false rumors that the SEC had approved BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF sparked a frenzy of excitement on the X platform that sent the flagship crypto’s price skyrocketing to $30,000.
A spot market Bitcoin ETF is somewhat of a holy grail for the cryptoverse, despite the fact that these products already trade in Canada and Europe. The reason has to do with the SEC blocking the dozens of requests it has seen so far, putting it out of reach for U.S. investors seeking Bitcoin exposure without the hassle of holding the crypto directly.
“It’s just an example of the pent-up interest in crypto,” BlackRock’s Fink posited during an interview with Fox Business. “This rally is way beyond rumor. I think the rally today is about a flight to quality.”
Looking to the future, he expects crypto to evolve into an important asset for investors, specifically as a safe haven during harsh economic times.
The CEO’s view is a particularly upbeat spin on the controversial event, which contributed to roughly $136 million worth of liquidations in the span of 24 hours. As ZyCrypto covered earlier, Cointelegraph retracted its post and BlackRock eventually debunked the rumor — causing BTC to fall from $30,000 to $28,000 levels.
The SEC also issued a statement saying: “Careful what you read on the internet. The best source of information about the SEC is the SEC.” 
Bitcoin is currently changing hands at $28,475 as of publication time, a 2.4% gain over the last 24 hours.
While Larry Fink stressed that Monday’s incident only affirmed the global demand and enthusiasm for a Bitcoin spot ETF amid ongoing international unrest, others in the crypto community did not see the situation as optimistically.
Observers like Bitfinexed have pointed out that the event could be used by SEC chairman Gary Gensler to show the high volatility of the Bitcoin market and how easy it is to be manipulated. 
Well, now the SEC knows there was a fake Bitcoin Spot approval market manipulation pump that they can cite in the next spot Bitcoin ETF denial.Which helps them deny the applications again because they can show manipulation of the underlying market.Great job guys. https://t.co/1HtZPExJmc
Despite BlackRock’s impeccable 99.8% ETF approval record, it’s still unclear how the SEC will decide on this, given that it hasn’t approved any previous BTC ETFs and is resolutely targeting leading crypto exchanges.
Furthermore, Bitcoin supporters fear the Monday pump-and-dump event likely dashed any hopes of a Bitcoin spot ETF being greenlighted for trading in the US in the near future.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink shared his thoughts on the controversy that happened on Monday, which began with cryptocurrency media outlet Cointelegraph publishing the purported news of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of the asset manager’s much-awaited spot Bitcoin ETF.
According to Fink, the crypto rally that ensued represents a “flight to quality” driven by real economic factors, not false speculation.
The Monday false rumors that the SEC had approved BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF sparked a frenzy of excitement on the X platform that sent the flagship crypto’s price skyrocketing to $30,000.
A spot market Bitcoin ETF is somewhat of a holy grail for the cryptoverse, despite the fact that these products already trade in Canada and Europe. The reason has to do with the SEC blocking the dozens of requests it has seen so far, putting it out of reach for U.S. investors seeking Bitcoin exposure without the hassle of holding the crypto directly.
“It’s just an example of the pent-up interest in crypto,” BlackRock’s Fink posited during an interview with Fox Business. “This rally is way beyond rumor. I think the rally today is about a flight to quality.”
Looking to the future, he expects crypto to evolve into an important asset for investors, specifically as a safe haven during harsh economic times.

SEC Holds Back from Appealing Court Decision on Grayscale Bitcoin ETF: Report;"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has exceeded its mid-October deadline to refute Grayscale’s court win for the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).
The financial agency will not appeal in court regarding the decision, Reuters reported on October 13th, citing a source familiar with the matter.
The legal tussle between the American regulator and the asset management firm dates back to last year. Grayscale applied with the SEC, requesting the conversion of its flagship product, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), into a spot Bitcoin ETF. The conversion intention is part of the investment company’s plan to convert its major Trust products into ETFs.
Receiving a green light on the application would allow Grayscale to offer a Bitcoin-backed asset that tracks Bitcoin’s price more efficiently than GBTC. Shortly after the agency dismissed Grayscale’s request last year, the investment company filed a lawsuit against the SEC.
After a year-long legal battle, Grayscale secured a groundbreaking court win from a federal court presided over by three judges in August. The judges directed the SEC to consider approving Grayscale’s request for a spot Bitcoin ETF, terming its continued delay as “capricious.”
Following the August 29th court decision supporting Grayscale, the financial regulator had a 45-day window to file for an en banc court hearing, a kind of hearing where all the court judges come together to decide a matter instead of having a single judge or a small panel of judges presiding over the case.
Admittedly, the SEC’s decision to hold back from challenging the August court ruling involving Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF allows the financial watchdog to review the company’s application.
However, it does not directly imply that the long-awaited spot Bitcoin ETF will be endorsed within the country. Jennifer Schulp, the director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, reiterated this when she said:
“It doesn’t mean that that approval is coming quickly and it’s still not a certainty given that the SEC could re-review and deny on different grounds and basically start this legal fight all over again.”

Expert Trader Identifies 6 High-Potential Altcoins To Watch;"In its latest update on October 18, renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital has highlighted six altcoins that have caught his attention, showing potential for the remainder of 2023, Ocean Protocol (OCEAN), Dogecoin (DOGE), Woo Network (WOO), Verasity (VRA), Stellar (XLM), and Injective (INJ).
Rekt Capital’s analysis suggests a crucial moment for the Ocean Protocol. Whether the current price deviation will result in a downside wick below the red channel placed at $0.2763 or if the price will close below it weekly. 
While a downside wick followed by a recovery could lead to a move toward the Channel Top at $0.3247, a weekly close below the Channel Bottom would necessitate keen observation for price rejection as new resistance.
On the other hand, Rekt Capital notes that Dogecoin has been meandering at the bottom of its channel at $0.058890.
However, recent price developments indicate that the potential bullish divergence in its 1-week chart is likely no longer valid. 
The lower low has shifted from support to resistance, confirmed by price action and a breakdown in the RSI’s trendline. Although a scenario of DOGE reclaiming its lower low remains possible, Rekt believes that a more definitive reaction is needed to confirm a potential fake breakdown.
Woo Network has experienced a relatively subdued quarter compared to the first half of 2023. Despite the uncertain macro outlook, WOO Network remains confident in its vision and mission. 
Notably, the network successfully negotiated the repurchase of shares and tokens from the estate of Three Arrows Capital, alleviating uncertainty for WOO Network’s community and investors.
Verasity is a protocol and product layer platform for esports, video entertainment, and digital content management. Rekt Capital acknowledges the breakout from the mid-term downtrend structure in Verasity’s native token. 
The token has been establishing higher lows after reaching a low point on October 4, indicating a potential shift in momentum.
Stellar is a blockchain-based payments network that facilitates global, efficient digital asset issuance and exchange. XLM has recently displayed sideways price action, trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Nonetheless, Rekt Capital includes Stellar in their altcoin watchlist, suggesting it is one to watch.
Injective is an open and interoperable blockchain optimized for DeFi applications, utilizing the Tendermint PoS consensus mechanism. Rekt Capital highlights the significant uptrend in INJ’s native token in the past 24 hours and over the past year, with a remarkable surge of 290%.
As Rekt Capital’s analysis indicates, these six altcoins – OCEAN, DOGE, WOO, Verasity VRA, XLM, and INJ – have caught the attention of the crypto analyst. 
While each cryptocurrency presents its unique opportunities and challenges, investors and enthusiasts can look forward to monitoring their performances and assessing their potential for the remainder of 2023.

Taproot Assets launches on Bitcoin, introducing tokenized asset capabilities to the network;"Lighting Labs has announced the mainnet alpha of the Taproot Assets daemon, providing the network with the capacity to hold tokenized assets.
This release offers a comprehensive developer experience for issuing, managing, and exploring stablecoins and other assets on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain, according to a post by the director of business development at Lightning Labs, Ryan Gentry.
The launch of Taproot Assets on the Bitcoin mainnet is expected to facilitate the issuance of a wide range of global currencies as Taproot Assets. These transactions will be settled instantly over the Lightning Network, routing Taproot Assets transactions through the existing Bitcoin liquidity.
The protocol’s design enables routing nodes to forward transactions without recognizing them as Taproot Assets, thereby extending Bitcoin’s global network effects while strengthening the blockchain’s robust security foundation. Developers are exploring placing other potential real-world assets on-chain, like gold, US Treasuries, and corporate bonds.
The v0.3 protocol of the Taproot Assets presents a complete set of tools for developers who are keen to start issuing, managing, and exploring mainnet assets on-chain. It introduces several new functionalities and improvements in scalability, security, and developer experience.
The stated goal of Taproot Assets is to transform the Lightning Network into a multi-asset platform. Critical steps towards this goal have already been completed, including running unannounced Taproot channels in production with lnd v0.17 and the publication of the draft specification for Taproot Asset Protocol channels as a Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposal (bLIP).
Lightning Labs teased Taproot Assets in May of 2023, calling it “a new Taproot-powered protocol for issuing assets on the bitcoin blockchain that can be transferred over the Lightning Network for instant, high volume, low fee transactions.”
The protocol’s promise to enable users to send and receive their chosen currency over the Lightning Network, using Bitcoin liquidity as a global routing currency and Medium of Exchange, has the potential to redefine—or at least significantly disrupt—the process of global monetary transactions.

SOL Price Prediction: Why Solana Could Surge 25% Above This Key Hurdle;"Solana is correcting gains from the $25 resistance against the US Dollar. SOL price remains supported and might aim for a fresh rally toward $30.
After a steady increase, Solana struggled to clear the $25 resistance zone. SOL formed a high at $24.82 and recently started a downside correction, like Bitcoin.
There was a move below the $24.20 and $22.00 levels. The bears pushed the price below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $20.94 swing low to the $24.82 high. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $23.90 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair.
SOL is now trading above $23.00 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It is now showing positive signs and remains supported above the $22.00 pivot level.

Source: SOLUSD on TradingView.com
On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $24.00 level and the triangle region. The first major resistance is near the $24.00 level. The main resistance is still near the $25.00 zone. A successful close above the $25.00 resistance could set the pace for a larger increase. The next key resistance is near $28.50. Any more gains might send the price toward the $30.00 level.
If SOL fails to recover above the $24.00 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $22.85 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $20.94 swing low to the $24.82 high.
The first major support is near the $22.40 level. If there is a close below the $22.40 support, the price could decline toward the $21.80 support. In the stated case, there is a risk of more downsides toward the $20.50 support in the near term.
Technical Indicators
4-Hours MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone.
4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $22.85, and $22.40.
Major Resistance Levels – $23.90, $24.00, and $25.00.

Prosperity in Web 3.0 – The Prospect of Collaboration Among Web 3.0’s Power Players;"Everyone knows the sales pitch by now – Web 3.0 is a revolutionary paradigm shift from the centralized, outdated and exploitative models active in legacy finance and Web 2.0.
Yet, despite the principles and common ground shared by Web 3.0’s leading blockchain ecosystems, the nascent industry has become a battleground of sorts where projects operate from independent silos, competing fiercely for market share.
In the Web 3.0 space as it stands today, tribal communities and infighting have dimmed a once-powerful flame – one that was kept ablaze in its prime by collaboration and symbiosis.
In order for Web 3.0 to turn the corner and emerge from a suffocating multi-year bear market, the space’s power players must unite in returning to cooperative efforts, win-win relationships, open doors and integrated approaches to driving adoption and the proliferation of Web 3.0 technologies.
Web 3.0 – a shared vision, a shared mission
Web 3.0’s inception was underpinned by a shared mission – to disrupt legacy finance and Web 2.0 platforms.
Rather impressively, there have been many success stories that have birthed a user-centric digital world where governance and profits are distributed among network participants – not monopolized by central entities.
In 2023, there exists a breadth of equitable, transparent and efficient ecosystems that align the interests of all contributing stakeholders.
It’s a beautiful sight to behold, especially considering where Web 3.0 started barely a decade ago.
Nonetheless, Web 3.0’s leading projects and platforms now make up a complex maze of isolated ecosystems.
While each brings unique advantages to the table in the form of scalability strategies, smart contract functionality and governance tools, individual ecosystems largely remain self-serving and focused on incubating internal growth.
The resulting incompatibility has created as many challenges for users as it has financial inefficiencies and security risks for the space as whole.
Liquidity fragmentation – the first cracks in the ice
One of the most tangible, measurable challenges to emerge from Web 3.0’s division has been liquidity fragmentation. Liquidity is the lifeblood that fuels on-chain transactions.
More broadly, liquidity is what keeps Web 3.0 users happy because it allows them to hold onto more of their capital through low fee structures, near-zero slippage and support for large-volume transaction.
While leading Web 3.0 ecosystems have focused exclusively on building up their own DeFi landscapes in isolation, significant chunks of liquidity have become locked up in siloed environments, leading to inefficient markets, poor price points and profit-diminishing slippage – all of which spell limited trading opportunities for users.
To overcome interoperability challenges, bridges have been introduced as patchwork solutions.
To make matters worse, more often than not, it’s third parties doing the development work rather than the disparate chains involved.
While bridges have served many users as practical – albeit inefficient – tools to transfer assets between their favorite ecosystems, by and large bridges have proven to be a double-edged sword.
Rather tragically, bridges have become a prime attack vector for hackers, who have identified bridges as Web 3.0’s weakest security link.
Numerous bridge exploits have led to hundred-million dollar losses, doing immense harm to ecosystems, platforms and users.
Apart from security vulnerabilities, bridges also carry inherent risks and limitations.
By requiring users to relinquish control of their assets to intermediaries, bridges often contradict the very essence of decentralization.
The path forward – replacing competition with collaboration
Before jumping to any conclusions, it’s important to recognize inadequate bridges, shallow liquidity and security exploits for what they are – symptoms of a deeper problem.
The problem is a lack of congruency, a lack of communication and a lack of cooperation among Web 3.0’s leading blockchain ecosystems who see one another as competitors and rivals.
The current state of Web 3.0 underscores the urgency for a shift in mindset – from competition to collaboration. It’s not just about DeFi platforms and wallet providers either.
The powerhouse blockchain ecosystems that are headlining the Web 3.0 space need to begin to see one another as allies reinventing a global financial network and even the internet itself.
Such an immense undertaking simply does not allow space for rivalries or insular approaches to growth and development to take form.
In the grand scheme of the plight of Web 3.0, the whole is indeed greater than the sum of its parts.
By fostering collaboration and interoperability, we can create a unified, robust and vibrant Web 3.0 ecosystem that truly fulfills its original mandate.
It’s time for Web 3.0’s leading blockchain ecosystems to embrace the power of synergy – the future of Web 3.0 depends on it.

The post Prosperity in Web 3.0 – The Prospect of Collaboration Among Web 3.0’s Power Players appeared first on The Daily Hodl.
Everyone knows the sales pitch by now – Web 3.0 is a revolutionary paradigm shift from the centralized, outdated and exploitative models active in legacy finance and Web 2.0.
Yet, despite the principles and common ground shared by Web 3.0’s leading blockchain ecosystems, the nascent industry has become a battleground of sorts where projects operate from independent silos, competing fiercely for market share.
In the Web 3.0 space as it stands today, tribal communities and infighting have dimmed a once-powerful flame – one that was kept ablaze in its prime by collaboration and symbiosis.
In order for Web 3.0 to turn the corner and emerge from a suffocating multi-year bear market, the space’s power players must unite in returning to cooperative efforts, win-win relationships, open doors and integrated approaches to driving adoption and the proliferation of Web 3.0 technologies.
Web 3.0 – a shared vision, a shared mission
Web 3.0’s inception was underpinned by a shared mission – to disrupt legacy finance and Web 2.0 platforms.
Rather impressively, there have been many success stories that have birthed a user-centric digital world where governance and profits are distributed among network participants – not monopolized by central entities.
In 2023, there exists a breadth of equitable, transparent and efficient ecosystems that align the interests of all contributing stakeholders.
It’s a beautiful sight to behold, especially considering where Web 3.0 started barely a decade ago.
Nonetheless, Web 3.0’s leading projects and platforms now make up a complex maze of isolated ecosystems.
While each brings unique advantages to the table in the form of scalability strategies, smart contract functionality and governance tools, individual ecosystems largely remain self-serving and focused on incubating internal growth.
The resulting incompatibility has created as many challenges for users as it has financial inefficiencies and security risks for the space as whole.
Liquidity fragmentation – the first cracks in the ice
One of the most tangible, measurable challenges to emerge from Web 3.0’s division has been liquidity fragmentation. Liquidity is the lifeblood that fuels on-chain transactions.
More broadly, liquidity is what keeps Web 3.0 users happy because it allows them to hold onto more of their capital through low fee structures, near-zero slippage and support for large-volume transaction.
While leading Web 3.0 ecosystems have focused exclusively on building up their own DeFi landscapes in isolation, significant chunks of liquidity have become locked up in siloed environments, leading to inefficient markets, poor price points and profit-diminishing slippage – all of which spell limited trading opportunities for users.
To overcome interoperability challenges, bridges have been introduced as patchwork solutions.
To make matters worse, more often than not, it’s third parties doing the development work rather than the disparate chains involved.
While bridges have served many users as practical – albeit inefficient – tools to transfer assets between their favorite ecosystems, by and large bridges have proven to be a double-edged sword.
Rather tragically, bridges have become a prime attack vector for hackers, who have identified bridges as Web 3.0’s weakest security link.

From Wall Street to crypto: The lure of spot Bitcoin ETFs;"Ever get the feeling that Wall Street’s venerable giants are lured, just like the rest of us, to the siren call of cryptocurrencies? Not so long ago, traditional finance wouldn’t touch Bitcoin with a ten-foot pole. Now, they’re clamoring to jump on the Bitcoin ETF bandwagon. Why? Let’s dive into the muck and dissect what’s happening. 
Here’s the gist: Bitcoin ETFs have become the latest toy Wall Street wants to play with. If you’re wondering, “ETF what now?”, don’t fret. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent a monstrous $7 trillion industry. 
To put it simply, they’re like mutual funds that trade on stock exchanges. There’s been an incessant push, by both crypto startups and big-time Wall Street moguls, to birth an ETF that directly holds Bitcoin. 
Why is this a big deal? Because until now, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been the parent saying, “No, you can’t have that toy!” 
Not to the futures-backed Bitcoin ETFs – those got the green light in 2021 – but to the spot Bitcoin ETFs. The argument from these determined mavericks? Make these ETFs accessible, and watch as participation in the crypto arena skyrockets.
But here’s the crux. If you’re unsure about the difference between Bitcoin futures and spot Bitcoin, don’t get all twisted. Bitcoin futures are contracts determining the buy/sell price for a later date. 
Spot Bitcoin? That’s the real deal. You’re buying or selling the actual digital coin on exchanges. So, while futures give you a slice of the pie, with spot Bitcoin, you’re getting the whole dessert.
The past is filled with pioneers and their noteworthy moments. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF took the crown for being the first Bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. back in October 2021. 
Its northern neighbor, Canada, wasn’t far behind, with the Purpose Bitcoin ETF making waves in Toronto. But there’s been a whirlwind of activity. 
Investment trusts, despite their similarities to ETFs, came with handcuffs – restrictions, that is. Remember Grayscale and its feisty battle against the SEC for its attempt to transform its trust into an ETF? Spoiler: Grayscale won.
BlackRock, the world’s most colossal asset manager, stepped into the arena and tossed its hat into the ring. The consequence? The crypto market felt a jolt of excitement, and a cascade of applications flowed in from big players like Fidelity and WisdomTree. 
It seems Grayscale’s dream is to unlock a pot of gold (or should I say Bitcoin?) for its investors. The SEC, for all its bureaucracy, isn’t putting up more barricades. There’s some clarity, albeit muddied, on how this saga might evolve.
Now, if you’re asking why the SEC has been a stubborn mule about this, I’ve got three words for you: volatility, value, and verification. Regulators have had sleepless nights over Bitcoin’s erratic behavior. 
I mean, a 305% gain in 2020, a 60% rise in 2021, and a shocking 64% plummet in 2022? Talk about a wild ride! Add to that the SEC’s skepticism about accurately valuing tokens like Bitcoin and the complexity of determining their rightful owners. Throw in potential fraud and manipulation, and you’ve got yourself quite the cocktail.
However, not all is bleak. Some wise heads like BlackRock are proposing surveillance-sharing agreements to pacify the SEC’s anxieties. Coinbase has popped up as the go-to partner for this, making them the preferred hall monitor for these ETF issuers.
In the end, while some market oracles predict an approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF by year-end, I’d suggest not holding your breath. After all, many have tried before and returned from the battlefield defeated. 
But with regulators and asset managers potentially sitting down for some tea and conversation, who knows? The future might just surprise us. But let’s be clear: don’t expect Wall Street to do anyone any favors. The allure of Bitcoin ETFs? It’s all about the money, honey.

BREAKING: BlackRock Confirms, Bitcoin ETF Approval Fake News;"A post from crypto news outlet Cointelegraph spread rumors about approving a spot Bitcoin ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) in the US. Several top asset managers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but the regulator was yet to decide.
As seen in the image below, the crypto news outlet posted about the alleged approval of the iShares Bitcoin ETF filed by asset manager BlackRock. The post had half a million views as of this writing and triggered a spike in volatility in the crypto market a few moments after it went live.
As Cointelegraph posted about the BTC ETF, the cryptocurrency’s price touched $30,000 for the first time in months. However, the experts from Bloomberg Intelligence, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, stated that the news lacked legitimacy.
The experts debunked the report via their official X accounts, going as far as to call it “fake news.” Minutes after the news went live, Seyffart stated:
I believe this to be fake news. While this would be positive for the things we’ve been saying. I can’t find anything that would confirm this at the moment.
Fox News reporter Eleanor Terret confirmed with BlackRock that the report was fake, and their application continues to be reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
On the other hand, Balchunas expects the coming months to see more “fake reports” around the spot Bitcoin ETF approval:
While I expect to wake up one day in next couple months to a headline just like this, this seems a bit ahead of schedule. Trying to confirm source now. Stay tuned.. On one hand the crypto trades have solid rep of breaking big news, on the other they also have rep of taking words and re-ordering them in a more exciting but not accurate way
Despite Balchunas and Seyffart, Cointelegraph has yet to delete the post or issue a clarification. As of this writing, the post has over 2 million views and sparked a crypto community debate.
A popular crypto user asked for “jail” for the team behind the account, while others questioned the crypto news outlet for trying to break the news without a clear source.

Summer.fi Review: A Beacon of DeFi Innovation on Layer 2;"In the fast-evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi), Summer.fi has emerged as a shining star, offering a fresh perspective on DeFi services. Formerly known as Oasis, Summer.fi’s journey began back in 2016, even before the inception of the Maker Protocol and the Single Collateral Dai. In June 2023, Oasis rebranded itself as Summer.fi, a name that encapsulates simplicity, vitality, and a friendly atmosphere.
Summer.fi‘s approach to DeFi services is underpinned by blockchain technology, offering users unparalleled transparency and decentralization. With a suite of products, including Borrow, Multiply, and Earn, Summer.fi brings a host of benefits over traditional financial systems. In this comprehensive Summer.fi review, we will delve into the fundamental aspects of Summer.fi’s DeFi services on Layer 2 and explore its innovative features.
Summer.fi Borrow is the gateway to creating and interacting with Vaults, which are instrumental in unlocking liquidity from your crypto assets. Allowing users to finance large purchases, participate in other DeFi protocols and construct their own strategies.
One standout feature of Summer.fi Borrow is its support for over 20 cryptocurrencies as collateral, including ETH and WBTC. Additionally, Summer.fi has a generalized UX that gives users the opportunity to seamlessly select from a range of protocols to utilize for borrowing including Maker, AAVE, and Spark with many more in development.
Summer.fi’s Multiply feature powers up the process of borrowing funds. With a single transaction, users can adjust their collateral by depositing a supported cryptocurrency, borrowing a stablecoin, and then using it to acquire additional collateral. This streamlined approach eliminates the need for multiple transactions, reducing fees and saving time.
From July 2023, Summer.fi embraced Layer 2 scalability by launching on the Optimism and Arbitrum Layer 2 solutions for Ethereum. This move dramatically improved trading functionality, reduced transaction costs by up to 42 times, and enhanced scalability. Layer 2 solutions ensure seamless trading experiences even during peak periods, offering leverage-like trading with significantly lower fees.
Summer.fi’s Earn products are curated DeFi options designed to help users maximize their yields. Users maintain full custody of their assets while enjoying the benefits of DeFi yield farming. By working with Aave and Maker protocols, Summer.fi provides secure and controlled yield opportunities for users.
One noteworthy strategy within the Summer.fi ecosystem is the StETH Earn strategy, which allows users to increase yields by borrowing ETH and staking it as StETH. This innovative approach leverages the power of DeFi to optimize returns on crypto assets.
Additionally, Summer.fi offers a passive income opportunity through the Dai Savings Rate (DSR), allowing DAI holders to share in the revenue generated by MakerDAO. There are no lock-ups or fees for using the Dai Savings Rate, providing users with a hassle-free way to earn.

Summer.fi’s Multiply feature powers up the process of borrowing funds. With a single transaction, users can adjust their collateral by depositing a supported cryptocurrency, borrowing a stablecoin, and then using it to acquire additional collateral. This streamlined approach eliminates the need for multiple transactions, reducing fees and saving time.
From July 2023, Summer.fi embraced Layer 2 scalability by launching on the Optimism and Arbitrum Layer 2 solutions for Ethereum.

What is USDT? All About Tether Stablecoin Cryptocurrency;"USDT, also known as Tether, has become an integral part of cryptocurrency markets since its launch in 2014. Pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, it is the most widely used stablecoin with a market capitalization of over $83 billion as of October 2023. But it is also controversial, with opaque reserves and questions around its long-term viability.
Here is an in-depth look at how USDT works, its importance in crypto, and the risks it presents.
At its core, Tether functions as a stablecoin, meaning each token is backed by an equivalent amount of traditional fiat currency.
This peg to the dollar aims to minimize volatility compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. USDT operates on different blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron and others, allowing it to be transferred seamlessly between different networks.
Crypto traders rely on USDT as a stable store of value when trading between different digital assets. It is also widely used on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms for lending, borrowing, and making payments.
USDT price: $1
USDT Market Cap: ~$83 billion (as of October 2023)

The key features that define Tether include:
According to Tether Limited, the company behind USDT, every token in circulation is backed 1:1 by their reserves, which include both traditional currency and cash equivalents. When buyers purchase USDT by depositing $1 per token, new tokens are issued while the dollars are held in reserves.
This mechanism theoretically allows users to redeem each USDT to USD. By allowing two-way convertibility between USDT and dollars, the supply can adjust to maintain the 1:1 parity.
However, Tether’s reserves have been shrouded in secrecy over the years, leading to allegations that the company does not hold sufficient dollar reserves to back all USDT in circulation. Tether settled a case with the New York Attorney General in 2021, agreeing to release periodic reports on its reserves.
So far, the redemptions have generally maintained the dollar peg. But questions linger over the breakdown of reserves and their adequacy as USDT supply has ballooned.

USDT Price Chart from CoinMarketCap
Despite the opacity, USDT continues to play a hugely important role in cryptocurrency markets. It is one of the most widely traded crypto assets, with daily trading volumes in the billions of dollars against assets like Bitcoin.
Exchanges rely on stablecoin trading pairs like BTC/USDT to enable traders to hedge risk during times of high volatility.
USDT is also widely integrated into DeFi protocols like lending and borrowing platforms, decentralized exchanges, yield farms, and more. It provides stability in an otherwise volatile environment for decentralized finance.
The demand for USDT trading, transactions, and parking value in a stable asset continues to drive increasing adoption.
Going forward, the biggest threat to USDT is the risk of losing its 1:1 dollar peg and collapsing in value if its reserves are inadequate. Tether also faces potential regulatory crackdowns from authorities who may threaten its viability. Competing stablecoins like USDC and BUSD are more transparent about reserves and could gain share.
However, USDT retains first-mover advantage and the network effects of wider integration in crypto infrastructure. It continues to maintain peg stability through redemptions so far. If Tether can provide greater transparency and embrace compliance, USDT may retain its dominant position for some time. But traders should exercise caution and understand the risks of relying too much on USDT long-term.
Despite controversies around reserves and regulation, Tether remains an integral cog in the crypto economy machine. But as the market matures, stablecoins built on greater transparency and compliance are likely to emerge as leaders.

There are a few key mechanisms that enable USDT to function as a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar:
Tether mints new USDT when buyers deposit $1 per token with the company. The dollars are added to reserves, while an equivalent amount of USDT is issued on the blockchain ledger. This USDT enters circulation when transferred to the buyer’s wallet address. The minting helps adjust supply to match demand.
Once issued, USDT can be transacted between addresses on its supported blockchains like any other cryptocurrency. Senders can broadcast transactions and pay small network fees to send USDT to recipients’ wallet addresses. These peer-to-peer transactions are recorded transparently on public blockchain explorers.
USDT is listed as a trading pair on most major centralized crypto exchanges as well as decentralized exchanges. Traders can use USDT to buy and sell other cryptos like Bitcoin in a stable manner when volatility is high. In decentralized finance, USDT also serves as a stable currency for lending, borrowing, liquidity provision, and more.
In theory, USDT holders can redeem each token for exactly 1 US dollar from Tether Limited. This is made possible by the underlying reserves that back each token. Redemptions help maintain the 1:1 peg when USDT falls below $1 on exchanges. However, Tether reserves the right to delay or deny redemptions in some circumstances.
USDT provides stability amid crypto volatility but also carries risks:
Tether pioneered stablecoins in crypto but transparent alternatives like USDC are emerging. Regulatory direction will play a key role in determining whether USDT maintains dominance long-term.
In conclusion, USDT remains indispensable for crypto trading and finance today. But prudent users should assess risks of relying extensively on USDT if its opaque operations and reserves raise too many questions about its sustainability. As the sector develops, the stability and transparency offered by its competitors could make them a safer bet over the coming years

USDT TRC20 is the version of Tether stablecoin issued on the Tron blockchain as a TRC20 token. It allows faster transactions and lower fees compared to USDT on Ethereum. USDT ERC20 is available only on Ethereum.
USDT stands for United States Dollar Tether. It is a cryptocurrency issued by Tether that is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Each USDT token is backed by $1 in reserves according to Tether Limited.
USDC is issued by Circle while USDT is issued by Tether. USDC has greater transparency on reserves and audits compared to the more opaque USDT. However, USDT currently has wider adoption in crypto trading and DeFi applications.
Tether USDT is a stablecoin cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the US dollar on a 1:1 basis. It allows crypto traders and users to avoid volatility by storing value in USDT tokens backed by equivalent USD reserves.
USDT stands for United States Dollar Tether. It is the ticker symbol used to designate the Tether stablecoin whose value is pegged to the US dollar.
Yes, USDT is a cryptocurrency token issued on various blockchains. However, unlike volatile cryptos, USDT is a stablecoin designed to have a stable value through US dollar reserves.
The USDT token address allows users to verify USDT transactions on block explorers. For example, the USDT Ethereum contract address is 0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7.
The price of USDT is pegged to $1.00 USD. It aims to maintain parity with the dollar through Tether Limited’s dollar reserves that back each USDT token 1:1.
USDT provides stability versus volatile crypto assets. It is used for trading, payments, earning yield, loans, and other financial activities where dollar-pegged stability is preferred.
USDT can be purchased on most major crypto exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, KuCoin etc. You can trade dollars or cryptos like BTC for USDT tokens on these centralized platforms.
USDT does carry risks related to transparency and reserves that should be considered. Stablecoins like USDC with more transparency could potentially be safer long-term investments.

Ripple Lawsuit: XRP ‘Blow Up’ Nears As SEC Clears Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen of All Charges;"
In a surprising move, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced the dismissal of its case against Ripple Labs’ CEO Brad Garlinghouse and founder Chris Larsen, marking a significant turning point in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs Inc.
“Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) respectfully notifies the Court of the stipulated dismissal of the SEC’s pending claims against Defendants Christian Larsen and Bradley Garlinghouse (“Individual Defendants”).” A letter addressed to Judge Torres by the SEC read.
In a statement, Ripple Labs clarified that the dismissal was made without prejudice, indicating that the allegations have been dropped without any bearing on potential future legal actions.
This surprising development represents a significant triumph for Ripple Labs, building on the firm’s previous success in July when Judge Analisa Torres determined that the sale of XRP on secondary markets did not meet the criteria for an investment contract.
Notably, the SEC’s case against Ripple Labs was complex, involving allegations that the company’s leadership orchestrated the sale of XRP, classifying it as an investment contract.
That said, following the announcement, Brad Garlinghouse couldn’t resist a touch of humor, tweeting, “Today was an even better day. Ripple: 3, SEC: 0.” He went on to highlight the SEC’s questionable actions during the case, suggesting that they had wasted millions of taxpayer dollars.
Chris Larsen, Executive Chairman of Ripple Labs, also expressed his thoughts on the matter, saying, “Today, we are legally vindicated and personally redeemed in our battle against a troubling attempt to abuse the rules to advance a political agenda aimed at suffocating crypto in America. It is a travesty that we were forced to defend ourselves from an ill-advised attack that was flawed from the day it was filed.”
On the other hand, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, shared his perspective, calling the SEC’s actions a “surrender” rather than a settlement, adding that they had made a serious mistake by targeting Garlinghouse and Larsen personally.
That said, this latest success could further reinforce the precedent set by the XRP case for other cryptocurrencies, including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC), which are also under SEC scrutiny. Additionally, the unchallenged ruling favouring Grayscale has bolstered hopes for the eventual approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF.
Meanwhile, the news sent XRP’s value soaring, with the cryptocurrency surging by nearly 10% in minutes to reach $0.51. This impressive gain came after a period of low volatility in the crypto markets for the better part of Thursday.
The crypto community was also quick to react to the news, with the hashtag “#firegarygensler” dominating social media discussions, particularly on platforms like X (formerly Twitter).

ESMA warns no retail crypto protection in EU until 2024 at the earliest – report;"The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the bloc’s securities watchdog, warned that investors will not be protected under the European Union’s crypto asset market rules until the end of 2024 at the earliest.
According to a statement issued by the ESMA on Tuesday, as reported by Reuters, investors were advised to brace themselves for the possibility of incurring total losses.
The EU emerged as the first global jurisdiction to endorse a comprehensive set of rules designed to regulate markets for crypto assets such as Bitcoin, with the legislation coming into force in June. However, fully implementing these rules, known as the Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA), is not expected until Dec. 2024.
Reuters stated that the need for stringent crypto regulation has been underscored by recent events, including the collapse of FTX and drastic volatility in Bitcoin prices. However, it is worth noting that Bitcoin has retained one of the tightest ranges on record throughout 2023.
Currently, crypto assets remain unregulated under EU securities rules, and until the MiCA rules are fully implemented, investors will not benefit from any EU-level regulatory oversight or recourse mechanisms.
The ESMA’s statement cautioned that even with the enforcement of MiCA, no crypto asset would be considered entirely ‘safe’ for retail investors, Reuters reported. Crypto assets, the ESMA stressed, are susceptible to novel operational and security risks, asking investors if they can bear the brunt of losing all the money they intend to invest.
It was also clarified that full protections may remain elusive in EU states offering an 18-month transitional period allowing crypto firms to operate without an EU license. Consequently, customers may remain uncovered until at least July 2026. ESMA noted that a significant proportion of crypto enterprises are likely to continue operating under the transitional terms until mid-2026.
Crypto firms outside the EU will be permitted to offer services to customers within the bloc. Still, only in specific cases where the services have been specifically requested, and even then, the provision will be on a “strictly limited” basis. This exemption, the ESMA warned, should not be exploited to bypass the MiCA regulations.
The watchdog plans to collaborate with national regulators to expedite the application of MiCA rules, emphasizing that the EU should not be seen as a haven for “forum-shopping or illicit practices.”
Earlier this month, ESMA initiated another step towards enforcing MiCA by launching its second consultation package. As per the ESMA announcement on Oct. 5, the regulator is seeking feedback from stakeholders on five key areas: sustainability indicators for distributed ledgers, insider information disclosures, white paper technical requirements, trade transparency measures, and record keeping and business continuity requirements for crypto-asset service providers.
Stakeholders have been encouraged to provide feedback by Dec. 14. With plans to submit the draft technical standards to the European Commission by June 30, 2024, ESMA is proactively working towards fully implementing MiCA. More details about the transitional period and the timeline for MiCA measures are expected in the third consultation package, slated for release in the first quarter of 2024.

Solana Critical Path: Why The Next Solana Moves Demand Attention;"Solana (SOL) has been navigating a challenging correction phase for approximately two months, during which its fortunes have ebbed and flowed. The most recent dip, occurring on Aug. 15, was a direct response to a sudden decline in the price of Bitcoin, sending shockwaves throughout the crypto market. However, a closer examination of Solana’s price chart reveals an emerging inverse head and shoulders pattern.
For those unfamiliar with the inverse head and shoulders pattern, it is a technical chart formation that signals a potential trend reversal. It consists of three key components: a lower low (the head) with two higher lows on either side (the shoulders), forming an inverted “T” shape. This pattern typically signifies a shift from a bearish trend to a bullish one, making it an enticing prospect for investors.
Solana appears to be sketching out this intriguing configuration, hinting at the possibility of a significant upswing in its price. However, the realization of this bullish scenario hinges significantly on SOL’s ability to breach a crucial resistance point known as the neckline.
As of the latest data available on CoinGecko, Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $23.79. Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency experienced a slight dip of 0.6%, while it boasted a seven-day rally of 9.9%. These fluctuations reflect the ongoing battle between buyers and sellers, each vying for control of SOL’s price trajectory.

Solana has come a long way from its support level at $22.38, offering sellers an opportunity to exert pressure on the cryptocurrency. If the selling pressure persists, price predictions indicate that SOL could drop another 12%, potentially reaching a price of $18.8. The market’s vulnerability underscores the need for a cautious approach, both for existing investors and potential buyers.
A closer examination of the daily timeframe chart reveals a distinct downward trend characterizing the ongoing correction phase of the cryptocurrency. Sellers are likely to continue exploiting any resistance points during bullish bounces, making it essential for investors to exercise caution.

As the market continues on its downward trajectory, potential buyers are advised to exercise patience. The best strategy might be to wait until the neckline resistance is breached, signaling a change in trend. Timing remains paramount, and investors should be prepared to act when the conditions are right.
Solana’s journey through the correction phase has been a rollercoaster ride for investors. In the midst of ongoing market fluctuations, staying informed and cautious is essential for both existing and potential investors in SOL.

Mash And TFTC Partner Launch New Publisher Monetization Products Powered By Bitcoin & Lightning;"Today, Mash and TFTC announced they have joined forces to shake up online media monetization and user engagement, introducing a suite of tools powered by Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. This partnership also marks the relaunch of the TFTC publishing platform, now featuring curated content from authors like Parker Lewis, Jordan Schachtel, and Whitney Webb.
Historically, online media monetization has relied on advertising and subscriptions, with the only form of multi-user engagement being traditional comment sections. However, these legacy methods have proven unsustainable, inflexible, and less valuable to users and businesses. Mash and TFTC's new solutions aims to shift the way online content platforms operate.
At the forefront of this is Mash's ""Reactions"" product. It allows users to interact with content by adding their sentiments and opinions directly to the page, using imagery and animations. These reactions can be both free and paid-for with micro-payments, made possible by the Lightning Network. The goal of Reactions is to increase user engagement, time-on-site, and introduce a new revenue source to support high-quality content.
“Publishers and creator experiences have been trapped in single-player mode, causing the community to bifurcate elsewhere, including sites like Reddit,” said Mash CEO Jared Nusinoff. “Our new Reactions product is the first step to bring the entire user experience and multiplayer mode back to the site, where all stakeholders including the creators benefit and earn for the value they provide.”
In addition to Reactions, Mash has introduced a new on-page engagement hub for users to engage with content through voting, monetary contributions, and donations. They are also preparing to launch a transparent revenue-sharing model that distributes funds to all stakeholders, including the site owner, creators, contributors, and other staff.
TFTC has undergone a full redesign and expansion to offer more topics beyond Bitcoin, welcoming prolific authors like Robert Bryce, Parker Lewis, Jordan Schachtel, and Whitney Webb. This partnership with Mash allows them to provide curated, high-quality content on various topics while ensuring fair and efficient monetization.
“Our audience has been craving curated, quality content beyond bitcoin,” said Marty Bent, CEO of TFTC. ”The partnership with Mash allows us to be able to provide these experiences because of the new ways you can monetize and share revenue with contributors fairly and easily. We’re ecstatic to partner with Mash and showcase a new approach to make content broadly available and properly monetized”
The limited beta for these publisher monetization products is now live with select publishing partners and platforms, and interested parties can join the waitlist to be part of this transformative journey.

Bitcoin Bloodbath: Fake Spot ETF Approval Sparks BTC Surge, Obliterates $78M Shorts At $30,000;"In a flurry of market activity, false news surrounding the approval of a Bitcoin (BTC) Spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community. 
Initially reported by Cointelegraph, the news claimed that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Spot ETF had received regulatory approval. 
However, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart promptly cast doubt on the report’s authenticity, stating that he could not find any confirmation of the news at the time. Seyffart stated: 
I believe this to be fake news. While this would be positive for the things we’ve been saying. I can’t find anything that would confirm this at the moment. 
Subsequently, BlackRock confirmed to FOX reporter Eleanor Terret that the application was still under review, rendering the initial report false.
The repercussions of this misinformation were immediately evident in the market. BTC experienced a brief surge from $27,800 to $30,000 within minutes as traders reacted to the purported ETF approval news. However, as the truth emerged, the market corrected itself, causing a wave of liquidations.
According to data from Glassnode, the aftermath of the surge saw a significant increase in liquidations. Within four hours, $113.75 million in long positions and $78.87 million in short positions were liquidated, reflecting the volatility and sudden reversal prompted by the false news.
The incident also prompted Cointelegraph to apologize for a post that had disseminated inaccurate information regarding the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. 
The media outlet announced that an internal investigation is underway to determine the source of the misinformation. Cointelegraph stated:
We apologize for a tweet that led to the dissemination of inaccurate information regarding the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF. An internal investigation is currently underway. We are committed to transparency and will share the findings of the investigation with the public once it is concluded within 3 hours.
Despite the false breakout above $30,000, Bitcoin has retained significant profits within 24 hours. Currently trading at $28,100, it remains $1,000 higher than the initial price before disseminating the fake news across all platforms. This marks a 5.1% profit during this period.
Consequently, this positive turn of events has caused Bitcoin to shift from negative to positive figures across various time frames. In the past 7 days, Bitcoin has recorded a 2.6% profit, while over 30 days, it has seen a 6.4% increase. Only in the 14 days was a slight decrease of 0.4%.
Furthermore, a closer examination of BTC’s 1-day chart reveals its ability to surpass significant resistance levels. Notably, Bitcoin successfully overcame two critical moving averages: the 50-day MA at $27,150 and the 200-day MA at $27,030. 
These moving averages posed major obstacles for Bitcoin’s price after initially dropping below this threshold.
In addition, Bitcoin managed to break through the $28,000 resistance level, which had previously acted as a significant barrier following the false breakout above this mark.
Moving forward, the sustainability of Bitcoin’s current price level and bullish momentum remains to be seen amidst the circulating rumors surrounding the long-awaited ETF decision by the applicants and the US SEC.

Silk Road Hacker Accidentally Showed Feds $70,000,000 Worth of Bitcoin on His Laptop Before Being Arrested: Report;"Police body cam footage shows the Silk Road hacker opening up a laptop with thousands of Bitcoin (BTC) on it in front of federal investigators, not realizing he was incriminating himself.
James Zhong was charged by the US government last year for stealing more than 50,000 BTC from the illicit online marketplace Silk Road in 2012.
In 2019, After his house was broken into, Zhong called the police to inform them, despite having mountains of incriminating evidence lying around in his home. Zhong revealed over the phone that he was an investor in Bitcoin, putting himself on the radar of investigators.
At the same time, the IRS Criminal Investigation unit was painstakingly trying to solve the Silk Road hack of 2013, analyzing details of its on-chain paper trail.
Ultimately, an investigator from the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, who was hired by the government, noticed that an address associated with the Silk Road hacker accidentally performed a KYC (know-your-customer) routine with a crypto exchange, revealing Zhong’s name and home address months after his 911 call.
With help from Shaun MaGruder, CEO of a cyber intelligence company BlockTrace, the IRS created a plan to enter Zhong’s home and talk to him under the auspices of investigating the break-and-enter that he had reported earlier.
Once inside, Zhong made the grave mistake of telling investigators he was a “Bitcoin OG” and that he had 1,500 BTC sitting on one laptop alone, which he then proceeded to show investigators on camera.
Says MaGruder of BlockTrace,
“Lo and behold, he had $60 or $70 million worth of Bitcoins right there next to us…”
It was also revealed that Zhong was one of the earliest contributors to the development of Bitcoin, and routinely posted advice and suggestions on online forums for how to improve the Bitcoin protocol.
Investigators returned the following day, still under the pretext that they were helping him, but instead executed a search warrant.
Using a dog trained to find computer hardware, the agents found the wallets with the addresses to the 50,000 BTC, once worth over $3 billion, sitting in a safe buried in concrete underneath Zhong’s basement floor.
Zhong was sentenced to one year and one day in prison for his role in the Silk Road hacking incident.

Amount of Bitcoin held for a decade or longer nears unprecedented milestone of 3 million coins;"The Bitcoin landscape is witnessing an unprecedented event, as the number of Bitcoins that haven’t been moved for over a decade is nearing the 3 million mark. This represents approximately 15% of the current circulating supply of about 19.5 million Bitcoin.
The trajectory of these unmoved coins has seen steady growth, hitting its first million milestone in November 2019, followed by the second in March 2021. Projections suggest we may see the 3 million mark being surpassed by the close of Q4 2023 or the onset of Q1 2024.
This remarkable trend underscores an interesting contrast when compared to the amount of Bitcoin present on exchanges, currently numbering around 2,294,000. This quantity is outstripped by the growing supply last active over a decade ago, highlighting a significant shift.
This crossover initially occurred in November 2022, and the divergence has only been widening at an increasing rate since then.

Unraveling the Online Legacy of Satoshi Nakamoto: Bitcoin’s Mysterious Creator;"The mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto appeared online nearly 600 times through emails and forum posts. Records of Nakamoto’s writings indicate he was most active in July and August. While Nakamoto covered many topics, Bitcoin’s inventor was notably visible when sharing new release candidates, discussing the addition of password protection to Bitcoin’s JSON-RPC interface, and addressing the “overflow bug” from August 2010. 
In 2008, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin as a purely peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Nakamoto first mentioned the technology online on October 31, 2008, at 2:10 p.m. EDT. That year, Nakamoto sent a total of 16 emails, most of which introduced the technology created. While the inventor sent private emails to Wei Dai, Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, Laszlo Hanec, Jon Matonis, Hal Finney, and Dustin Trammel, Nakamoto sent 34 public emails to the Cryptography Mailing List and P2P Research.
Nakamoto posted 534 times on bitcointalk.org and the P2P Foundation forums combined. Based on the emails and forum posts, Bitcoin’s creator was most active online between noon and 2 p.m. Eastern Time. About 39 emails or forum posts were published in 2009, with the following year seeing the most online activity from Nakamoto. Bitcoin’s pseudonymous developer was most active in July, August, and February 2010. Nakamoto published about 146 posts in July and 129 in August.
The third most active month for Nakamoto in 2010 was February, with 48 posts. Eight months that year had fewer than 50 correspondences per month from Nakamoto. January 2011 saw the fewest, with just 11 posts. Most forum posts focused on the release of a new Bitcoin client. However, the other two main subjects were “Re: JSON-RPC password” and “Re: overflow bug SERIOUS.” The first topic had 13 interactions from Nakamoto as the developer introduced password protection to Bitcoin’s JSON-RPC interface.
This enhancement was crucial for safeguarding user funds, preserving privacy and ensuring the stable operation of the Bitcoin node. The second major topic was the widely discussed overflow bug, which led to the creation of 184.467 billion BTC for two distinct bitcoin addresses. This transaction surpassed Bitcoin’s maximum supply of 21 million, posing a significant concern. Nakamoto addressed the community with 15 posts that day and resolved the issue within five hours.
Nakamoto penned and released a patch, resulting in a fork that nullified the illegitimate creation of billions of bitcoins. Other notable discussions Nakamoto participated in concerned the introductions of Bitcoin versions 0.3.1, 0.3.6, and 0.3.10. Bitcoin’s inventor also touched upon the network’s difficulty in five instances and the development of an alert system around seven times. 2009 was more about the release of Bitcoin version 0.2.2, questions, and a “few suggestions.”
Nakamoto’s online presence spanned just over two years. However, his digital footprint in 2008 was limited, given it was late in the year, and his activity in 2009 was modest compared to 2010. That year, Nakamoto significantly increased his online communications, concluding his public online interactions on Dec. 12, 2010. While he made his last public forum post in 2010, emails to Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen reportedly took place in 2011 after Nakamoto had stepped back from the public eye.
The mysterious architect behind Bitcoin left an indelible mark in just over two years online. These writings, spanning a myriad of topics, showcased a visionary deeply engaged in the project’s evolution. While the world may never fully unravel the mystery of Nakamoto’s identity, the digital legacy of Bitcoin’s creator remains an intriguing testament to the power of innovation and the allure of anonymity.

Bitcoin Price Forecasts at $56K Upon Approval of BlackRock ETF;"The cryptocurrency market witnessed an unexpected surge in excitement due to the circulation of false reports suggesting that the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] had approved BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund [ETF]. This erroneous information resulted in a sudden and sharp increase in Bitcoin [BTC] prices, pushing them to the $30,000 mark. This unanticipated frenzy highlighted the robust demand for regulated BTC investment products. This left many in the crypto community both intrigued and skeptical about the SEC’s true intentions.
Matrixport’s recent research analysis has illuminated the potential repercussions of BlackRock’s BTC ETF receiving regulatory approval on Bitcoin’s price. The study reveals two distinct scenarios, offering valuable insights into how the market might react to such an approval.
The first scenario represents a conservative estimate. The research envisions that if the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF secures regulatory clearance, Bitcoin’s price could experience a significant upswing. It could reach an estimated level of approximately $42,000. This projection underscores the strong market demand for a regulated BTC investment vehicle. It also upholds the positive sentiment that such an approval could trigger.
The second scenario is more optimistic. It takes into account the potential impact of a substantial influx of capital into the BTC market resulting from the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF’s approval. Should an impressive $50 billion flow into the market in response to the approval, Bitcoin’s price may experience an even more substantial surge. This optimistic projection anticipates a price increase that could propel BTC to reach roughly $56,000.
At press time, BTC was trading at $28,443.29 with a 0.12% daily rise. It should be noted that BTC surged by 6.33% over the last week.

Bitcoin’s price journey has been characterized by significant peaks and valleys, offering opportunities for a diverse range of participants in the market. Throughout its history, BTC has undergone numerous cycles of bullish and bearish sentiment, leading to substantial price fluctuations. In 2017, BTC attracted significant global interest when its price skyrocketed to nearly $20,000 before undergoing a substantial correction. This remarkable surge served as an initial introduction to the realm of cryptocurrencies for many individuals. Subsequently, Bitcoin has consistently maintained its allure among both investors and institutional players.

Two of the most prominent names in this regard are Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, and Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla. What sets their entry into the Bitcoin market apart is the price range at which they acquired their Bitcoin holdings, notably between $25,000 and $30,000.

Bitcoin Maximalist Calls Ethereum ‘Garbage’, Here’s Why;"Ethereum has long been the target of criticism from die-hard Bitcoin maximalists who believe that Bitcoin is the only worthwhile cryptocurrency despite the fact that Ethereum holds the second-highest percentage of the entire cryptocurrency market value. 
Now, another Bitcoin maximalist, Steve Barbour, has referred to the leading platform for smart contracts as garbage. 
In a social media post on X, the prominent Bitcoin enthusiast recently called Ethereum “garbage” and said it has no future. His argument essentially boils down to Ethereum failing to attract investors from the free market and nothing else. 
Ethereum is garbage. The free market doesn’t want it and the captured market still can’t figure out what it is for.
— Steve Barbour (@SGBarbour) October 16, 2023
Barbour is the founder of Upstream Data, a mining infrastructure company building off-grid Bitcoin mining rigs. His claim comes behind the heels of Ethereum staking rewards falling to new lows. 
The number of Ethereum in staking pools has been steadily growing over the past few months; however, this has not been accompanied by increased profitability. According to CoinGecko, liquid staking protocols accounted for 43.7% of the total 26.4 million ETH staked in August 2023. 
The annual percentage yield (APY) from ETH staking has decreased over the years, going from 18% in 2020 to 3% in October. Since 2022, these protocols have paid out 100,000 ETH in quarterly incentives for staking, but the low APY has led many investors to question if staking ETH is still worthwhile.
Barbour and other Bitcoin maximalists claim that Ethereum is not as decentralized as Bitcoin, particularly given that the blockchain has recently moved from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus process. 
Most of them believe that Bitcoin is the sole “true” cryptocurrency and that all other cryptocurrencies are worthless. Bitcoin maximalists have also been critical of other cryptocurrencies apart from Ethereum. Max Kaiser, another strong supporter of Bitcoin, has lately asserted that XRP is centralized.

Ethereum has proven itself to be more than garbage, as evident in its vast number of supporters and large ecosystem. However, some supporters of Bitcoin agreed with the maximalist.
Agreed. It’s full of speculators

The free market has Ethereum now at $1,550. ETH has witnessed a 1.65% drop in price in the past 24 hours, and it continues to stay weaker against Bitcoin. 
On the other hand, Bitcoin has increased in dominance against altcoins. Most of the money and attention has flowed into Bitcoin, and the crypto has witnessed a 6.39% increase in the past seven days. 
As a result, ETH bulls have struggled to push above $1,600 and the crypto is now trading around the $1,550 support zone. If bulls fail to hold this level, it could start another decline to as low as $1,430.

We Asked ChatGPT if the SEC Will Approve a Spot Bitcoin ETF This Year;"TL;DR

The crypto community cheered yesterday’s reports indicating that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approved BlackRock’s application to introduce a spot BTC ETF in America. However, this turned out to be fake news, and the price gains registered by most digital assets and the overall enthusiasm quickly evaporated.
Still, the question of whether the first spot BTC ETF would go live in the US anytime soon remains a top trending topic in the space. We asked ChatGPT if this development could see the light of day before the end of 2023.
The AI-powered language model suggested this could become a reality, assuming several crucial factors are in place. The regulatory environment was labeled as the most important element:
“The SEC, for example, has expressed concerns about market manipulation, custody, and investor protection in the context of Bitcoin ETFs. Changes in the regulatory landscape can impact the likelihood of approval.”
Market maturity and custody solutions were also outlined as key factors for the regulator to say “yes” eventually. Proposals that address market manipulation concerns, enhanced investor protection, and favorable public opinion might influence the decision, too. 
We previously asked ChatGPT whether next year could witness a price rally for the primary cryptocurrency. According to the result, such a surge could be propelled by ten vital factors, including increased supply and demand, institutional interest, regulatory developments, massive purchases from giant institutions, and others. 
The language model further estimated that BTC could jump to its ATH of almost $70,000 in 2024 due to a potential overall bullish year, positive momentum, and a successful halving event.
The Bitcoin halving is scheduled for the following spring and will reduce the reward miners receive for adding new blocks on the blockchain. The event has historically resulted in a bull run for the leading digital asset.
Meanwhile, on a rather unrelated note, we recently released a video on how many Bitcoin billionaires there are in the world, and the answer might shock you. Check it out here:

Global Bitcoin ATMs sink to 2021 lows – Can BTC ETFs save the industry?;"The crypto world has its fair share of up and down surges, as witnessed by events in recent years. Bitcoin has long since solidified its position and has been a force to reckon with, as it has fostered many innovations in the digital space. However, there are other developments it has made that have gone under the radar. 
One such innovation is the Bitcoin Auto Teller Machines (ATMs) commonly termed as BTMs. These innovations have been widespread all across the globe, but recent data shows the dwindling use as the number of Bitcoin ATMs has plummeted to the lowest level since 2021. 
However, the approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) could mean a better future for Bitcoin in the crypto space. 
Bitcoin ATMs have been an essential bridge in linking fiat or physical cash and digital currencies. In this case, bitcoin ATMs serve to offer Bitcoin exchange of BTC tokens to fiat, or vice versa. BTMs have made BTC more accessible to anyone around the globe. However, the number of BTC ATMs has reduced, hitting its all-time low since 2021. 
Since 2022, the number of installed BTC ATMs has dropped by 7,000, indicating a 17% drop. This is according to data from AltIndix reported on Wednesday. Currently, the number of installed BTC ATMs is recorded at 32,500 this year. 
The United States holds the highest number of BTMs, and the numbers also show a decline in their installation across the region. It has a higher number 18 times the ATMs installed across Europe, which hosts over 1,400 BTMs. 
There are various reasons that have led to this decline in installations, among them being scammers placing ads on sites like eBay and asking buyers to deposit funds in BTC on specific BTC wallets. The funds later vanished. 
According to Brandon Mintz, the Chief Executive Officer  (CEO) and founder of the publicly traded bitcoin ATM operator Bitcoin Deport (BTM) stated that the dwindling number of BTMs is based on ATMs going out of business or closure of unprofitable BTMs. He was quoted stating:
This creates an opportunity for us that allows us to further increase market share through acquisitions and organic kiosk growth in additional retail locations.
The recent news sentiments on the crypto Exchange Traded Funds have been long awaited, and its approval by the SEC could mean a lot for the crypto community. Upon approval of the BlackRock spot BTC ETF, BTC’s price could surge to a peak close to $56,000, just shy of its all-time high. The Matrixport report stated:
Assuming that 10-20% of those precious metals ETF investors seek to diversify their investments into BTC. We can estimate potential inflows of $12-24 billion into the BTC ETF. While the market cap of GBTC is currently only $17-18 billion, it reached a peak of $44 billion. Therefore, our estimate of $12-24 billion is relatively conservative.
After BlackRock filed for its spot BTC ETF in mid-June on the 15th, BTC’s price rose from $24,800 to $30,000 in a span of just 7 days. Matrixport also reported, “15,000-strong U.S. registered investor advisor (RIA) community is overseeing around $5 trillion. This group holds immense potential, and even a modest 1% allocation recommendation for Bitcoin would usher in around $50 billion in inflows.”
According to Matrixport, a crypto service provider, their report on Thursday explained that the ETF approval could surge BTC’s price with the lowest end at $42,000. This is based on data assumptions that 10%-20% of investors in gold ETF are likely to support the spot BTC ETF.

The crypto world has its fair share of up and down surges, as witnessed by events in recent years. Bitcoin has long since solidified its position and has been a force to reckon with, as it has fostered many innovations in the digital space. However, there are other developments it has made that have gone under the radar. 
One such innovation is the Bitcoin Auto Teller Machines (ATMs) commonly termed as BTMs. These innovations have been widespread all across the globe, but recent data shows the dwindling use as the number of Bitcoin ATMs has plummeted to the lowest level since 2021. 
However, the approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) could mean a better future for Bitcoin in the crypto space. 
Bitcoin ATMs have been an essential bridge in linking fiat or physical cash and digital currencies. In this case, bitcoin ATMs serve to offer Bitcoin exchange of BTC tokens to fiat, or vice versa. BTMs have made BTC more accessible to anyone around the globe. However, the number of BTC ATMs has reduced, hitting its all-time low since 2021. 
Since 2022, the number of installed BTC ATMs has dropped by 7,000, indicating a 17% drop. This is according to data from AltIndix reported on Wednesday. Currently, the number of installed BTC ATMs is recorded at 32,500 this year. 
The United States holds the highest number of BTMs, and the numbers also show a decline in their installation across the region. It has a higher number 18 times the ATMs installed across Europe, which hosts over 1,400 BTMs.

Getting Grandma Into Web 3.0;"Mass adoption is the elusive ‘Holy Grail’ of any consumer technology, and something that has been written and thought about a lot as it relates to the emerging Web 3.0 industry.
But how does one measure something like ‘mass adoption’? Would it be based on the number of users? Or the revenue generated by the industries that built the technology?
Maybe it’s better to measure mass adoption of consumer technologies by something else. Albert Einstein famously said that, “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”
So, maybe the best way to measure the mass adoption of Web 3.0 is to ask whether or not it has become so simple that your grandmother can explain it, and more importantly, use it.
Grandma knows what’s up
My grandmother is as sharp as a tack. She’s college-educated, reads voraciously and is a master of many subjects. Information technology, however, is not her strong suit.
Like many of her generation, she feels that ‘newfangled’ computer technologies are needlessly opaque, difficult and dangerous to navigate and endlessly changing.
Which, even to a technologist like me, I must admit is a valid criticism, especially when it comes to Web 3.0.
If you come right down to it, crypto, blockchain and Web 3.0, in general, are complicated. It’s a world chock-full of prototypes competing for attention and funding.
Almost everything is still in beta. Almost nothing has regulatory clarity in most major jurisdictions, let alone approval.
And when it comes to the most important part of adoption for consumer technologies, it leaves a lot to be desired to say the least.
It’s hard to measure exactly how many Web 3.0 users there are, but JP Morgan recently highlighted the decline in ETH transactions following their much heralded Shanghai upgrade, calling it ‘disappointing.’
Bitcoin shows some disappointing realities too. According to a recent report by Chainalysis, there are now over 460 million Bitcoin addresses – but over 288 million of those hold no balance or were used only once, and of the wallets identified by Chainalysis to be ‘economically relevant,’ only 27 million actually hold any Bitcoin.
It is estimated that although nearly 90% of people have heard of Bitcoin or crypto, only 2.7% of the global population actually holds any crypto.
The hashrate for Bitcoin hit a new all-time high in September of 2023, indicating that more miners than ever before are trying to mine new Bitcoin – but only about $7 billion worth of transactions involving Bitcoin were settled on centralized exchanges this year, markedly lower than $13.8 billion and $11 billion witnessed in 2021 and 2022 respectively.
In other words, almost everyone has heard of crypto and Web 3.0, but most users who try it leave and don’t come back.
Doesn’t seem like the kind of technology Grandma is going to be going out of her way to learn to use anytime soon.
A bigger problem than lack of adoption – people fleeing
But why do so many people leave Web 3.0? Well, the most obvious answer to me is that it’s just too hard to use. DeFi, DEXs, swaps, impermanent loss, yield farming, dollar cost averaging, abiding by complicated tax rules and the list goes on.
I’ve been in crypto for a long time, but to this day, every time I set up a new wallet I still have the unshakable feeling that someday I’m going to lose my 24-word seed phrase and be locked out of my wallet forever.
Imagine Grandma trying to keep track of that. I get tired just thinking about trying to explain what a ‘seed phrase’ is to mine.
Another problem is language. Mempool, halving, forking, airdrops, consensus, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, HODL and DAO.
If you turn Grandma loose on these words without a Web 3.0 dictionary, she’s sure to end up getting ‘rekt.’
Even crypto natives struggle with some of these terms. I know die-hard Bitcoin maximalists who disagree about whether the reduction of Bitcoin mining rewards should be called the ‘halving’ or the ‘halvening.’
Regardless of which of the two you prefer, Grandma’s going to stay out of Web 3.0 until we come up with language that she can understand.
Something else that scares a lot of users about Web 3.0 is that there’s no way back.
Transactions are final – even if you make a mistake. Didn’t mean to send all your ETH in that transaction? Too bad. Miss a step while trying to bridge some assets to layer two? That’s gone.
In November of 2022, Crypto.com accidentally sent 320,000 ETH – or about $400,000,000 – to the wrong recipient.
Just this past September, Paxos accidentally paid $500,000 in Bitcoin transaction fees and had to go ask the Bitcoin miners that had processed the transaction to return the money.
In both of these cases, the funds were recovered, but if Grandma makes a mistake like this, she’s just out of luck, and out of crypto.
Grandma isn’t joining Web 3.0 until it’s safe
This ties into what I think is still the biggest problem in Web 3.0 today – it’s dangerous. Even major businesses like Paxos and Crypto.com are making mistakes.
It seems like almost every day we hear about Mark Cuban’s crypto wallet getting hacked and losing $870,000 or Hong Kong starting to welcome Web 3.0 back only to immediately hear news of a $200 million DeFi hack.
As much as people in Web 3.0 like to make jokes about these kinds of mistakes, the rest of the world isn’t laughing. They’re scared.
No one wants to hit the wrong button or click a suspicious link and then have to sit and watch helplessly as all their funds disappear.
Web 3.0 is supposed to offer a trustless alternative to centralized legacy finance, but presently, all it seems to offer is a series of pitfalls with no safety nets and no way to climb out if you fall into one.
The effect of this combined with the still fresh reputational damage done by the likes of FTX, Terra Luna and many others, is more than enough to scare away even the most technically savvy investors and users – let alone Grandma.
If Mark Cuban can’t keep his hot wallet safe, you can bet your Bitcoin that Grandma isn’t going to feel comfortable using one anytime soon.
That said, it’s not all doom and gloom. These are still the early days, and Web 3.0 has already made and will continue to make huge leaps forward in both technical advancements and user adoption.
I have confidence in the promise of Web 3.0 and the ingenuity of this industry, but I think we would all do well to keep Grandma in mind when we’re discussing mass adoption – and especially when designing new applications and user experiences.
Until Grandma is using Web 3.0 without ever knowing who Satoshi Nakamoto is, we haven’t done our jobs, Web 3.0 hasn’t succeeded, and we’ll never truly reach that elusive Holy Grail.

Biggest Movers: BCH, SOL Big Gainers Following Cointelegraph’s ‘Inaccurate’ Tweet;"Bitcoin cash was a huge gainer on Monday, as the cryptocurrency rallied by as much as 14% in today’s session. The surge comes after Cointelegraph falsely suggested that Blackrock’s bitcoin ETF was approved by the SEC. An apology has since been issued, following the mistaken report. Solana also hit a multi-week high on the news.
Bitcoin cash was already ahead of the pack Monday, and then rose by as much as 14% in today’s session, after it was alleged by Cointelegraph that Blackrock’s bitcoin ETF was approved by the SEC.
The tweet has since been removed, with an apology being issued by the company for the mistake.
BCH/USD peaked at $242.77 following the news, however it has since slipped, and is now trading at $229.43.
Despite retreating from earlier highs, the cryptocurrency remains over 8% higher than Sunday’s low of $213.10.
One catalyst for the rise was a breakout which occurred on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
Price strength moved past a ceiling at the 55.00 mark, and as of writing is tracking at 56.44.
Solana (SOL) neared the $25.00 level to start the week, as bulls pushed price to a 14-day high.
After trading at a low of $21.71 on Sunday, SOL/USD raced to a peak of $24.41 earlier in today’s session.
This resulted in SOL hitting its highest level since October 2, however momentum has since shifted, with price now at $23.34.
Like with BCH above, a glide beyond a resistance zone appears to have been the signal bulls were waiting for to enter the market.
Currently, the index is tracking at 61.79, which comes following a surge past the aforementioned ceiling at 60.00.

Bitcoin asserts dominance with new year-to-date peak versus alts;"The crypto graph of 2023 paints an intriguing picture with a significant shift in investor sentiment. Bitcoin’s dominance has spiked to a compelling year-to-date high of 52.28%, casting a shadow over the performance of altcoins. The market’s flagship currency’s robust growth is echoed in the underperformance of its competitors.
On a YTD basis, many altcoins seem to have lost their footing against Bitcoin. XRP, once buoyed by a favorable resolution in its security classification, has slipped by 17%, nearly erasing its July gains. Meanwhile, Ethereum, a consistent performer in crypto, has recorded a 24% dip against Bitcoin.
The gap is more pronounced for ADA and BNB, which have plunged 43% and 50%, respectively, in comparison to Bitcoin. Among the biggest losers is Dogecoin, with a steep 52% decline against Bitcoin.
This data implies a potential shift in the crypto landscape, highlighting Bitcoin’s increasing clout amidst dynamics that seem to dwarf the value proposition of altcoins.

Price Rollercoaster Alert: Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), VeChain (VET) – What's About to Unfold?;"The broader crypto market is bubbling with anticipation, especially with the spotlight on the potential inflows from spot ETFs. When you compare it to the last bull market cycle, it seems that the funds coming in could eclipse the money that previously flowed into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). For those not in the loop, GBTC stands tall as the world's largest cryptocurrency fund, boasting a staggering $16.7 billion in assets under management.
Now let's do some math. CryptoQuant throws in an exciting projection: imagine the issuers keen on listing bitcoin ETFs divert just 1% of their Assets Under Management (AUM) to these ETFs. We could see an injection of approximately $155 billion into the bitcoin market. That's not chump change – it's nearly a third of bitcoin's current market cap. And if this plays out, we could be seeing bitcoin prices dancing between $50,000 and $73,000. Not to forget, historically, during past bull markets, for every dollar entering the bitcoin market, the market cap could balloon by $3-$5. Cryptocurrency sure knows how to throw a party!
Ethereum's validator queue experienced a significant shift, emptying for the first time since the Shanghai hardfork. This hints at stabilization in the demand for ETH stakes. Ethereum has been under pressure, consolidating below the 200-week average, with the 50-week average acting as resistance. Traders should watch for moves.
Technically, Ethereum has been charting lower highs and lower lows recently. The immediate support is between $1,300-$1,350, with the next level around $1,200. If Ethereum gains momentum, it could surge towards $1,600-$1,700. Conversely, if it doesn't find support, $1,200 is plausible.
Furthermore, if Ethereum breaks the resistance and makes a decisive close above the 200-week average, the doors might open for a retest of the recent highs above $1,800. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) will be critical indicators to monitor.
Litecoin, often referred to as the ""silver to Bitcoin's gold,"" has navigated its way through the complex crypto environment. It's vital to highlight that LTC recently interacted with several moving averages, such as crossing the 9-18 Day Moving Average at $81.9177 and the $9-40 Day Moving Average at 76.3557. Such interactions often indicate potential trend shifts, and traders should remain vigilant to these cues.
On the bullish front, traders might see an upside if LTC breaks through key resistances at $65.8791 and $64.8997, respectively. Should momentum pick up and these resistance levels be surmounted, we could anticipate an upward trajectory towards its 13-week or even 52-week highs.
However, in the event of a bearish turn, LTC could lean on several support levels. The immediate one to note is the support point at $60.0499. For a more pronounced downtrend, the 13-week low of $57.7743 and the 52-week low of $48.2221 are crucial safety nets.
While trade volumes, oscillators, and moving averages offer invaluable insights, these defined support and resistance levels will be pivotal in guiding the decision-making process for traders and investors in the upcoming period.
VeChain has been making waves in the crypto community as a blockchain platform focused on enhancing supply chain management. Recent technical data showcases some crucial inflection points for this digital asset.
On the bullish side, several resistances provide opportunities for upside potential. The highest resistance in recent times has been its 52-week high at $0.034000. Close behind, a 13-week high registers at $0.029874. In terms of more immediate resistances, the pivot point is at $0.019901. Breaching it  could signify a positive move towards its multi-month highs.
In a bearish scenario, VeChain (VET) can rely on a series of support levels. The immediate one is the support point of $0.018997. For more pronounced downward movements, the 13-week and 1-month lows, both at $0.018530, followed by the 52-week low of $0.015346, serve as significant markers.
Additionally, VeChain's interactions with various moving averages paint a picture of its recent behavior. For instance, the token recently crossed the 18-40 Day Moving Average at $0.090699, and the 9-40 Day Moving Average at $0.049273. Such crossovers often hint at evolving trends, whether they signal consolidation or a potential breakout.
While oscillators and moving averages provide deeper insights, the clearly outlined support and resistance levels from recent data will be instrumental for traders and investors looking to strategize their next move with VeChain.
The crypto market, with its unpredictable highs and lows, is never short of excitement. While the potential inflows from spot ETFs have the industry buzzing, individual assets like Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and VeChain (VET) each have their stories to tell. Traders and investors would do well to stay informed, nimble, and always, always do their homework.

Bitcoin Is Now Above This Historical Level, But For How Long?;"Bitcoin is now above a certain historical on-chain metric, and if the asset can continue to hold here, a bullish trend might follow.
As explained by an analyst in a post on X, BTC is now trading above the warm supply realized price. The “realized price” refers to the cost basis or buying price of the average investor in the Bitcoin market.
When the cryptocurrency’s spot price is trading above this metric, it means that the holders are in a state of profit right now. On the other hand, the asset being under the indicator suggests the dominance of loss in the market.
In the context of the current discussion, the realized price of only a specific segment of the supply is of interest: the “warm supply.” The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode defines the warm supply as that part of the supply that was last moved on the network between one week and six months ago.
The coins moved within the past week are in the “hot supply.” This section of supply is the most liquid, often involved in transactions.
The coins from this supply that stay still for a bit naturally mature into the warm supply cohort. The warm supply is still fluid but less so than the hot supply, where a large chunk of the coins are repeatedly traded in quick intervals.
The warm supply is where investor behavior starts becoming clearer since the hot supply is essentially churning repeatedly for various reasons, which can hide actual information about normal traders.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin realized price for the warm supply over the past year:

As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin realized price of the warm supply is currently trading around the $28,151 mark. Thus, with the latest surge in the spot price, the cryptocurrency has managed to break past this level.
This can be significant for the asset, as this line has held importance in the past. As mentioned before, the price breaking above the level essentially signifies that the holders of this supply have returned into a state of profit.
Generally, when investors who were previously at a loss start breaking even because of a surge in the price, they may become tempted to sell in fear that the asset would once again dip below their cost basis shortly. Exiting at the break-even mark at least ensures that they avoid any losses.
This selling that can arise at the cost basis of the group can show up as resistance to Bitcoin. Since the asset has cleared this boundary with the latest rally, it’s certainly a positive sign.
The analyst in the post notes that if Bitcoin can hold above this level, then a new uptrend could begin for the cryptocurrency.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $28,600, up 4% in the last week.

An SBF Testimony Could Add ‘Decades’ to His Prison Sentence, According to Lawyer – Here’s Why;"A pair of lawyers unaffiliated with Sam Bankman-Fried or FTX are weighing in on the possibility of the former CEO testifying during his ongoing trial.
In a new interview with Laura Shin on the Unchained Podcast, Sam Enzer, partner at law firm Cahill Gordon and Reindel, says he thinks Bankman-Fried would likely only make things worse for himself by testifying.
Says Enzer,
“[What] I would say to him is: ‘we’re going to lose, we’re not winning this trial, we have to think about sentencing. If you testify, you are going to add decades to your sentence, you’re not going to change the outcome and the judge will find, in addition to being guilty, that you not only didn’t accept responsibility but you tried to commit perjury and this is a judge who will really slam you for that. It’s a mistake.'”
On the other hand, Enzer also thinks that testifying is Bankman-Fried’s only shot at acquittal – and could be a desperate hail mary attempt to lower his sentence or be acquitted.
“Now I do think his only shot of an acquittal is to testify. The evidence is too overwhelming as far as I can tell… And the crosses have just not done enough to punch holes in the government’s case. The only way to give the jury a competing theory would be for him to testify, but I think even if he testified there’s just too much going against him, there’s too much headwind and so I would say don’t do it.” 
Greg Strong, partner at DLx Law, goes on to echo Enzer’s thoughts.
“I would agree with that. I think it’s going to be complicated by the fact that I strongly believe that he will want to testify. And ultimately, it’s his call so he has to take the advice of his lawyers. But just stepping back, my experience with people who have been able to accomplish widescale financial fraud, is that they do it because they can be very convincing.
 And if they are very convincing to a lot of people over a long period of time, they sort of believe that they have this ability to convince people whenever they want to. I think that’s sort of going to play into this question of whether or not he will testify, and that’s why I think he will want to testify because I think he will believe that he can convince people that he was you know maybe not as involved as as is being portrayed in the government’s case right now. But I think it would be a mistake.”
Last week, the former head of Alameda Research and Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, testified that she was directed by the defendant to commit several crimes. If convicted of his charges, the former FTX executive faces decades behind bars.

Terra Land in Chaos: Jump Trading in the Spotlight as SEC Intensifies Legal Action Against Do Kwon;"The post Terra Land in Chaos: Jump Trading in the Spotlight as SEC Intensifies Legal Action Against Do Kwon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
In every court hearing, a new layer is presented. Right now, the Terra land is full of chaos as the firm copes with misleading chat history, forged document claims, and whatnot! The latest is Jump Trading. Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs, is facing legal action over allegations of misleading investors regarding the terraUSD stablecoin, whose collapse in 2022 had significant repercussions in the crypto sphere. 
The case is now spotlighting market maker Jump Trading, which is believed to have profited substantially as the ecosystem crumbled. The collapse of the terraUSD stablecoin in May 2022 had a profound impact on the crypto market, signaling the onset of crypto winter. Kwon is facing a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly providing false information to investors.
Recent court documents highlight the critical role of Jump Trading in the case. But what is Jump trading? Shorting is a bet on price decline. An investor borrows and sells, with a target to repurchase at a lower price, profiting from the difference. 
That’s where the SEC intervened; the case hinges on an incident from the previous year, where UST briefly lost its peg to the dollar. While Kwon assured investors that the coin’s value remained stable thanks to its automated algorithm, the SEC contends that it was, in fact, Jump Trading’s intervention at Terraform’s request that maintained the peg. These conflicting narratives have become a central point of contention in the legal proceedings.
Kwon’s defense maintains that Jump Trading’s activities did not directly cause the peg restoration in May 2021. They argue that the de-pegging in May 2022 resulted from a deliberate attempt by third parties to short UST, prompting a public intervention to counteract the short.
Additionally, Elliptic’s analysis shows TerraUSD and Luna’s investors lost $42 billion, causing a widespread crypto crash affecting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether.
The defense team also argues that the SEC lacks jurisdiction, as the assets are currencies, not securities. This legal gray area mirrors ongoing cases involving exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. 
Kwon, arrested for possessing false ID documents in March, is currently detained in Montenegro. A recent biography of Sam Bankman-Fried indicated that Jump Trading incurred nearly $300 million in losses when FTX, Bankman-Fried’s exchange, faced a significant setback in November 2022.

Apple’s App Store Briefly Removes Crypto Wallet MetaMask, Coinbase CEO Says Antitrust Action May Be Needed;"Apple temporarily removed the crypto wallet MetaMask from its App Store, prompting Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong to suggest filing an antitrust action against the Silicon Valley giant.
MetaMask said it was aware that Apple users were not able to download its app, but that the issue wasn’t related to anything malicious.
The company also warned of the possibility that scammers may take advantage of the situation by advertising phishing traps posing as the real MetaMask.
“If you come across any fake MetaMask apps on the App Store, please report them immediately. Our top priority is to get this sorted out quickly and protect users from any fake apps.”
Solana (SOL) co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko commented on the situation, saying that an alternative to Google Play and Apple’s App Store is becoming more necessary.
“It’s like we need an alternative app store or something. I feel like it’s going to take an act of Congress to force side-loading apps on all ‘operating systems.’
Apple is incredibly hard to compete with on product. You can make better hardware, but it will cost more and will take longer to ship.”
In response to Yakovenko, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says the problem may be addressed by the antitrust law, which aims to promote competition and prevent companies from taking unjustified control of the market.
“Yes – or antitrust action.”

Hedera (HBAR) Q3 Triumph: Transaction Volume Soars, Network Revenue Crosses 1M Milestone;"According to a recent report by the online database platform Messari, the Hedera (HBAR) Network, an open-source, public blockchain governed by the Hedera Governing Council, has showcased significant growth in the face of a challenging crypto market during Q3 2023. 
Per the report, Hedera Network’s transaction volume continued its upward trajectory, achieving a new record of 99 million daily average transactions in Q3 2023. 
This milestone marks the fifth consecutive quarterly increase in transaction activity, with the Hedera Consensus Service responsible for 99% of all transactions on the network. 
Notably, the network’s revenue derived from transaction fees surpassed $1 million for the first time, experiencing a remarkable 30% quarter-on-quarter growth. 
According to Messari, the Hedera Consensus Service largely drove the revenue growth and remained independent of HBAR’s price fluctuations, as transaction fees are fixed in USD terms.
While the overall crypto market experienced a moderate downturn during Q3 2023, HBAR’s circulating market capitalization grew by 7.6% quarter-on-quarter, reaching $1.7 billion by the end of September. 
HBAR’s fully diluted market capitalization also increased by 2.5%, settling at $2.5 billion. As a result, the Hedera Network emerged as the 31st-largest crypto protocol by market capitalization, demonstrating its growing prominence in the industry.
The protocol’s Total Value Locked (TVL) reached $31 million in Q3 2023, a 29% increase from the previous quarter. While the broader market witnessed a reduction in TVL, Hedera’s year-over-year (YoY) TVL growth stood at an impressive 75%. 
SaucerSwap, the leading protocol within the Hedera ecosystem, accounted for most of the TVL, with $27 million locked, comprising 87% of the Hedera Network’s total TVL. According to Messari, this growth in TVL can be attributed to the launch of new protocols within the ecosystem.
On the flip side, the Hedera community has strongly emphasized enhancing developer tools and collaborations. 
In Q3 2023, significant progress was made toward achieving Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence. The community introduced developer-focused features, integrated the JSON-RPC codebase, and refined contract creation transactions through HIP-729. 
These efforts have increased compatibility with EVM networks and expanded the capabilities of smart contract development on the Hedera Network.
The Hedera Network reported a high staking percentage, with 85% of the circulating supply and 56% of the total supply staked. 
Core entities such as the HBAR Foundation, Swirlds, and Swirlds Labs have staked their HBAR allocations and the Hedera Treasury to support validators in meeting the minimum staking threshold for network consensus. Notably, these entities have chosen not to collect staking rewards. 
Per the report, the Hedera Governing Council modified the staking rewards structure during Q3, adjusting the reward rate to 2.5% and setting a maximum staked quantity to ensure proportional reward rates.
Despite the challenging crypto market conditions in Q3 2023, the Hedera Network has showcased significant growth. The expansion of TVL and the dominance of SaucerSwap further solidified the ecosystem’s position. 
Despite the growth of Hedera Network’s ecosystem, the native token, HBAR, is currently trading at $0.0460, reflecting a 4.5% decrease in value over the past 24 hours. This trend has persisted throughout the year, resulting in a year-to-date decline of 24%.

Grayscale Submits New Spot Bitcoin ETF Application to SEC;"Crypto asset manager Grayscale has filed another application with the SEC seeking approval for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). On October 19th, Grayscale submitted a registration to list its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares on the NYSE Arca exchange under the ticker GBTC. This represents the firm’s ongoing pursuit of converting the trust into an ETF.
The filing incorporates Grayscale’s prior disclosures as a registered security since 2020. Approval requires the SEC to sign off on the NYSE Arca application and Grayscale’s registration going effective.
Also read: Basel Committee Proposes New Crypto Disclosure Rules for Banks
This latest application comes after the crypto asset manager won a lawsuit against the SEC in September. In turn, the agency was required to reexamine its rejection of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The company also expressed its commitment to continue working with regulators on ETF approval.
The company joins several other major players, like BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Fidelity, seeking the SEC’s green light for a Bitcoin ETF.

While the SEC has moved slowly on approvals so far, increased pressure from leading firms and recent legal developments appear to be pushing the process forward.
Crypto investors still await concrete progress. However, Grayscale’s persistence reflects growing industry optimism around an eventual spot Bitcoin ETF launch after years of setbacks.

Bitcoin Price Surges 7% In 10 Minutes On Fake iShares ETF News;"Bitcoin price just made one of its most volatile moves in some time on the back of what has amounted to be fake news regarding the approval of the BlackRock iShares spot BTC ETF.
Within seconds of a fake X post, BTCUSD surged by over 7% in ten minutes – only to retrace the entire rally and then some.
No, BlackRock’s iShares spot Bitcoin ETF has not been approved. But that’s what was just making waves around social media, especially Elon Musk’s X platform.
Within the ten minutes following the phony report from CoinTelegraph, BTCUSD soared by more than 7%  and almost $2,000. The top cryptocurrency by market cap, however, was stopped at $30,000 and rejected all the way back down to below $28,000 in the following fifteen minutes once the news was disproven.
Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett claims to have spoken to a representative for BlackRock directly, who confirmed that the iShares application is still under review with the United States SEC. CoinTelegraph has since deleted the tweet (pictured below).

The situation shows that the market has serious pent up energy that is ready to release the moment a spot ETF is approved. But it also could demonstrate to the SEC exactly why a spot ETF shouldn’t be approved when crypto prices are subject to such blatant manipulation through the media.
While a spot ETF is inevitable at this point, today’s news has now repeatedly been confirmed to be false.

Greenpeace’s Bitcoin Lie Destroyed In ‘Most Politely Brutal Post’ Ever;"Troy Cross, Professor of Philosophy and Humanities at Reed College, launched a vehement response to Greenpeace’s ongoing criticisms about Bitcoin’s environmental impact. An advisor to several Bitcoin and energy organizations, Cross’s post not only defended BTC but also exposed gaps in Greenpeace’s stance, prompting the post to make waves in the community.
Lyn Alden, a prominent figure in the macro world, commented, “I think this is the most politely brutal post I have ever read on this app. Like, every time I thought it might start to wrap up, the constructive savagery only grew.” Echoing Alden’s sentiments, Jamie Coutts of Bloomberg Intelligence labeled Cross’s post as a “supremely articulate take down.”
In his comprehensive analysis, Cross tackled a multitude of claims made by Greenpeace. He began by questioning the organization’s genuine intent to understand or change BTC’s code, citing their lack of initiative in hiring experts or fostering collaboration with eco-conscious figures within the BTC community.
Cross remarked, “Greenpeace USA has shown no interest in actually changing Bitcoin’s code. Else, they would have hired someone to explore the technical options… Nor have they engaged with the content of the KPMG report they casually dismiss.”
Cross also directed attention to Greenpeace’s apparent lack of understanding about crucial energy dynamics related to BTC. He cited their apparent unawareness of the potential of methane mitigation in both oil fields and landfills and their unfamiliarity with the concept of ‘location agnosticism’ in the context of an energy system constrained by transmission capabilities.
He further elucidated the potential of Bitcoin to exploit the cheapest global electricity, hinting at its prospective positive role in the broader energy transition. “They’d have learned that Bitcoin is driven to find the cheapest electricity in the world, and such a buyer, if flexible, portable, and scalable, is, in the long run, a good thing for the energy transition… They haven’t,” the expert remarked.
One of Cross’s most stinging critiques centered on Greenpeace’s modus operandi. He contended, “What HAVE they done? Hector Bitcoiners. Shame is their only tool.”
Going further, he insinuated that Greenpeace might be pushing an agenda that serves the vested interests of certain donors rather than genuine environmentalism. He hinted, “Their underlying motive seems more aligned with creating reputational risk for Bitcoin enthusiasts and pushing for anti-Bitcoin legislation.”
Cross also drew parallels with the nuclear energy sector, noting how both were initially misunderstood as emerging technologies. However, he accentuated BTC’s distinction, emphasizing it as a people-driven movement with tens of thousands of informed supporters. “But nuclear [power] wasn’t a people’s movement. Bitcoin is. There are tens of thousands of us who are educated… And we’re defending home turf.”
Concluding his detailed post, Cross highlighted the ongoing innovations in BTC mining and pointed to the absurdity of previous alarmist predictions. He referenced the 2017 Newsweek/WEF headline that inaccurately claimed BTC would consume all of the world’s energy by 2020. With a final nod to the resilience and innovation of the community, he confidently proclaimed, “We are going to win.”
In this fiery and data-laden retort, Cross not only debunked Greenpeace’s claims but also laid down a gauntlet for a more informed and nuanced debate on the intersection of Bitcoin and environmental sustainability.
At press time, BTC traded at $28,430, up 2.1% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price to Hit $40K in Next 70 Days – Here’s Why;"The post Bitcoin (BTC) Price to Hit $40K in Next 70 Days – Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
With the cryptocurrency market buzzing and speculations making the rounds, one expert believes that Bitcoin’s price has a promising horizon. According to a recent statement by renowned crypto analyst Crypto Rover, BTC has robust reasons to see a massive surge in its value in the upcoming months.
One of the significant factors behind this optimistic outlook is the expectation of a whopping $300 billion influx into the Bitcoin market during the first twelve months of the ETF’s existence. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasn’t objected to Grayscale’s victory, suggesting a green light for Bitcoin Spot ETFs. 
#Bitcoin is going to hit $40,000 in the coming 70 days.And here is why:The former director of BlackRock is projecting a $300 billion inflow into the #Bitcoin market in the first year of the ETF's existence.Since the SEC hasn't appealed Grayscale's win, meaning they have no… pic.twitter.com/NsO9FGSYFl
With ARK’s initial application deadline slated for January 10, 2024, there’s much enthusiasm about the ETF approval’s influence after its market introduction. Some suggest this massive buying pressure could even thrust Bitcoin towards an astounding $100,000, making the $40,000 mark seem rather conservative, says Crypto Rover.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades around $28,333. A closer look at a 4-hour chart reveals some intriguing patterns. The crypto king’s immediate resistance level is $28,652. Those monitoring Bitcoin’s progress would notice sequential resistance levels at $29,100, $29,520, and then at $30,600.
While Bitcoin faces specific resistance points, it also finds potential cushioning at $27,700, which may descend further to $27,300 and $26,600. A key focus point is the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), presently at $27,500.
Bitcoin’s price standing above this EMA hints at a positive short-term swing. Moreover, if Bitcoin can break past the significant $28,500 barrier, which looks like a double peak, its growth could see more momentum.
From a technical standpoint, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) moderately favors Bitcoin. With an RSI value of 63, it’s positioned above the neutral 50 mark, indicating a positive market sentiment.

The post Bitcoin (BTC) Price to Hit $40K in Next 70 Days – Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
With the cryptocurrency market buzzing and speculations making the rounds, one expert believes that Bitcoin’s price has a promising horizon. According to a recent statement by renowned crypto analyst Crypto Rover, BTC has robust reasons to see a massive surge in its value in the upcoming months.
One of the significant factors behind this optimistic outlook is the expectation of a whopping $300 billion influx into the Bitcoin market during the first twelve months of the ETF’s existence. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasn’t objected to Grayscale’s victory, suggesting a green light for Bitcoin Spot ETFs.

With ARK’s initial application deadline slated for January 10, 2024, there’s much enthusiasm about the ETF approval’s influence after its market introduction. Some suggest this massive buying pressure could even thrust Bitcoin towards an astounding $100,000, making the $40,000 mark seem rather conservative, says Crypto Rover.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades around $28,333. A closer look at a 4-hour chart reveals some intriguing patterns. The crypto king’s immediate resistance level is $28,652. Those monitoring Bitcoin’s progress would notice sequential resistance levels at $29,100, $29,520, and then at $30,600.

This Rare Bullish Bitcoin Crossover Could Soon Form, Quant Predicts When;"A rare bullish crossover between two on-chain metrics could soon be forming for Bitcoin. Here’s when this analyst believes the cross would happen.
As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, a bullish crossover is expected to happen soon for BTC. The indicator of interest here is the “realized price,” which basically keeps track of the price at which the average investor in the Bitcoin market acquired their coins.
The indicator calculates this value by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last transacted at. The metric assumes this price to be its buying price and so, after taking the mean of this value for all tokens on the network, the average cost basis of all coins is obtained.
When the cryptocurrency’s price is under this metric, it means that the average holder in the sector is in a state of loss. On the other hand, the price being above the indicator implies the overall market is enjoying net profits.
The realized price of the entire user base isn’t of relevance in the context of the current discussion, but two specific UTXO age bands which are 6 months to 12 months and 12 months to 18 months. What these age bands signify is that the coins (or more accurately, UTXOs) belonging to them were last moved inside their range.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin realized price for these two UTXO age bands over the past few years:

As displayed in the above graph, the realized price of the UTXOs sitting dormant between 12 and 18 months ago has been heading down for a while now. The 6-month to 12 months age band had been showing a similar trajectory earlier in the year, but a while back, the metric plateaued and has since then turned itself around.
The reason the average cost basis of investors belonging to this age band has reversed its trajectory is that the 6 months cutoff for the group now lies in April, which means that those who bought during the rally in the starting months of the year would now be counted under this cohort.
Earlier in the year, the bear market buyers were a part of the group, so the average naturally headed down. The 12-month to 18-month-old group, on the other hand, still constitutes these bear market buyers, hence why its realized price is still decreasing.
If these two metrics continue in their current trajectories, they will go through a crossover. As the quant has highlighted in the chart, such a crossover where the 6 months to 12 months band has broken above the 12 months to 18 months cohort, has historically proven to be bullish for the asset.
In total, there have only been four such crossovers in the cryptocurrency’s entire history, so if this crossover goes on to form, it would only be the fifth ever. The analyst believes that November 28, 2023, is when this bullish crossover could be expected to form for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin had made a push toward the $29,000 level yesterday, but it appears the surge has already calmed down as the coin has retraced towards $28,400.

Crypto Analysts Predict Bitcoin Price After Real Spot ETF Approval;"In a startling turn of events, false information regarding the approval of the iShares Bitcoin Spot ETF by BlackRock sparked a massive Bitcoin price surge yesterday, resulting in the premier cryptocurrency reaching a two-month high of approximately $30,200 (on Bitfinex). Even though Bitcoin retraced this move shortly after the revelation of the misinformation, the rapid price movement has left many crypto analysts speculating on the potential price impact should a Bitcoin Spot ETF gain genuine approval.
Remarkably, BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, remained a vocal supporter of Bitcoin following the event, stating in a TV interview yesterday that it exemplifies the “pent-up interest in crypto.” Due to securities laws and the pending ETF application, he refrained from mentioning “Bitcoin” directly. But Fink emphasized the growing demand, noting, “We’re hearing from clients around the world about the need for crypto,” and even referred to Bitcoin as a “flight to quality.”
Reflecting on the market’s swift reaction to the fake news, macro analyst Alex Krüger remarked, “One thing is for sure. Whoever thinks the ETF is already priced in has just been proven wrong. Expect a +20% day move when approved.” However, a user named Troy countered this, suggesting that the market’s reaction was due to the unexpected nature of the news. Krüger responded, emphasizing that the SEC’s ETF news “rarely leaks” and would “likely still be front-runned”, especially by individuals already engaged in the crypto space.
Supporting this viewpoint, Christopher Inks, a seasoned trader and market psychology expert, responded, “I don’t disagree. Breaking out above ~$31K should see price rallying into $38-$40K as I’ve been saying.” He added, “Make no mistake, Bitcoin has been rallying for ~5 weeks already. Weekly chart gives a pretty clear five waves up and today’s pump follows the usual wedge completion scenario with an impulsive breakout above wedge resistance and immediate drop back into the wedge.”
Eric Weiss, the founder & CIO of the Blockchain Investment Group, commented on X (formerly known as Twitter), advising individuals, “You just got a slight glimpse of what the reaction to a spot Bitcoin ETF approval will look like. Act accordingly.”
Weiss elaborated on the potential long-term impact, stating that the real price appreciation will stem from “the ETFs taking in USD and buying Bitcoin, which will create a significant supply/demand imbalance and likely drive up the price of Bitcoin to all-time highs.”
Adding to the debate, Jeff Dorman, CIO at investment firm Arca, highlighted the significance of actual flows over announcements, stating, “Announcements don’t matter. Flows matter. Doesn’t matter how many headlines we get regarding a spot Bitcoin ETF approval. No one is front running this news.”
He argued that true price action will manifest when the ETF gets authentic approval and large firms, such as BlackRock, commence their marketing initiatives. James Christoph responded, emphasizing the market’s predictive nature based on announcements. Dorman retorted, asserting that the real game begins post-approval. “An ETF approval is 100% guaranteed and well known. The only question is when.”
Dorman’s perspective draws from the historical trajectory of gold. The approval of the inaugural gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States in 2004 saw gold’s value rise dramatically. Gold’s value surged by roughly 350% over a decade, influenced by factors like enhanced investor accessibility and amplified demand driven by ETF issuers promoting gold as a vital portfolio asset.
Given that financial giants such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco are queuing up with their respective spot ETFs, a similar trend for Bitcoin is projected by many analysts.
At press time, the BTC price was at 28,473, above the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at around $28,200, which also marked the key resistance over the past two months.

Crypto Payments: Gaming Giant Roblox Responds To XRP Support News;"The crypto industry has been subjected to false news yet again. Earlier this week, news broke that gaming giant Roblox has begun supporting XRP payments. However, the global gaming platform has publicly denied any claims that have made the rounds on social media.
Online gaming platform and gaming creation system, Roblox has denied all statements of supporting XRP payments or any other crypto-related payment method. A representative for the video game company reportedly told Decrypt that the information about integrating crypto payments was “inaccurate” and “simply false.”
The rumors started at the beginning of the week when Bitcoin payment service provider Bitpay, made a post on X (formerly Twitter) claiming that Xsolla, a video game company has started accepting cryptocurrency payments, among which was the XRP token. 
In the now-deleted post, Bitpay had tagged several gaming companies including Roblox and SMITE, which led to rumors spreading of the video game integrating the XRP payments method in its platform. 
BitPay has since retracted its announcement. However, the information had already spread across multiple networks and broadcasted on many news outlets. 
For now, the video game still maintains its primary payment methods which include debit and credit cards, as well as Roblox Gift cards. The popular gaming company has made it clear that it does not enable or accept any form of cryptocurrency payment methods including Bitcoin. 

At the start of the week, a relentless wave of fake news and misinformation has swept through the crypto industry. Most of this information has remained unverified and lacks credibility. 
A fake report was distributed in multiple publications this week about the approval of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Following the release of the news, Bitcoin saw an uptick indicating a price rally.
Although the SEC has debunked the claims and cautioned against unverified information, a pro-Ripple lawyer, John E. Deaton publicly disputed the SEC’s statement, urging people to only trust information from independent judges and not to consider the SEC as the best source of information about news regarding the regulatory body. 
“I disagree with the SECGov’s latest statement. The best source of information about the SEC is NOT the SEC,” Deaton stated.
He added that “we look to Judges who are independent and serve as oversight and a check on the SEC, to help shape our view of the SEC.”

Bitcoin ETF Approval Anticipated To Trigger Fiat Influx Of $24-50 Billion;"In a recent report released by Matrixport, a digital assets financial services platform, the spotlight shifts beyond Bitcoin (BTC) as the eagerly anticipated approval of a Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could have far-reaching effects. 
According to the analysis, not only could the Bitcoin market experience a significant boost, but Tether (USDT) and the broader crypto market could also see positive outcomes.
Matrixport’s foresight, outlined in their 2023 outlook report published on December 9, 2022, projected a substantial crypto rally driven by factors such as lower US inflation and favorable macroeconomic conditions. 
This projection anticipated strong rebounds for Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), along with a notable decrease in volatility.
Surrounding the approval of these pending applications, a standout performer in the market has been Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), with its share prices surging by an impressive 167% year-to-date, outpacing Bitcoin’s 71% growth. 
While GBTC’s net-asset-value (NAV) discount marginally narrowed from -45% to -43% at the beginning of the year, the game-changing moment arrived when BlackRock announced its ETF application on June 15, 2023.
Matrixport’s earlier reports analyzed the US registered investor advisor (RIA) community, comprising approximately 15,000 advisors overseeing around $5 trillion. 
Recognizing the potential of this group, the report suggests that even a modest 1% allocation recommendation for Bitcoin would result in approximately $50 billion in inflows. 
Drawing a parallel with precious metals ETFs boasting an estimated $120 billion in market capitalization, and assuming that between 10-20% of precious metal ETF investors explore a Bitcoin ETF as a diversification tactic against monetary debasement and inflation hedges, the potential influx into the Bitcoin ETF could reach a significant $12-24 billion.
The report speculates on the implications for Tether’s market capitalization by looking at the potential impact of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF approval. 
Acting as a proxy for potential ETF inflows, a $24 billion increase in Tether’s market cap could conservatively push Bitcoin’s price to $42,000. With an even larger influx of $50 billion resulting from a 1% allocation by RIAs, Bitcoin could rally to $56,000.
Overall, Matrixport’s analysis sheds light on the potential ripple effects of Bitcoin ETF approval, extending beyond Bitcoin’s immediate market and encompassing Tether and the wider cryptocurrency landscape.
As market participants eagerly await regulatory decisions, the industry remains poised for potential growth and transformation.
As of the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency in the market, Bitcoin (BTC), is trading at $28,700, reflecting a 1.8% increase over the past 24 hours.
It is worth noting that BTC has successfully maintained the gains it has made since mid-September. During this period, the cryptocurrency broke its short-term downtrend structure after reaching its peak for the year at $31,800 on July 13.

Pro-XRP Lawyer Says Don’t Trust The SEC Following Spot Bitcoin ETF Fake News;"Pro-XRP legal expert John Deaton has come for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following its comment relating to the false Spot Bitcoin ETF approval post that was made by the media outlet Cointelegraph. 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Deaton stated that he disagrees with the SEC’s latest statement as the “best source of information about the SEC is not the SEC.” According to him, the Commission’s “confirmation bias and self-serving statements” already disqualified it in this regard. 
Here’s a surprise: I disagree with the @SECGov’s latest statement. The best source of information about the SEC is NOT the SEC. Confirmation bias and self-serving statements by the SEC disqualify it. Likewise, pissed off investors are too close to be objective. Therefore, we… https://t.co/8SPEI43ORM
— John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) October 16, 2023

The lawyer was reacting to the Commission’s X post, where it warned the general public to be careful about what they read on the internet (likely in relation to the Cointelegraph post) and stated that “the best source of information about the SEC is the SEC.”
Deaton also seemed to suggest that the Commission could not be objective in making its decisions (possibly about the ETH Gate and the SEC’s conflict of interest), and that was why the crypto community looked to the judges who are independent and can check the excesses of the SEC, to help shape their view of the Commission. 

Deaton wasn’t done yet as he further went on to refer to Grayscale’s victory against the SEC, where the court noted that the Commission had acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it denied Grayscale’s application to convert its GBTC fund to a Spot Bitcoin ETF. The lawyer highlighted the Commission’s incompetence as he noted how “easy” it was to defeat such a claim.
In what seemed to be him highlighting the court’s view of the Commission, he mentioned that the Court of Appeals in the Grayscale case “unanimously concluded” that the SEC’s denial of a Spot Bitcoin ETF was “utter nonsense.” The Commission, up until the Grayscale case, had stated that its primary reservation about the fund was that it is susceptible to market manipulation. 
However, the Appellate Court adopted Grayscale’s argument that the Spot and Futures market (of which the SEC has approved Bitcoin futures ETFs) were correlated. As such, there was no reason why it would deny a Spot Bitcoin ETF and approve a futures ETF when they seem to share the same risk regarding market manipulation. 
Meanwhile, Deaton also alluded to the fact that a federal judge had once called the SEC’s lawyers hypocrites and that they lacked faithful allegiance to the law. With this in mind, this is why the legal expert has chosen to listen to the judges when it comes to issues relating to the SEC.
His comments come at a time when the crypto community seems to be looking up to the courts for direction on how the industry should be regulated in the wake of the SEC’s continued clampdown on several stakeholders in the industry.

Here’s a surprise: I disagree with the @SECGov’s latest statement. The best source of information about the SEC is NOT the SEC. Confirmation bias and self-serving statements by the SEC disqualify it. Likewise, pissed off investors are too close to be objective. Therefore, we… https://t.co/8SPEI43ORM
— John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) October 16, 2023

The lawyer was reacting to the Commission’s X post, where it warned the general public to be careful about what they read on the internet (likely in relation to the Cointelegraph post) and stated that “the best source of information about the SEC is the SEC.”
Deaton also seemed to suggest that the Commission could not be objective in making its decisions (possibly about the ETH Gate and the SEC’s conflict of interest), and that was why the crypto community looked to the judges who are independent and can check the excesses of the SEC, to help shape their view of the Commission. 

Deaton wasn’t done yet as he further went on to refer to Grayscale’s victory against the SEC, where the court noted that the Commission had acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it denied Grayscale’s application to convert its GBTC fund to a Spot Bitcoin ETF. The lawyer highlighted the Commission’s incompetence as he noted how “easy” it was to defeat such a claim.
In what seemed to be him highlighting the court’s view of the Commission, he mentioned that the Court of Appeals in the Grayscale case “unanimously concluded” that the SEC’s denial of a Spot Bitcoin ETF was “utter nonsense.” The Commission, up until the Grayscale case, had stated that its primary reservation about the fund was that it is susceptible to market manipulation. 
However, the Appellate Court adopted Grayscale’s argument that the Spot and Futures market (of which the SEC has approved Bitcoin futures ETFs) were correlated. As such, there was no reason why it would deny a Spot Bitcoin ETF and approve a futures ETF when they seem to share the same risk regarding market manipulation. 
Meanwhile, Deaton also alluded to the fact that a federal judge had once called the SEC’s lawyers hypocrites and that they lacked faithful allegiance to the law. With this in mind, this is why the legal expert has chosen to listen to the judges when it comes to issues relating to the SEC.
His comments come at a time when the crypto community seems to be looking up to the courts for direction on how the industry should be regulated in the wake of the SEC’s continued clampdown on several stakeholders in the industry.

XRP Price Anticipates Quiet October: Expert Predicts Minimal Activity;"The post XRP Price Anticipates Quiet October: Expert Predicts Minimal Activity appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
XRP holds steady at $0.490994, demonstrating resilience in the face of recent fluctuations. Despite minor weekly and fortnightly declines, it boasts a 44% year-to-date increase. Ripple’s legal victory against the SEC in July has greatly contributed to its positive trajectory. Furthermore, XRP received a temporary boost from recent rumors about a Bitcoin ETF approval. This stability sets the stage for a potential rally when market conditions turn bullish, making XRP an intriguing asset to watch. But wait—it won’t happen soon. 
Despite Bitcoin’s recent boost to the digital asset market, XRP remains below the $0.5 mark. In response to bullish sentiments for a significant upheaval, prominent XRP figure Edward Farina, Head of Social Adoption for XRP Healthcare, advises caution. He predicts that October will bring no significant change for XRP, urging enthusiasts to avoid setting unrealistic expectations. Farina emphasizes the potential toll of excessive optimism on mental well-being. In a downturn when all the assets are facing fluctuations, Farina’s bearish XRP outlook seems realistic.  
Nothing will happen in October. Stop hoping for a moon for this month. Be realistic. Too much hope is not good for your health.The reality is that $XRP will ascend into the sky when you least expect it.
Farina acknowledges his belief that “Nothing will happen in October” in XRP’s eventual value appreciation but anticipates it happening unexpectedly. He advises the community to stay realistic, emphasizing that an excessive focus on positive outcomes may have adverse effects. Many in the XRP community support Farina’s perspective, suggesting that XRP’s success hinges on broader market conditions rather than technical analysis. 
Community members like John Watkins believe XRP’s fortunes will turn with increased market liquidity. They dismiss reliance on technical charts to predict XRP’s trajectory. Sanjay Kumar Tiwari echoes this sentiment, emphasizing that XRP’s future depends on global readiness to adopt the cryptocurrency. Tiwari stresses that no one can accurately predict this turning point.
The future of XRP is questionable. It may rise and benefit traders and investors if it stays over $0.473. However, a slide below this critical level might ignite selling and threaten XRP. Many also see this phase as a vital XRP accumulation phase with less SEC pressure. XRP can attract new investors with a discounted price. The following stages for XRP are crucial—the world is watching!

Bitcoin Price is About to See “Liftoff” if It’s Able to Hold One Crucial Level;"Bitcoin price is consolidating above the $28,000 support. BTC could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $28,550 resistance zone.
Bitcoin price retreated and trimmed gains from the $30,000 resistance zone. BTC traded below the $29,200 and $28,800 levels to move back into a short-term negative zone.
However, the bulls were active near the $28,000 zone. A low was formed near $28,100 and the price started a consolidation phase. There was a move above the $28,250 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $30,000 swing high to the $28,100 low.
Bitcoin price is now trading above $28,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $28,550 level. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance near $28,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.
The next key resistance could be near $29,000 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $30,000 swing high to the $28,100 low. A clear move above the $29,000 resistance zone could set the pace for a larger increase. The next key resistance could be $29,500.

Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com
If the bulls remain in action, the next stop above $29,500 could be $30,000. Any more gains might send BTC toward the $30,650 level.
If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $28,550 resistance zone, it could slide further. Immediate support on the downside is near the $28,350 level and the triangle region.
The next major support is near the $28,000 level. A downside break and close below the $28,000 support might send the price further lower. The next support sits at $27,600 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.
Technical indicators:
Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.
Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $28,350, followed by $28,000.
Major Resistance Levels – $28,550, $29,000, and $29,500.

Bitcoin Worth in Question as Economist Peter Schiff Declares It ‘Nothing’;"In a recent post on X, Peter Schiff, a renowned crypto critic and economist, made a provocative statement regarding Bitcoin, asserting that it is not a resource and essentially amounts to nothing. Schiff made the remark following a statement from Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital and an early investor in Bitcoin.
Specifically, the crypto critic mentioned that Novogratz has expressed a view he agrees with about Bitcoin. According to Schiff, Novogratz stated that Bitcoin is not something people inherently need but rather something that is sold to them through persuasion.
Schiff added, “No one needs Bitcoin. So, people only buy it after someone else talks them into doing so. Then once they buy, they immediately try to convince others to buy too.” Therefore, the crypto critic likened Bitcoin’s popularity to that of a cult.
Finally @novogratz got something right about #Bitcoin.  He admitted that it's not bought, but sold. No …

ETH Price Watch: Impact On Price As Traders Ditch Bitcoin On Derivatives Market;"Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been on a downward trajectory for the past three months. Despite a brief fake-out rally, ETH has struggled to regain its footing in the crypto market.
The recent rally, though short-lived, has brought about interesting developments in the derivatives market. While Bitcoin’s open interest (OI) witnessed a significant drop, Ethereum saw an increase in its OI.
Open interest, often abbreviated as OI, is a crucial metric in the world of cryptocurrency derivatives. It represents the total value of outstanding contracts in the market. In simpler terms, it measures the amount of money traders have invested in futures or options contracts for a specific cryptocurrency.
As of October, the crypto derivatives market has depicted an intriguing scenario. Bitcoin’s OI has been hovering around $6 billion, while Ethereum’s stands at $2.8 billion. Although ETH has not surpassed BTC in terms of open interest, it has certainly garnered more attention and interest.

A recent fake rally in Bitcoin’s price, triggered by false reports of an approved spot Bitcoin ETF, had a substantial impact on the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) declined by more than $270 million, decreasing to $5.7 billion as investors reacted to the misleading information.
On the other hand, Ethereum’s OI increased by over $93 million, reaching $2.8 billion during the same period, highlighting its resilience in the face of market volatility.
These events underscore the cryptocurrency market’s sensitivity to news and rumors, emphasizing the importance of accurate information in this space.
Furthermore, the contrasting trajectories of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s OI showcase Ethereum’s ability to attract renewed investor interest and maintain stability, solidifying its position as a prominent and enduring cryptocurrency in the market.

At the time of writing, the CoinGecko price for Ethereum is $1,548. It’s noteworthy that ETH has experienced a 1.9% dip in the past 24 hours and a 0.6% loss over the past week.
Analyzing the daily price chart, Ethereum’s price action is characterized by a rising wedge formation. This formation serves as a key determinant of ETH’s short-term trajectory.
As long as the trendlines defining this pattern remain intact, there’s potential for the coin to serve as a dynamic support zone for buyers during market corrections.
However, a more pessimistic scenario looms in the event of a breakdown below the lower boundary of this wedge, which could signal the onset of a major correction for Ethereum.

SEC Chair Gensler Remains Tight-Lipped About Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals;"After a year’s worth of stonewalling spot Bitcoin ETF applicants, the SEC may be taking a more laid-back approach toward their proponents.
Following a failed bid to block Grayscale from creating an ETF via lawsuit, Cathie Wood – the CEO of Ark Invest – stated that she had noticed a welcome change in the SEC’s behavior. Instead of outright refusing to consider applications, the regulator began asking questions about the proposed ETF, which she views as a positive sign.
“The fact that the SEC chose to ask questions is a change in behavior. Therefore, I do think hopes are rising that a – or a number of – Bitcoin ETFs will be approved.”
Mike Novogratz confirmed that the SEC asked similar questions about Galaxy Digital’s own proposed ETF. According to him, spot Bitcoin ETFs should be approved by the end of the year.
However, SEC chairman Gary Gensler remained tight-lipped when interviewed on the subject by Bloomberg Reporters.
In an interview with Bloomberg reporter Kailey Lenz – who also took the time to wish Gensler a Happy Birthday – the SEC chair stated that he and his team are currently reviewing eight to ten spot Bitcoin ETF applicants.
Here’s a short clip of @kaileyleinz asking Gensler about $GBTC and other spot #Bitcoin ETFs. Mostly non-answers in my opinion but does talk about the disclosure review team. We’ve had some insight into their process via the amendments from some of these filers in recent days pic.twitter.com/lIWZc74OAi
— James Seyffart (@JSeyff) October 18, 2023

According to Gensler, the applications are currently with the Corporate Finance Division, following the same process as many other investment funds over the decades.
“So it’s really the work of our Division of Corporation Finance that gives feedback, our Division of Trading and Markets, of course, looks at the filings. This is a time-tested process that goes back decades. The staff of the SEC, it’s called the Disclosure Review Team, but in that group, they respond and give feedback to potential issuers.”
When asked about the likelihood of the ETFs being approved, Gensler responded that he cannot comment on ongoing cases – and that he, personally, will not pre-judge the outcome of the process.
The short interview is largely in line with the most recent developments in the regulator’s attitude towards spot Bitcoin ETFs. After losing its court case against Grayscale last month, the SEC decided against appealing.
However, an approval of Grayscale’s fund has not been provided yet. If the above interview is any indication, it’s likely that multiple ETFs will be greenlighted or denied simultaneously within the coming months.

Shiba Inu Burn Rate Takes A Steep Dive: 91% Decrease In 24 Hours;"Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently experienced a dramatic decline in its burn rate. This plunge, amounting to a staggering 90.57%, comes at a time when the SHIB token is facing a sharp drop in its market price. 
Typically, lower token prices present more extensive opportunities for token burning as it becomes more affordable to acquire additional SHIB tokens for the purpose of destroying them. However, it appears that the prevailing negative sentiment in the market is dampening the burn attempts.
At the time of writing, the SHIB token is trading at $0.00000692 according to CoinGecko, marking a 1.9% decline over the past 24 hours. On a more optimistic note, the token has seen a 1.2% increase in the past seven days. It’s evident that SHIB is experiencing some turbulence in its value.

Yet, Shiba Inu’s burning program is making waves by bucking the trend. In a surprising turn of events, the token’s burn rate surged by over 200%, leading to the elimination of 53 million SHIB tokens and a reduction in its overall supply. This ambitious initiative is part of a strategic effort to make SHIB scarcer and, hopefully, more valuable over time. 
The successful execution of Shiba Inu’s burning program has been cited as one of the potential catalysts for a future increase in SHIB token value. The reduction in token supply can create a sense of scarcity, which often drives demand among investors. 
Additionally, Shiba Inu’s innovative layer-2 blockchain solution, known as Shibarium, is another factor that could fuel a rally in SHIB’s price.
Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution, was unveiled to the crypto world at the end of August, and it has since made significant strides. The network has achieved several remarkable milestones in the months following its launch.
Shibarium’s potential impact on the future of Shiba Inu cannot be underestimated, as it opens up new horizons for this meme-inspired cryptocurrency.

As Shiba Inu embarks on its journey to foster innovation and adapt to the evolving crypto landscape, the development of Shibarium stands out as a beacon of hope. The network’s rapid progress and achievements are a testament to the dedication and creativity of the Shiba Inu development team.
If Shibarium continues to hit milestones and gain traction, it could become a driving force behind the resurgence of SHIB’s value, ultimately defying the bearish market sentiment that currently looms over the crypto world.
These factors could potentially set the stage for a remarkable revival in SHIB’s value, illustrating the resilience and determination of the Shiba Inu ecosystem in the face of market challenges.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently experienced a dramatic decline in its burn rate. This plunge, amounting to a staggering 90.57%, comes at a time when the SHIB token is facing a sharp drop in its market price. 
Typically, lower token prices present more extensive opportunities for token burning as it becomes more affordable to acquire additional SHIB tokens for the purpose of destroying them. However, it appears that the prevailing negative sentiment in the market is dampening the burn attempts.
At the time of writing, the SHIB token is trading at $0.00000692 according to CoinGecko, marking a 1.9% decline over the past 24 hours. On a more optimistic note, the token has seen a 1.2% increase in the past seven days. It’s evident that SHIB is experiencing some turbulence in its value.

Yet, Shiba Inu’s burning program is making waves by bucking the trend. In a surprising turn of events, the token’s burn rate surged by over 200%, leading to the elimination of 53 million SHIB tokens and a reduction in its overall supply. This ambitious initiative is part of a strategic effort to make SHIB scarcer and, hopefully, more valuable over time. 
The successful execution of Shiba Inu’s burning program has been cited as one of the potential catalysts for a future increase in SHIB token value. The reduction in token supply can create a sense of scarcity, which often drives demand among investors. 
Additionally, Shiba Inu’s innovative layer-2 blockchain solution, known as Shibarium, is another factor that could fuel a rally in SHIB’s price.
Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution, was unveiled to the crypto world at the end of August, and it has since made significant strides. The network has achieved several remarkable milestones in the months following its launch.
Shibarium’s potential impact on the future of Shiba Inu cannot be underestimated, as it opens up new horizons for this meme-inspired cryptocurrency.

As Shiba Inu embarks on its journey to foster innovation and adapt to the evolving crypto landscape, the development of Shibarium stands out as a beacon of hope. The network’s rapid progress and achievements are a testament to the dedication and creativity of the Shiba Inu development team.
If Shibarium continues to hit milestones and gain traction, it could become a driving force behind the resurgence of SHIB’s value, ultimately defying the bearish market sentiment that currently looms over the crypto world.
These factors could potentially set the stage for a remarkable revival in SHIB’s value, illustrating the resilience and determination of the Shiba Inu ecosystem in the face of market challenges.

Here Are the Major Tailwinds for Ethereum Rival Solana, According to Crypto Analyst;"A widely followed crypto analyst is naming a number of potential bullish catalysts for Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL).
In a new video, the anonymous host of InvestAnswers tells his 447,000 YouTube subscribers that Solana is receiving more mainstream attention amid key program developments.
“I see a number of different tailwinds for Solana. It is still riskier than ETH. ETH is the 800-pound gorilla. Nearly everything runs on Ethereum. And it’s very hard to knock that rider off the horse. But let me talk to you about some of the tailwinds…
The world is waking up to it now, all the narratives, [the] mainstream media. You got Fidelity talking about ETH and SOL alongside each other. You have that other report coming out from Standard Chartered Bank. They said ETH is going to $8,000 and they also referenced Solana in their research paper that Solana could eat a lot of ETH market share, especially around things like tokenization, which was huge.” 
The analyst lists a number of tailwinds for Solana, including Solana Pay, which recently integrated with Shopify, and the project’s crypto-friendly smartphone Saga.
“But the tailwinds are Solana Pay, Saga phone, the decentralized app store. They’ve got EVMs (Ethereum virtual machine) and SVMs (Solana virtual machine) built on Solana so now SOL-to-ETH bridging is very capable. 
Firedancer and one million transactions per second, that’s coming. They hope to come out of beta at the end of this year and launch sometime in 2024. But that will bring resilience, efficiency, decentralization and security. This whole thing is built on C++, whereas Ethereum is built on Rust… And if they have both up and running, there is no risk of ever any downtime again. 
Also, cost-efficiency and scalability, the Visa partnership, great tokenomics, gaming, tokenization of the world.” 
Solana is trading for $24.18 at time of writing, up 9.27% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin SV Climbs 22% – A Close Look At The Factors Behind The Surge;"Despite seeing a notable increase of 15.2% in value yesterday, the current price of Bitcoin SV remains steady at a little over $39 compared to the previous day.
The current market situation involves a struggle with the immediate dynamic resistance level, leading to a state of uneasiness among traders.
Bitcoin SV, a Bitcoin fork, is now the most profitable cryptocurrency out of the top 100 by market capitalization.
The value of the world’s cryptocurrency market increased to $1.09 trillion at the time of writing, a 1.4% gain in a day. On Tuesday, ETH increased by about 0.1% to $1,585, while BTC was up 2.6% at $28,466.60.
The recent rally in cryptocurrency prices was primarily driven by optimism about the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) potentially approving a Bitcoin ETF. This sentiment was strengthened when the SEC chose not to appeal the Grayscale lawsuit.
However, there was a spike in BSV prices due to a false report from CoinTelegraph claiming that the SEC was anticipating the iShares Bitcoin Trust, pushing Bitcoin to nearly $30,000 before it quickly dropped.
At the time of writing, BSV occupies the No. 48 spot and was trading at $39.40, up 22% in the last seven days, data form crypto market tracker Coingecko shows.
The RSI for BSV is 67.58, the same as it was yesterday. This RSI level is slowly approaching overbought zone, which could indicate that a little correction or consolidation in the price of BSV is imminent.

Bitcoin SV is displaying positive indicators in terms of trading volume and market capitalization. Its market cap has risen by 1.22% to reach $757 million, and its 24-hour trading volume has surged by a significant 83% to $238 million.
This increased trading activity suggests growing trader interest and the potential for BSV’s price to continue moving upward.
When market confidence persisted, the price of Bitcoin Cash also surged. The robust performance of American stocks served as an example of the increase. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones both experienced gains of more than 1%, but the Nasdaq 100 index saw a leap of more than 1.10%. Cryptocurrencies have historically performed well on rising stock prices.
Meanwhile, the current price of BSV is encountering a horizontal resistance zone ranging from $38.5 to $40.6. This resistance zone is also in alignment with the Fibonacci 0.5 level, at $39.75.
The possibility of a successful breach of this resistance level may indicate a sustained higher trajectory for Bitcoin SV.
Concurrently, there exists a proximate support region ranging from $33.85 to $36.10, which aligns with the Fibonacci 0.618 level of $35.89 and the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $34.79.
In the event that the BSV price is unable to maintain its position above the designated support zone, there is a possibility of an impending negative trend.

Bitcoin (BTC) Could Crash 50% From 2023 High Before Next Year’s Halving, Says Analyst Benjamin Cowen;"Widely followed crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that Bitcoin (BTC) could see a significant price drop before next year’s halving event in April 2024.
In a new interview with Scott Melker, Cowen says Bitcoin has historically collapsed by 50% in the lead-up to a halving event.
Whlie the analyst doesn’t specifically predict such a collapse, a 50% drop from Bitcoin’s last high would place it near $15,000.
“Look, last cycle, what we always see, everyone talks about the Bitcoin halving. I’ve seen this for the last several cycles. Everyone talks about it and what normally happens is Bitcoin halves [in price] before the halving and then people are like, ‘Oh, well, that’s what the halving meant.’ 
Last cycle, the drop into the pandemic, we still dropped 50% even before that occurred. That was still a 50% drop. And this drop started in the summer. Go to the cycle before that. We had a drop starting in the summer and it dropped 50% before the real bull market began. So I still look at it and some people say, ‘Well, it’s not dropping today.’ How do we know it’s not? How do we know that this isn’t just a lower high and that this is still part of the 50% drop? It could be.”
Cowen says one of the reasons why he believes Bitcoin could make a major move to the downside is the drying up of liquidity in crypto and most risk asset markets.
“And that’s my concern for Bitcoin, is that liquidity is leaving the altcoin market. The purchasing power of these altcoins are going down and at some point, I think that affects Bitcoin. Look at the total market cap. If there were a lot of new money coming into the space, why is the total market cap the same as it was back in February and the same as it was back in August 2022? 
There’s not really a lot of new money coming into the space it’s basically just money shuffling around from the altcoin market to Bitcoin and one of the main drivers of it is Ethereum. Look at look at what’s going on with the ETH/Bitcoin pair. It’s collapsing right now. I said before, this just simply looks like a distribution phase.”
Bitcoin is trading for $28,527 at time of writing, while the ETH/BTC pair is trading for 0.05532 BTC ($1,578).

Bitcoin Breakout Confirmed: Here’s When the BTC Price May Reach $50,000;"The post Bitcoin Breakout Confirmed: Here’s When the BTC Price May Reach $50,000 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The recent upswing has raised the Bitcoin price slightly above the bearish influence as it crossed one of the important barriers. With this, the optimism around the token and the entire crypto market appears to have grown to some extent. As the price reached beyond $29,000 for the first time since mid-August, traders placed massive short bets. Hence, it is believed to be one of the biggest bullish indicators as the short positions fill up.
The BTC price in the past few days has been displaying huge bullish momentum, as it has been maintaining an ascending trend since the September lows. Although the volume has been consistent ever since the price faced its first plunge of the year in March 2023, the price has now risen beyond the pivotal technical levels. Hence, a bullish close for the week above these levels may trigger a notable upswing soon!
The BTC price has surged above the pivotal 200-day MA levels in the long term after acting as resistance since August lows. The rise in the past few days has elevated beyond these levels, suggesting the last quarter of the year could be bullish until the BTC price trades above. Besides, the DMI continues to remain bearish in the long term, indicating the probability of a fresh descending trend.
However, in the short term, the Bitcoin price appears to be fighting crucial levels, as a retest of around $27,700 could still be possible amid a strong ascending trend. Once the BTC price soars and sustains above $28,800, the bulls could further raise it to close to $30,000 in just a matter of time. On the other hand, historically, the token appears to be at the foothills of a massive explosion.
The price broke out from the descending trend after forming a constant lower low and high and hence if a similar price action repeats, Bitcoin price could trigger a fine bull run in the coming days.

SHIB Whales Make a Splash, 400% Surge in Token Activity;"The post SHIB Whales Make a Splash, 400% Surge in Token Activity appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Large SHIB token transactions have increased by an incredible 400% recently, experiencing a staggering 4x surge in token outflows within just 24 hours. This extraordinary action has sparked discussions about the possibility that the crypto “whales” are awakening and becoming more noticeable in the market.
According to recent data from IntoTheBlock, the transfer of SHIB tokens from the wallets of major holders surged from 53.81 billion to 208.28 billion SHIB in a single Saturday, with little impact on the token’s price.
The same data showed that daily inflows into these whale wallets fell significantly, dropping from 4.66 trillion tokens to a mere 271.32 billion within the same timeframe. This sharp contrast between outflows and inflows has led experts to speculate about the reasons behind these surprising changes.
Meanwhile, one of the possible reasons for this sudden decrease could be the recent baseless speculation concerning Bitcoin’s acceptance as a spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). This incorrect rumour about Bitcoin had a ripple effect, impacting other altcoins just as it did with SHIB’s price.
The true owners of Shiba Inu tokens are primarily large centralized exchanges, holding approximately 623 trillion SHIB, including the burn address. The stability of SHIB’s price despite substantial outflows suggests coordinated actions by these centralized entities.
Meanwhile, their increased participation may have various motivations, including pursuing substantial profits, adjusting their investment portfolios, or taking positions in specific markets. Given their capacity to influence supply and demand dynamics, their entry or exit can significantly impact market sentiment.
However, the fact that SHIB’s price remained relatively steady despite these substantial outflows raises questions about the potential influence of these large holders on the market. 
The concern here is that the actions of these whales could potentially introduce uncertainty into the future of the Shiba Inu market.

Crypto Regulation: Is the SEC Acting for Investors or Wall Street?;"Forbes contributor and long-time crypto advocate Sam Lyman, in a recent interview, accused the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of not protecting retail investors’ interests in its regulation of crypto entities.
Lyman asserted that the SEC, under Gary Gensler, has been advancing Wall Street and political interests. “The revolving door between DC and Wall Street spins so fast, it could generate its own electricity,” he said, alluding to their closeness.
He continued that Gensler’s actions aren’t surprising, considering he made “millions on Wall Street” before foraying into politics. Lyman said:
The leadership at SEC, people like Gary Gensler, who do they rub shoulders with every day? Is it the grandma who just bought her bitcoin, is it the teenager who just downloaded Coinbase for the first time, or is it their buddies back in Wall Street?

The leadership at SEC, people like Gary Gensler, who do they rub shoulders with every day? Is it the grandma who just bought her bitcoin, is it the teenager who just downloaded Coinbase for the first time, or is it their buddies back in Wall Street?
According to the advoc…

Uniswap Is Decentralizing: Why Are DeFi Users Worried About This Feature?;"Devin Walsh, Executive Director of the Uniswap Foundation, a non-profit organization supporting the growth and decentralization of the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX), believes that Uniswap is decentralizing. Walsh even compares the current state of the DEX to that of Ethereum. The executive also acknowledged that the DEX’s current level of success is due to the active participation and contribution of the developer community.
The Executive Director responded to a thread on X where Antonio Juliano, the founder of dYxX, a layer-2 DEX on Ethereum, insinuated that Uniswap is now centralized. However, it started on a decentralized path. 
With centralization, Juliano added, the protocol can iterate quickly, mainly to boost revenue. On the other hand, by being more decentralized, dapps allow users to enjoy the full advantages of decentralized finance (DeFi).
Decentralization of protocols launching on public ledgers, like Ethereum or Cardano, is crucial. Usually, the community will gauge how well a dapp is decentralized by looking at, among other factors, how decisions are made and which party spearheads development. 
In the case of Ethereum, Walsh pointed out that the community has taken over from where Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder; and Consensys, a technology company developing solutions for Ethereum, left. Since then, multiple developers have been refining the network and ensuring it is secure and robust to anchor dapps. 
Uniswap is one of the most popular DEXes on Ethereum, looking at total value locked (TVL). DeFiLlama data shows that the exchange manages over $3 billion of assets and is primarily active on Ethereum. However, the exchange enables trustless swapping on layer-2 platforms like OP Mainnet, and public ledgers like the BNB Chain.
Presently, Uniswap Labs leads the development of Uniswap. Nonetheless, Walsh said more developers are now building and contributing solutions. This, the Uniswap Foundation executive further observed, is especially considering the scheduled launch of Hooks in v4. 
There is no specific timeline for when Uniswap will deploy the latest iteration, but the release of the Cancun upgrade on Ethereum will play a role. The protocol will be more customizable with Hooks since the feature acts more like a plugin. 
Even so, there have been concerns that Hooks, though being developed by community developers, will be the basis for Uniswap to censor liquidity providers (LP) or traders who don’t verify by adhering to know-your-customer rules (KYC). UNI prices remain under pressure at spot rates and may break lower, registering new 2023 lows.

Resilient Bitcoin defies interest rate pressures and technical resistance;"In a striking reversal from the start of the week, CryptoSlate reports a resurgence of Bitcoin, which was grappling beneath key technical levels but has since ascended above them.
This recovery is significant, given the substantial resistance observed near $28,000, a level influenced by the 200-week, 200-day, and 111-day moving averages and the short-term holder’s realized price.
The rebound is even more noteworthy considering the imminent 5% benchmark of the US10Y, a critical yield that sets the global interest rate benchmark. This key indicator is gearing up to hit levels unseen since before the 2007 financial crisis, entailing a tightening economic environment and adding pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin.
Amplifying these developments is the US02Y yield, which has cleared the 2006 peak at 5.253% and recorded its highest level since 2000.

Bitcoin accumulation hits highest level since July, signaling bullish trend;"The Accumulation Trend Score, a metric indicating the relative size of entities actively accumulating Bitcoin, has signaled a shift. This indicator evaluates on-chain Bitcoin holdings, factoring in the size of an entity’s balance (participation score) and their recent acquisition or selling activity (balance change score).
On this scale, a score approaching 1 suggests extensive accumulation by larger entities, while a score nearing 0 indicates distribution or a lack of accumulation.
For the first time since July, the Accumulation Trend Score reached above the 0.5 mark on Oct. 17 while registering at 0.64 yesterday, Oct. 18. This upturn implies that significant cohorts are amassing Bitcoin, showing a trend towards accumulation on a network-wide scale.
The data reveals more profound patterns when broken down by cohort size. “Shrimps,” or those holding less than 1 Bitcoin, have consistently accumulated throughout October. Larger cohorts, namely those holding between 1-10, 10-100, and 1,000-10,000 Bitcoin, have shown a marked trend towards accumulation beginning this week. This surge in accumulation across various cohorts signals a broadening trend of Bitcoin acquisition.

Top Trader Says One Compelling Bullish Argument for Bitcoin (BTC) Now in Play – Here’s What He Means;"A popular analyst says that after an abrupt move to the upside, Bitcoin (BTC) could remain in an uptrend.
Pseudonymous analyst Cred tells his 53,500 subscribers of the TechnicalRoundup YouTube channel that if Bitcoin holds above a key level, it could indicate continued bullish momentum for the king crypto.
BTC soared to as high as $30,000 Monday after a news site falsely claimed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a spot market Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Says the analyst,
“If this is a daily breakout, obviously it’s messy where it’s ended up, because it’s a very fast move and into this prior area, the pre-breakdown range at $29,000, and we actually tapped $30,000… But structurally speaking, fake news or not, retrace or not, as long as the market can hold on a daily closing basis $28,000, then even if this wick weren’t there, then that would still be a compelling bullish argument. 
I think that’s a really good way to think about and process this type of price action. If I take my levels, I take my high timeframe closes, if this wick weren’t there, what would my analysis be? And I think there is some merit to that, which is why I’m still focusing on levels and high timeframe candle closes because they can certainly filter for a lot of the noise that surrounds these types of market events. So bull-bear line on the weekly and the daily is $28,000.”
The trader says that if Bitcoin loses the key $28,000 level it will likely retrace to the $26,000 range.
“Obviously… the peak bearish scenario is that this was just a mega top and shouldn’t have happened at all. And we’re just going to proceed to, just like on some of these other moves that we had, essentially get a big outsized move, it goes nowhere and then bleeds down and retraces.”
Bitcoin is trading for $28,496 at time of writing.

Blackrock CEO says crypto rally was a flight into quality;"Larry Fink, CEO of the massive asset management company Blackrock, said that yesterday’s surge in Bitcoin and crypto was a flight into quality.
Following Monday’s huge spike in the bitcoin price, after CoinTelegraph had mistakenly tweeted that the IShares Spot Bitcoin ETF was a done deal, Larry Fink was a guest of Fox News, and what he had to say about crypto would surprise many, even after lauding Bitcoin in recent times.
When questioned about the event on Fox Business News yesterday, Larry Fink said he had been busy all day and had only heard of the news about an hour previously. However, he went on to say:
“This is an example of the pent-up interest in crypto, and we are hearing from clients around the world about the need for crypto. 
He added:
“I think some of this rally is way beyond the rumour. I think the rally today is about a flight into quality.”
Fink defined his flight into quality as investors buying into treasuries, gold, or crypto. 
When asked where the markets might go if a hot war broke out over the next several days, Fink expressed his view that as long as the war stayed within the borders of the countries concerned it was probably priced in. But he also thought that much depended on the oil market.
For Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, one of the largest companies in the world, with $9.4 trillion under management, to speak about crypto using this kind of language is the most positive recommendation for the asset that it’s possible to get.
However, how this balances with the various vitriolic statements on crypto from the Biden administration, the US regulators, the European Central Bank, and most of the global (unelected) financial agencies is yet to be seen.
Those holding crypto still need to be cautious about Fink’s bullish optimism on crypto. He also apologised for the term “ESG”, saying that it had been “weaponised” by those on the left and the right, but he and his company are still part of the “system”, and links with governments and central banks are bound to still be there. Crypto came into being as “the people’s money”. Be that as it may, with Blackrock and other huge institutional entities entering the arena, the bulk of the ownership might well be transferred elsewhere.

Hot or Not? The Ultimate Price Prediction for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA);"Bitcoin’s hash rate skyrocketed, achieving a monumental increase in its computational power, as depicted by the surge from 261 EH/s to a whopping 455 EH/s within just a year. Not just that, luxury brands like Ferrari have stepped into the crypto space, allowing crypto enthusiasts to purchase their dream cars with digital currencies. Though crypto’s inherent volatility has deterred many traditional companies from embracing it, its foothold in the market is undeniable.
The Bitcoin ecosystem has been buzzing with exciting news. The US SEC is rumored to have approved a spot Bitcoin ETF, stirring a rapid price surge for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Edward Snowden’s recent statements during the 2023 Bitcoin Conference in Amsterdam emphasize Bitcoin's significance in the contemporary world – presenting it as a beacon against governmental oversight and fiat currency devaluation.
Despite the uncertainty surrounding the ETF news, BTC’s price displayed a rapid increase. Its significance in the realm of privacy and its continual fight against government and institutional opposition has made it the talk of the town. However, a slight hiccup occurred when rumors regarding the Bitcoin ETF's approval were refuted by outlets like BlackRock.
Bitcoin is currently trading above $28K. It stands above its 10-day Moving Average but slightly above its 200-day Moving Average, suggesting bullish momentum.
Given the current traction and if it sustains above the resistance of $29,029.85, BTC might aim for the $31,600.32 mark. On the downside, if Bitcoin breaks below its support level of $23,888.91, it might further slump to $21,318.44.
Ethereum is gearing up for some transformative changes. Its founder, Vitalik Buterin, has proposed a novel two-tiered staking mechanism that could redefine Ethereum’s very essence, promoting efficiency and decentralization.
Ethereum's staking yield has witnessed a decline, dropping to 3.5% from over 5% in the past few months. However, the Ethereum validator queue's emptying signals a potential slowdown in mainnet activity, at least for the foreseeable future.
At the time of writing, Ethereum is currently trading around $1,500K. It is situated below both its 10-day Moving Average of 1576.67 and its 200-day Moving Average of 1793.04, indicating potential bearish pressure in the short term.
If Ethereum manages to surpass its first resistance level at $1,794.08, it could then target the next resistance at $1,955.98. On the contrary, should Ethereum dip below its primary support of $1,470.28, the next potential support is at $1,308.38.
Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, recently addressed long-standing conspiracy theories linked with the XRP community and Ethereum's supposed sway over the SEC. While he dismissed the allegations, he emphasized the significance of relying on factual evidence over conjectures.
Cardano (ADA) is currently trading between $0.2409 and $0.2630. It's situated just above its 10-day Moving Average at $0.2499, hinting at a mild bullish momentum in the short-term. However, it's trading significantly below its 200-day Moving Average at $0.3135, which signals an overall bearish trend in the longer-term perspective.
If ADA manages to push beyond its first resistance level at $0.2721, there's potential for it to reach the next resistance at $0.2942. This would be more plausible if there are significant positive news or developments in the Cardano ecosystem. Bearish Scenario: On the other hand, should ADA fall below its immediate support of $0.2279, it might aim for the second support level at $0.2058. A break below this level, especially coupled with adverse market news, could be a cause for concern among ADA holders.
The crypto space continues to be an environment of high volatility and unpredictability. Each of the cryptocurrencies, be it Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Cardano, carries its own set of narratives and market dynamics. Staying updated, well-researched, and cautious in your approach to investing or trading in this space is crucial. Always use accurate data, understand the inherent risks, and if possible, seek professional advice when making decisions.

If ADA manages to push beyond its first resistance level at $0.2721, there's potential for it to reach the next resistance at $0.2942. This would be more plausible if there are significant positive news or developments in the Cardano ecosystem. Bearish Scenario: On the other hand, should ADA fall below its immediate support of $0.2279, it might aim for the second support level at $0.2058. A break below this level, especially coupled with adverse market news, could be a cause for concern among ADA holders.

SOL Price Analysis: Solana Jumps to $25, Will The Rally Continue? ;"The post SOL Price Analysis: Solana Jumps to $25, Will The Rally Continue?  appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Rising with the rumors of Blackrock ETF being accepted, the SOL price sustains the growth after Blackrock clears the smoke. With the petition from Blackrock under review, Solana’s market value rides with the high sentiment rally in the market. 
As the altcoins gain momentum with the recovery in Bitcoin, a new altcoin season seems just around the corner. Further, the overnight growth supports the Solana price prediction, anticipating a bullish journey above $30 in the next altseason. 
Following the channel breakout, the $25 resistance zone becomes a crucial overhead barrier for the SOL price rally. Facing rejection with long wicks formations, the huge supply present at the $25 mark keeps the breakout rally under check. 
With the precious rejection leading to a drop to the 200-day EMA, the buyers reclaim momentum to challenge the zone. With a reversal from the 50-day EMA followed by the overnight growth of 9.25%, Solana reached the $25 mark.
However, the bears remain intact and hold their positions as the bullish engulfing candle shows a small wick formation. This delays the breakout and reflects the strong position of sellers. Nonetheless, the SOL price trades at $24.19 with an intraday jump of 0.96% reflecting stamina left in the bulls. 
Technical Indicators:
EMA: The bounce back from the 50-day EMA and the sudden jump increases the possibility of a golden crossover. 
MACD indicator: The MACD indicator shows the MACD and signal lines ready for a bullish crossover as the negative histograms decline. This reflects the momentum indicator under bullish influence and signals a buying opportunity. 
Considering the buyers maintain momentum with the market-wide recovery, the altcoins will skyrocket this Uptober season. If the SOL price rises above the $25 resistance zone, then the buyers can drive the market value above $30.
However, if the trend reverses from $25, a retest of the $22 mark is highly likely.

False ETF Approval News Pumps BTC to 30k, What Could Happen When True?;"After long weeks of passive trading, Bitcoin saw a sudden spike in the last 24 hours. Specifically, Bitcoin nearly broke the $30k price point in the past few hours before facing resistance around the $29k region. Yet, BTC trades at $28,062.51, a significant uptick from its cumulative seven-day performance. 
Notably, what caused the sudden spike in Bitcoin’s price was reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the first Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) for BlackRock, a global investment firm managing trillion-dollar worth of assets.
The crypto community has long awaited the U.S. regulator’s approval for the Bitcoin spot amid multiple rounds of delay. However, investigations later revealed that the reports claiming the SEC approved the first BTC ETF were false stories.

Gensler takes questions on spot Bitcoin ETFs, but keeps cards close to chest;"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler spoke to Bloomberg about several pending spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs on Oct. 18.
In his interview, Gensler acknowledged that around ten Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals are currently awaiting a decision from SEC staff.
He noted that he personally cannot pre-judge those proposals and declined to comment on widespread suggestions that the SEC might approve multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs at once. However, he confirmed that the SEC is currently doing work on “multiple filings” and said that various divisions are providing feedback to issuers.
When asked whether discussions between ETF issuers and the SEC have been productive, Gensler declined to provide any details on those conversations. He merely called the established approach a “time-tested process” that has been in place for decades.
Gensler also touched upon recent developments concerning Grayscale’s effort to convert its GBTC fund into a Bitcoin spot ETF before he commented on ETFs in general. Grayscale won the right to have its application reviewed by the SEC in court in August.
The SEC was allowed to appeal that court decision no later than Oct. 13, but the agency apparently declined to do so as no filings materialized. Gensler confirmed this in the interview, saying: “We didn’t appeal last Friday … I think that’s accurate.” He declined to state whether Grayscale’s legislation is still ongoing and did not comment on the matter further.
Even if the SEC is compelled to review Grayscale’s application, the agency will not be required to approve the proposed fund. Furthermore, any decision that applies to Grayscale’s proposal will not necessarily apply to other spot Bitcoin ETF proposals.
Gensler’s comments come two days after an inaccurate report suggesting that the SEC had approved BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF proposal gathered attention on social media. Though the rumor proved inaccurate, the price of Bitcoin surged above $30,000 as the misinformation spread before crashing back to previous levels.

From Dream to Reality:$2.7M Bitcoin Casino Win and Tax Aspects;"The post From Dream to Reality:$2.7M Bitcoin Casino Win and Tax Aspects appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Are you ready to be the next big winner in the world of online crypto gambling? Imagine hitting the jackpot and cashing in a whopping $2.7 million at a Bitcoin casino. It’s not just a dream – it’s a reality for some lucky players. However, as the old saying goes, “With a great win comes great responsibility.”
The legal framework regulating cryptocurrency gambling taxes varies considerably between countries and jurisdictions. That is why it is worth getting the advice of a tax specialist with experience in cryptocurrencies and gambling.
This article will guide you through the tax aspects of Bitcoin casino wins and how to navigate them reasonably.
Fairspin stands as a premier online gaming platform, boasting an extensive selection of over 7,000 top-tier games to cater to diverse player preferences. On this platform, players have consistently made headlines with their impressive victories.
Recently, one lucky player at Fairspin got a crazy win, enjoying the Gates of Olympus by Pragmatic Play. At the point of winning, the total monetary prize reached more than $2.7M. This remarkable victory came true in April, standing as a testament to the incredible potential of crypto casino entertainment.
So what does this mean for our fortunate winner in terms of taxes?
The taxation of gambling wins is a subject often shrouded in myths and misconceptions. It’s important to understand that gambling winnings’ tax laws vary from country to country.
In many cases, you may only be subject to taxes on your gambling winnings if it’s your primary source of income or profession. Yet, the rules can be a bit more complex regarding cryptocurrency gambling.
In some countries, such as the United States, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are considered digital assets rather than currency. Gambling winnings are subject to taxation in countries like China, India, Spain, and Mexico, regardless of whether it’s your primary income source.
Most other countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, and the United Kingdom, don’t tax gambling winnings, provided it’s not your primary source of income. But in this case, it’s vital to know that taxation may become applicable when you opt to convert, sell off, or cash out your cryptocurrency winnings.
Additionally, consider that tax laws can change rapidly, so staying informed and consulting a tax expert for personalized advice is essential. Every case is unique and requires more investigation to make the most of your win.
It is essential to keep accurate records of your cryptocurrency winnings as well as other financial transactions to maintain precise tax records. These details include the transaction date and time, the cryptocurrency’s value at the time of the transaction, and any associated fees.
Your gambling records will be invaluable when it’s time to calculate your tax liability, as the crypto market is highly volatile, and the value of Bitcoin can change incredibly fast. For example, the price of a cryptocurrency can rise or fall by more than 10% in a single day.
Online crypto gambling is a goldmine for those chasing big wins. The champion’s $2.7M victory in the Gates of Olympus showcases the immense potential of crypto casino entertainment.
Nevertheless, navigating the tax implications of your Bitcoin casino wins can be frustrating. The landscape of cryptocurrency regulations is ever-changing, and most countries’ approaches to handling and classifying gambling wins significantly differ.
Seeking guidance from tax professionals and referring to official government sources are essential steps to ensure accurate tax compliance and become increasingly important for smart crypto gambling.

Ethereum Fees Drop To Lowest Level Since 2020 As Enthusiasts Rub Their Hands In Glee;"
After years of sky-high gas fees, the Ethereum (ETH) network has completed a turnaround after recording its lowest transaction fees for the first time in over three years.
On Oct. 14, Ethereum’s average gas price stood at 7.941 Gwei, a figure that got the entire community beaming with pride. The last time Ethereum’s gas fees recorded a similar figure was back in April 2020, surging by over 100% alongside the rush of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi).
Exactly a year ago, the figure stood at 19.68 Gwei, leaving pundits with dwindling hopes for a reduction in transaction fees. Right off the bat, there are several contributory factors for the plummeting gas fees, including the decline of NFTs and the significant reduction in DeFi activities.
At the height of their powers, digital collectibles and DeFi yield farming made up a large chunk of transactions that clogged the Ethereum network, sending gas prices to astronomic levels. Speculative trading activity is another reason for the decline in gas fees, given the extended bear market and sideways trading of the asset class.
Another theory for the dwindling values of gas fees is the adoption of new layer 2 networks designed to improve Ethereum’s scalability. Pundits have described the rise of Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum as relieving a chunk of the pressure from the layer 2 network while mulling the possibilities of even lower gas fees.
According to on-chain analysts, the new trend may make ETH inflationary, bringing its claim of being ultrasound money under greater scrutiny.
“The low fee regime represents a major transition for Ethereum, trading off high revenues and deflationary supply for the promise to be able to attract mainstream users through layer 2s,” said Lucas Outumuro, IntoTheBlock’s head of research.
Despite a choppy start to life that saw ETH fall to $1,500 in October, bulls remain optimistic that the asset can ride the wave of low gas fees to recapture the $1,700 mark. Bulls are hinging their belief on a neutral stance to the bearish sentiment in the markets as they hope for stronger buying pressures at present levels.
In the last 2 hours, ETH has gained nearly 2% while trading volumes recorded a 5% jump over the last day. In other markets, Bitcoin (BTC) currently trades at $28K, with several altcoins riding the wave of the largest cryptocurrency to record small wins.

Digital Nomads and Bitcoin Casinos: Earning a Living from Anywhere in the World;"The post Digital Nomads and Bitcoin Casinos: Earning a Living from Anywhere in the World appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The concept of labor and making a living has undergone a fundamental upheaval in the age of digital innovation. Traditional 9-to-5 work is no longer the sole feasible option, and digital nomadism has opened up a world of alternatives for people seeking a different way of life. Coupled with the introduction of cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, a new frontier has developed, one in which individuals can earn a living anywhere globally, including from the virtual tables of Bitcoin casinos.
Digital nomadism, the lifestyle that allows people to work while travelling the world, has exploded in popularity in recent years. With the help of high-speed internet, collaborative tools, and a shift in perspective toward the traditional office, an increasing number of people can quickly learn more about the best Bitcoin casinos and digital nomadism. The lure is in the flexibility it provides: the freedom to select your working hours, the opportunity to experience new cultures, and the freedom from the restrictions of an actual office.
Geographic boundaries do not apply to digital nomads. They can wake up to the sunrise in Bali, eat lunch overlooking the Eiffel Tower, and conclude their day in California, all while satisfying their job duties. This way of life creates a sense of adventure and promotes personal and professional development by exposing you to new situations and viewpoints.
Bitcoin, the world’s first and most well-known cryptocurrency, lies at the heart of the digital nomad movement. It runs on a decentralized network, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries like banks. This financial flexibility appeals to digital nomads since it eliminates the burden of dealing with foreign currencies, expensive conversion fees, and international transaction delays.
Bitcoin also provides security and anonymity that traditional financial institutions do not. With cryptographic approaches safeguarding transactions, digital nomads can be confident in the security of their funds even when operating in unfamiliar or possibly unsafe areas. This protection is essential for those always on the road, ensuring their hard-earned money is always safe.
Another industry that has formed and quickly gained popularity in this era of digital nomadism and cryptocurrency is crypto casinos. These online gambling platforms only accept cryptocurrencies and allow players to play casino games with Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Several elements that resonate with the digital nomad lifestyle have contributed to the emergence of crypto casinos.
Privacy & Privacy: Bitcoin casinos provide players with a high level of privacy, allowing them to gamble without disclosing their identity. This feature is a massive benefit for digital nomads who value their privacy.
Global connectivity: A digital nomad can gamble in Bitcoin from anywhere worldwide if they have internet connectivity. This global accessibility is ideal for the itinerant lifestyle.
Fast and Low-Cost Transfers: Bitcoin is an excellent option for online gaming because of its quick transfers and low transaction costs. Bitcoin casinos do away with the fees and complicated banking procedures frequently associated with traditional casinos.
Innovative Games and Technology: To ensure fairness and transparency, Bitcoin casinos frequently integrate cutting-edge technology, such as blockchain, into their games. Additionally, they frequently provide particular games not seen in conventional casinos.
While making a living through online gambling may seem strange, it is a reality for some digital nomads. Competent players can use their knowledge of games like poker, blackjack, or sports betting to make a reliable living. The secret is to play strategically, comprehend the odds, and efficiently manage one’s bankroll.
Professional gamblers frequently consider their trade an investment, devoting time to learning the games, crafting winning tactics, and constantly honing their expertise. Some digital nomads have been able to live comfortably on the proceeds from crypto casinos by approaching gaming as a profession rather than a hobby.
However, it is critical to recognize the obstacles and hazards of relying on crypto casinos as a key source of revenue. Because gambling outcomes are unpredictable, financial stability is not guaranteed, and severe losses can occur. Whether digital nomads or not, individuals must gamble properly, set limits, and only bet what they can afford to lose.
Furthermore, the legal landscape around online gambling differs between countries and regions. Informing digital nomads of the legislation in the territories they visit is necessary to prevent legal complications related to online gambling. It is critical for any digital nomad involved in crypto casino activities to stay educated about the legality of online gambling activities and to follow local laws.
The convergence of digital nomadism and crypto casinos exemplifies the digital era’s continual transformation of work and pleasure. As technology advances and cryptocurrencies become more popular, the chances for making a living through unusual ways are expected to grow. With their adaptability and eagerness to adopt novel solutions, digital nomads are well-positioned to explore these areas further.
Furthermore, the connection between digital nomads and crypto casinos emphasizes the significance of financial education and digital literacy. Understanding the complexities of cryptocurrency, prudent financial management, and appropriate gambling habits are critical skills for those navigating this unique lifestyle.
Finally, the convergence of digital nomadism and crypto casinos indicates a paradigm shift in people’s perceptions of employment, pleasure, and financial transactions.

The post Digital Nomads and Bitcoin Casinos: Earning a Living from Anywhere in the World appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The concept of labor and making a living has undergone a fundamental upheaval in the age of digital innovation. Traditional 9-to-5 work is no longer the sole feasible option, and digital nomadism has opened up a world of alternatives for people seeking a different way of life. Coupled with the introduction of cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, a new frontier has developed, one in which individuals can earn a living anywhere globally, including from the virtual tables of Bitcoin casinos.
Digital nomadism, the lifestyle that allows people to work while travelling the world, has exploded in popularity in recent years. With the help of high-speed internet, collaborative tools, and a shift in perspective toward the traditional office, an increasing number of people can quickly learn more about the best Bitcoin casinos and digital nomadism. The lure is in the flexibility it provides: the freedom to select your working hours, the opportunity to experience new cultures, and the freedom from the restrictions of an actual office.
Geographic boundaries do not apply to digital nomads. They can wake up to the sunrise in Bali, eat lunch overlooking the Eiffel Tower, and conclude their day in California, all while satisfying their job duties. This way of life creates a sense of adventure and promotes personal and professional development by exposing you to new situations and viewpoints.
Bitcoin, the world’s first and most well-known cryptocurrency, lies at the heart of the digital nomad movement. It runs on a decentralized network, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries like banks. This financial flexibility appeals to digital nomads since it eliminates the burden of dealing with foreign currencies, expensive conversion fees, and international transaction delays.
Bitcoin also provides security and anonymity that traditional financial institutions do not. With cryptographic approaches safeguarding transactions, digital nomads can be confident in the security of their funds even when operating in unfamiliar or possibly unsafe areas. This protection is essential for those always on the road, ensuring their hard-earned money is always safe.
Another industry that has formed and quickly gained popularity in this era of digital nomadism and cryptocurrency is crypto casinos. These online gambling platforms only accept cryptocurrencies and allow players to play casino games with Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Several elements that resonate with the digital nomad lifestyle have contributed to the emergence of crypto casinos.
Privacy & Privacy: Bitcoin casinos provide players with a high level of privacy, allowing them to gamble without disclosing their identity. This feature is a massive benefit for digital nomads who value their privacy.
Global connectivity: A digital nomad can gamble in Bitcoin from anywhere worldwide if they have internet connectivity. This global accessibility is ideal for the itinerant lifestyle.
Fast and Low-Cost Transfers: Bitcoin is an excellent option for online gaming because of its quick transfers and low transaction costs. Bitcoin casinos do away with the fees and complicated banking procedures frequently associated with traditional casinos.
Innovative Games and Technology: To ensure fairness and transparency, Bitcoin casinos frequently integrate cutting-edge technology, such as blockchain, into their games. Additionally, they frequently provide particular games not seen in conventional casinos.
While making a living through online gambling may seem strange, it is a reality for some digital nomads. Competent players can use their knowledge of games like poker, blackjack, or sports betting to make a reliable living. The secret is to play strategically, comprehend the odds, and efficiently manage one’s bankroll.
Professional gamblers frequently consider their trade an investment, devoting time to learning the games, crafting winning tactics, and constantly honing their expertise. Some digital nomads have been able to live comfortably on the proceeds from crypto casinos by approaching gaming as a profession rather than a hobby.
However, it is critical to recognize the obstacles and hazards of relying on crypto casinos as a key source of revenue. Because gambling outcomes are unpredictable, financial stability is not guaranteed, and severe losses can occur. Whether digital nomads or not, individuals must gamble properly, set limits, and only bet what they can afford to lose.
Furthermore, the legal landscape around online gambling differs between countries and regions. Informing digital nomads of the legislation in the territories they visit is necessary to prevent legal complications related to online gambling. It is critical for any digital nomad involved in crypto casino activities to stay educated about the legality of online gambling activities and to follow local laws.
The convergence of digital nomadism and crypto casinos exemplifies the digital era’s continual transformation of work and pleasure. As technology advances and cryptocurrencies become more popular, the chances for making a living through unusual ways are expected to grow. With their adaptability and eagerness to adopt novel solutions, digital nomads are well-positioned to explore these areas further.
Furthermore, the connection between digital nomads and crypto casinos emphasizes the significance of financial education and digital literacy. Understanding the complexities of cryptocurrency, prudent financial management, and appropriate gambling habits are critical skills for those navigating this unique lifestyle.
Finally, the convergence of digital nomadism and crypto casinos indicates a paradigm shift in people’s perceptions of employment, pleasure, and financial transactions. While it provides unprecedented freedom and opportunities, it also requires a high level of responsibility, awareness, and adaptation from participating individuals. 
Individuals must balance embracing the potential and maintaining their well-being in this changing digital ecosystem as these trends continue to shape the future. Digital nomads and Bitcoin casinos exemplify the endless potential that develops when technology and lifestyle choices collide, inviting us to reconsider our ideas of work, leisure, and the digital world’s limitless horizons.

Kiyosaki Says Inflation Makes the Rich Richer;"In a recent tweet, the author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, claimed that inflation makes lower-income groups poorer while benefiting the wealthy.
INfLATION makes the POOR &MIDDLE CLASS poorer because they work for & save dollars. Yet INFLATION makes the RICH RICHER. Why?  Because today’s rich work for & save Gold, Silver, & Bitcoin.
Kiyosaki states that inflation erodes the purchasing power of dollar savings held by the poor and middle class, who rely on these funds. Meanwhile, the rich are shielded by investing in alternative assets like gold, silver, and bitcoin rather than cash.

Bitcoin’s wild ride to $30k and back reveals short-term holders’ market games;"The influence of short-term holders on Bitcoin’s market dynamics was palpable yesterday on Oct. 17, as Bitcoin prices surged to $30,000, fueled by the misinformation of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) being reported by CoinTelegraph.
Short-term holders, defined as investors who purchased Bitcoin within the last 155 days, capitalized on this surge, selling approximately 30,000 Bitcoins at a profit. This marked the third-highest such instance this year.
Historically, a similar trend has been observed during local bottoms in the price, as seen in January, March (following the SVB collapse), and June. In such instances, Bitcoin prices tended to appreciate, prompting this cohort to sell for profits. This behavior, however, exerts additional selling pressure on Bitcoin, creating potential short-term headwinds for the cryptocurrency’s price.
Conversely, last week, this group also accounted for the second-highest amount of Bitcoins sold at a loss this year. This occurred amidst widespread fear as Bitcoin prices plummeted to $26,000. While some of this can be attributed to traders locking in profits and losses due to Bitcoin’s minimal volatility this year, it underscores the significant role short-term holders play in the cryptocurrency’s price movements.
The supply of Bitcoin held by short-term holders has reached an all-time low of 2,357,000.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz Foresees Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval in 2023;"Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz expects a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to be approved in 2023. “It’s going to get approved, we think it happens this year,” the American investor said on Wednesday.
After predicting in August, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has accelerated his forecast regarding a spot bitcoin ETF. In mid-August, Novogratz believed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve one within four to six months. But on Wednesday, while speaking with Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” he said it’s likely to be approved in 2023.
“It’s going to get approved, we think it happens this year in 2023,” Novogratz remarked. He added that all the indications point to it happening this year. The Galaxy CEO further cited public commentary and filings noting that “people’s comments are much more constructive.”
Galaxy Digital has partnered with Invesco and competes with several major financial firms aiming to launch a spot-settled exchange-traded fund. The company collaborates with Invesco on the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users and Decentralized Commerce ETF, known as “BLKC,” and the “SATO” ETF. Novogratz mentioned that the SEC has been in discussions with Galaxy regarding the ETF.
“[The SEC is] no longer talking about how [bitcoin] works or why it’s important. It’s just a recognized macro asset and that’s a huge psychological shift,” Novogratz explained on Wednesday.
He believes that current events indicate approval is imminent. His statements come after Blackrock CEO Larry Fink described the recent surge, following false ETF approval rumors, as a “flight to quality.” Novogratz highlighted Blackrock’s comments, emphasizing that interest from the world’s largest fund manager is a positive indicator. He also stressed, “The public wants this.” Novogratz’s statements follow Fidelity amending its spot bitcoin ETF filing on October 17.
What do you think about Novogratz’s commentary about a spot bitcoin ETF being approved this year? Do you agree with his prediction? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.

Coinbase’s push for regulation hits roadblock as Hamas exploits crypto;"Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, is facing challenges in its lobbying efforts in the United States due to the recent use of cryptocurrency by Hamas militants to fund attacks in Israel, according to a new report by Berenberg Capital Markets. The report, authored by lead analyst Mark Palmer, highlights the regulatory actions and political headwinds arising from the Israel-Hamas conflict as key factors impacting Coinbase’s outlook.
Hamas, a Palestinian militant organization, has reportedly utilized cryptocurrencies for fundraising purposes, particularly in the context of recent attacks on Israel. Last week, Israeli authorities took action by shutting down and seizing over 100 accounts on various cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, which were being used to support Hamas in its fundraising efforts. This crackdown resulted in the seizure of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency assets.
It is worth noting that while Hamas had previously declared that it would no longer use cryptocurrencies for fundraising due to concerns about authorities tracking transactions on blockchain ledgers, the recent developments have raised questions about the legal status of cryptocurrencies in such situations.
Coinbase has been actively engaged in lobbying efforts in the United States in recent years, seeking clearer and more crypto-friendly regulations. However, these efforts now face headwinds from regulatory actions and political developments linked to the Israel-Hamas conflict.
The report from Berenberg highlights the challenges posed by ongoing regulatory actions against Coinbase in the United States, including efforts to define the legal framework for cryptocurrencies. The use of crypto by Hamas in its fundraising efforts adds complexity to the regulatory landscape.
In light of the various challenges facing Coinbase, Berenberg analysts have taken a cautious stance on the company. They have reiterated their “hold” recommendation on Coinbase (COIN) stock and maintained a price target of $39. This recommendation reflects their view that, in the near term, Coinbase’s stock presents investment challenges.
Mark Palmer, the lead analyst at Berenberg, noted, 
“We continue to view COIN through a cautious lens, especially after the stock has traded up by more than 112% this year versus ~72% for Bitcoin and ~29% for the tech-heavy Nasdaq.” 
This cautious stance underscores the uncertainty surrounding Coinbase’s future in the face of regulatory and geopolitical dynamics.
At the time of this report, Coinbase shares were trading at $77.30, representing a 3% increase for the day. The market’s response suggests a level of investor interest and optimism despite the challenges outlined in the Berenberg report.
Coinbase, a major player in the cryptocurrency industry, is facing setbacks in its lobbying efforts in the United States due to the use of cryptocurrency by Hamas for fundraising activities. The regulatory and political implications of these developments are creating uncertainty for Coinbase’s future, and Berenberg analysts have taken a cautious stance in their evaluation of the company.

Bitcoin Maintains $28K But These Altcoins Keep Losing Value (Market Watch);"Bitcoin’s attempt to overcome the $29,000 level yesterday saw no success, and the asset has lost some ground but still stands above $28,000.
The altcoins have turned red on a daily scale now. The only exceptions from the larger ones are LEO, UNI, and MNT.
The start of the business week was quite positive for the primary cryptocurrency, which pumped by around a grand on Monday morning after a sluggish weekend. Furthermore, one of the most notable price pumps in months came later that day amid false reports claiming that the US SEC had finally approved a spot Bitcoin ETF.
The asset reacted with an instant $2,000 surge that drove it to a 2-month peak at around $30,000. As the reports were denied, though, BTC started losing value just as rapidly and went back down to $28,000.
The bulls tried to initiate a few more price pumps the following days, which culminated in another challenge of $29,000 yesterday. However, the cryptocurrency failed to overcome that level and has lost several hundred dollars since then.
As of now, BTC trades just inches above $28,000, but its market capitalization has remained north of $550 billion. Its dominance over the altcoins is still riding high at over 51% on CMC.
Most alternative coins mimicked BTC’s pump and dump following the fake reports but are now trading in the red.
Ethereum went to almost $1,700 but struggles to remain above $1,550 as of now, following another 1.3% daily drop. Binance Coin has declined by a similar percentage to $210.
Ripple, Cardano, Toncoin, Polygon, Polkadot, Litecoin, Shiba Inu, and AVAX have dropped by around 2% in a day.
LEO, UNI, and MNT are among the few exceptions, with minor increases over the past 24 hours.
Overall, the total crypto market cap has lost some steam and sits around $1.080 trillion on CMC.

ProShares to Launch Short Ether Strategy ETF (SETH) in November;"ProShares is gearing up to introduce a unique offering to the market. The firm recently launched three Ethereum futures ETFs and is now preparing to debut the ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF (SETH).
This new ETF is poised to launch in early November, just a few weeks after the initial Ethereum futures ETFs debuted.
According to a recent filing, SETH will be listed on the NYSE Arca exchange. It is designed to deliver daily investment results that align with the inverse performance of the S&P CME Ether Futures Index.
It’s worth noting that SETH does not directly short Ethereum (ETH) but instead aims to capitalize on declines in the asset’s price, as outlined in the prospectus.
UPDATE: ProShares will be launching a short #Ethereum Futures ETF. Looks like it should begin trading on October 16th (This coming Monday).
Ticker is $SETH

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, ProShares is anticipating the registration statement for SETH to become effective on Oct. 15, with the official launch of the ETF slated for early November.
This move follows ProShares’ introduction of three Ethereum futures funds earlier this month. Among these, two ETFs invest in both Ethereum and Bitcoin futures contracts. The trio of Ethereum ETFs made their debut on Oct. 2, joining similar products from VanEck and Bitwise in a rapidly expanding market.
Notably, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of Ethereum futures ETFs arrived nearly two years after the introduction of the first Bitcoin futures ETF, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which entered the market in October 2021.
ProShares has been a trailblazer in the cryptocurrency ETF space, previously releasing Bitcoin futures ETFs, including the Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF, in June 2022. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF has accumulated approximately $850 million in assets, while the Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF boasts around $75 million in assets.
The growing interest in cryptocurrency-based ETFs is evident, with investment firms increasingly looking to capitalize on the trend. After BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin ETF, numerous other firms rallied behind it, all seeking to introduce their Bitcoin-related investment products. Now, these firms are shifting their focus to Ethereum, with a notable surge in interest in creating Ethereum ETFs.

SEC nears decisive move on multiple Bitcoin ETFs, JPMorgan says;"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is showing signs of expediting approvals for multiple spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This anticipation builds upon the SEC’s lack of action in appealing a court case it lost to Grayscale Investments. According to analysts at JPMorgan—led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou—on Wednesday,  the regulatory body will most likely finalize these approvals within months, potentially ahead of January 10, 2024. This date marks the final deadline for applications from Ark Invest and 21Shares, among others.
Moreover, the SEC’s silence in the Grayscale case has set the stage for an interesting twist. Grayscale may have to tweak its fee structure to keep up with the new normal. Besides, according to JPMorgan analysts, this adjustment benefits investors to the tune of $2 billion.
Additionally, the SEC doesn’t intend to favor any spot Bitcoin ETF applicant with first-mover advantage. Analysts from JPMorgan speculate that the regulatory body plans to give multiple nods in one go. This is significant because it allows for an arena where competition, particularly regarding ETF fees, will thrive.
Furthermore, analysts caution that these approvals are unlikely to drastically alter the crypto market dynamics or become a game-changer. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, available in both Canada and Europe, have yet to see a substantial inflow of investor interest. However, JPMorgan analysts maintain that the market should witness more fee competition, which is a win for investors.
In light of the imminent approvals, JPMorgan analysts are expecting a fee war among the new entrants. Consequently, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, currently the largest Bitcoin fund globally with $17.7 billion in assets under management, will likely have to cut its fees. This change is because an ETF structure allows for a more efficient share redemption and creation mechanism.
Significantly, the current discount to Grayscale’s net asset value (NAV) stands at around -13%. This discount has been narrowing ever since Grayscale emerged victorious from its court battle. Analysts project this discount will disappear once Grayscale transitions its fund into an ETF.
Therefore, while the crypto community is abuzz with the prospects of multiple Bitcoin ETF approvals, the focus seems to be shifting toward what these approvals will mean for investors. The debate now lies in how these new structures will impact the current fee paradigms and whether that change will be enough to attract more significant investor interest.

Solana Is Winning The Energy-Efficiency Race But Ethereum “Is Too Large To Ignore”;"One developer, “0xIchigo,” behind Helius, a software company developing infrastructure for users to build on Solana, thinks Solana is winning the energy efficiency race. However, competing platforms, especially Ethereum, are here to stay.
Ethereum and Solana aim to serve the same user base, but the former was the first to launch, with the latter being a generation-4 blockchain. It seeks to resolve challenges faced by the original smart contract platform. For this reason, Solana is more performant and has higher throughput, though there have been instances where its reliability has been questioned.
On energy efficiency, the developer noted that for every transaction confirmed on Bitcoin, the world’s most valuable network using the proof-of-work consensus algorithm, 5 billion Joules of energy is spent. A similar transaction on Ethereum will see 144k Joules of energy expended. Meanwhile, the same on Solana will see 658 Joules of energy consumed, less than what goes into a “Google search.”
The high energy spent on Bitcoin is primarily because of the ledger’s consensus algorithm, which requires miners to spend electricity as they run gear, competing to solve cryptographic problems. Successful miners add the valid block of transactions to the chain in exchange for a 6.25 BTC reward and transaction fees accumulated from the block. 
The proof-of-work consensus algorithm is usually more energy-intensive and consumes more energy than alternative systems used by Solana and Ethereum. Ethereum shifted to a proof-of-stake system in September 2022. 
It depends on validators who don’t have to run expensive gear but stake at least 32 ETH. As of October 18, there were more than  978,000 validators. Meanwhile, over 1,970 validators were securing and validating transactions on Solana.
While energy efficiency is one of the key metrics being considered, especially by protocols launching on smart contract platforms, activity is critical. So far, Ethereum is one of the most active smart contract platforms, looking at, for instance, the total value locked (TVL) by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Ethereum manages over $20 billion of DeFi assets, while Solana trails at around $324 million.
This could be why 0xIchigo, though pointing out the advantage of Solana, is adamant that Ethereum and its virtual machine (EVM) are “too large to ignore.” Still, in the developer’s assessment, this advantage makes the EVM rigid and hard to scale over time. Transaction fees, which fluctuate, greatly impact the virtual machine, making it a less desirable option for payment companies.

Bitcoin Dominance Surpassed 2.5-Year High—A Sign of Next Bull Run?;"The post Bitcoin Dominance Surpassed 2.5-Year High—A Sign of Next Bull Run? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market is soaring, posing a dilemma for investors: stick with the tried-and-true or bet on high-potential altcoins. As prices surge, the choice becomes crucial. Hence, Bitcoin prices are keenly watched by investors. Bitcoin might spark a cryptocurrency market boom if the price stays above $25,000.
Despite the recent downturn, Bitcoin’s dominance rate gauges its share in the total cryptocurrency market and surged to a notable 52.45% – a pinnacle not witnessed in 2.5 years. This upswing, marking the highest since April 2021, as reported by TradingView, indicates a potential reversal in the trend that favored alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) over Bitcoin in early 2021.
Looking at the broader space, this current ascent aligns with the bullish breakout observed in June, signifying the conclusion of an extended consolidation phase oscillating between 38% and 48%. According to technical analysis by Fairlead Strategies, this trajectory is anticipated to persist in the upcoming days, potentially overturning the decline observed from 60% to 40% during the dynamic bull market period of March to April 2021. 
Shedding more light on the recent trend, Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, expressed confidence in Bitcoin’s continued dominance. She highlighted, “The index is poised to extend higher, especially after resolving a two-year trading range higher this summer.” Stockton’s long-term trend-following indicators also support the notion of increased Bitcoin dominance, with further room for overcoming resistance. This suggests that Bitcoin may outperform altcoins, potentially undoing some of the gains made by altcoins in the first half of 2021.
However, experts have also noted that the focus may be shifted towards the Fibonacci resistance level at 60.17% once the dominance rate consolidates its position above the June high of 52.18%. As of the latest update, the dominance rate stands at 51.68%. If Dominance Holds more than 52% support, then be ready for another 30%-40% altcoins dump. 
The critical catalysts behind Bitcoin’s bull run are the hash rate, the US election, Bitcoin ETFs, and the halving event. Now, “Bitcoin dominance” enters the scene, measuring Bitcoin’s trade volume compared to the overall crypto market. Bitcoin is riding a bullish wave, surging to $28,460.79 with a market cap of USD 555.45B. In the last 24 hours, it gained +2.55%, demonstrating strong momentum.
This phoenix-like resurgence in Bitcoin’s dominance reflects its catchy appeal and hints at a potential reevaluation by investors regarding the relative merits of Bitcoin versus alternative cryptocurrencies. As the market dynamics evolve, it will be fascinating to observe how this trend unfolds and its implications for the broader crypto space.

Coinhouse announces the layoff of 15% of its workforce;"The cryptocurrency industry has been experiencing a series of layoffs recently, with French crypto firm Coinhouse being the latest to announce staff reductions. The company confirmed that it will be cutting 15% of its workforce, with reports suggesting that 10 employees out of a total headcount of 70 have been let go. This marks a significant change for the company, as it had 100 employees just a year ago but now operates with a staff of 60.
Coinhouse, based in Paris, is a crypto broker that allows investors to buy and sell up to 40 different cryptocurrencies. Established in 2015, it earned recognition as one of the first entities to secure registration as a digital asset service provider (PSAN) from the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) in 2020. Furthermore, it obtained a license from the Luxembourg financial regulator, enabling it to conduct business in the Luxembourg market. The company justified these layoffs by pointing to reduced enthusiasm for Web3, along with a global economic environment that is considered fragile and has been constraining the development of the crypto market and its participants.
Coinhouse’s CEO, Nicolas Louvet, emphasized the company’s commitment to supporting the departing employees. Coinhouse’s decision to downsize signifies a shift in its focus towards helping other companies and institutions shape their strategies related to Web3, the next generation of the internet. Additionally, the company has plans to expand its services, including the upcoming launch of a Euro Account. Coinhouse is not the only crypto-related company in France to make workforce reductions. Just two weeks prior, another industry leader, Ledger, announced a 12% reduction in its workforce.
The ripple effect of these layoffs is not confined to France. NFT (Non-Fungible Token) powerhouse Bored Ape Yacht Club creator, Yuga Labs, confirmed that they had made additional staff cuts at the beginning of October. The CEO of Yuga Labs, Daniel Alegre, explained that the decision was influenced by the realization that certain projects, while well-intentioned, either stretched the team too thin or demanded execution expertise beyond the company’s core competencies. These downsizing events in the cryptocurrency industry have occurred against the backdrop of significant price declines for two of the most well-known cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Bitcoin has seen a 60% drop from its all-time high of around $69,000 in November 2021, while Ethereum has experienced a 67% decline from its high of $4,878, also set at the same time. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and these layoffs may be a reflection of the challenges that companies in the industry face when dealing with such fluctuations. While the market has seen periods of explosive growth, it has also been prone to sharp corrections and price declines. The reduced enthusiasm for Web3 mentioned by Coinhouse could be related to the uncertainty surrounding this emerging field. Web3 represents a new vision for the internet, one that aims to decentralize control and empower users.
However, it is still in its infancy, and the path to its widespread adoption remains uncertain. This uncertainty can influence investment and development decisions in the crypto space. Furthermore, the global economic environment has been described as fragile, which could impact the crypto market. Cryptocurrencies are often viewed as a hedge against economic instability, but they are not immune to the broader economic forces at play. Economic factors, regulatory changes, and market sentiment can all affect the performance of cryptocurrencies.
In this context, Coinhouse’s shift in focus towards helping other companies and institutions shape their Web3 strategies is interesting. It suggests that, despite the challenges in the cryptocurrency market, there is still belief in the long-term potential of blockchain technology and decentralized applications. The forthcoming launch of a Euro Account by Coinhouse indicates a continued commitment to expanding its services. Offering a Euro Account could make it easier for users to engage with cryptocurrencies, as it provides a familiar currency for transactions and investments.
This move could be seen as an effort to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world. While the recent layoffs in the cryptocurrency industry may raise concerns, it’s essential to remember that the market is dynamic and constantly evolving. Companies are making strategic adjustments based on the current landscape, and the long-term prospects of the crypto space remain a topic of great interest and debate. As for Bitcoin and Ethereum, their price fluctuations are not uncommon in the cryptocurrency market. Investors and enthusiasts continue to closely monitor these digital assets, looking for opportunities and trying to navigate the ever-changing crypto landscape.

Is the SEC Shifting to a Softer Stance Against Crypto? Pro-XRP Lawyer Comments;"TL;DR

John E Deaton – a US attorney representing thousands of Ripple investors in the lawsuit against Ripple – assumed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might have changed its stance towards the cryptocurrency industry. He based his theory on the fact that the agency did not use the fake BTC ETF news that circulated the space earlier this week as an opportunity to bash the digital asset sector.
Deaton reminded this was not the case in the past when the SEC’s Chairman Gary Gensler used to criticize crypto and link it to terrorism funding and criminal activity every time he had this option.
“I could be wrong, but I attribute it to the Court loss coupled with the Larry Fink affect. Gensler only cares about what the major incumbent donors, I mean institutions think.”
The lawyer’s opinion about the SEC’s softened approach coincides with the one shared by Scott Melker, better known as “The Wolf of All Streets.” The latter argued in a recent X (Twitter) post that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is just around the corner since “the language and tone have changed.”
The breaking reports from October 16 that America’s securities regulator has finally approved BlackRock’s application to introduce a spot BTC ETF in the States infused enthusiasm in the crypto space while the entire market flashed green. The price of the primary digital asset, for one, surged by over 10% in a matter of minutes to as high as $29,500 (per CoinGecko).
Nonetheless, the jolly was short-lived as it turned out that there was no such official approval. The SEC also chipped in, saying people should not trust everything they read on the Internet and verify information with original sources.
Deaton disagreed with the statement, maintaining that independent judges who oversee the watchdog are more trustworthy than the agency itself. Subsequently, he claimed that an Appellate Court found the SEC to be “arbitrary and capricious:”
“Finally, a federal judge in the SDNY called the SEC lawyers hypocrites and stated they lacked faithful allegiance to the law. So, when it comes to the SEC, I choose to listen to judges. And man, are they speaking loudly.”

Bitcoin Mining Operations Education Program For Energy Producers;"We are a world built on top of the rails afforded energy and power production. Whether we are discussing your smartphone in your hand, the shirt on your back, the home or apartment you reside in, or the electricity that is serviced to your domicile… none of that would be available without energy generation and power production. 
Within this vein it is imperative that the reader understand not just how important energy and power provision is to the world, but also how sensitive these mechanisms are. Whether we are dealing in molecules (such as oil and gas) or in electrons (power) both are commodities, meaning that supply and demand exert great influence over the pricing of these products. The pull or push of supply and demand can be influenced by forces such as weather (outside of human influence) as well as human legislation such as regulations over emissions standards, tariffs, and sanctions. 
Verde Mining
“Verde Mining's course ‘How to mine on flare gas’ was fantastic. The team, information, classroom, and field instruction are top notch. I walked away with all the tools and contacts necessary to confidently source, structure, fund, build, and operate a flare gas mine. This is more than just some instructional course, it is an intimate, student focused, hands on relationship building experience. Verde Mining is passionate about their mission, and I highly recommend for anyone, at any stage of their journey, to experience such an atmosphere of dedicated and knowledgeable instruction.”
– Joe Hamlin
Further weighing on the pricing mechanism for these commodities is their transportation to market. As discussed between Paul Cockerham CEO of Verde Mining on the Hashrate Up podcast (linked here), there is added difficulty for oil and gas producers to transport material to such a market (or buyer) when a project must build out infrastructure to enable transmission. Will the owners of the land that a project has to traverse permit building of infrastructure through their property? They have every right to refuse. Then there’s the matter of paying for said infrastructure to get a molecule like natural gas to a buyer. All of these dynamics must be incorporated into the decision-making on what to do with production of a resource, and especially for a resource that comes as a byproduct of production of a completely different resource, in this case oil. 
Verde Mining
That’s a lot of hoops to dance through for producers. It’s no surprise why so many have elected to simply vent or burn (aka flaring) their natural gas yield off oil production rather than engage in capital expenditure (capex) for building out such infrastructure. This is why bitcoin miners are engaging in joint venture (JV) agreements with oil producers while compensating these operations by paying for this resource at the location of production; the well-head. This allows for the producer to avoid the capex of building out the infrastructure to transport their gas production to a buyer by bringing the producer onsite and earning revenue off the production of bitcoin by integrating bitcoin mining into their production stack. 
“It's rare in this business to find someone who has deep field experience in both O&G and Bitcoin, and is willing to share all his valuable knowledge. Enter Paul Cockerham, the OG of flare gas mining. I attended Verde's course in Midland and received the best education one could imagine in the flare gas niche. Paul's level of transparency, passion and teaching skills were off the chart. I don't think you'll find any better course or instructor. Five-star rating!” 
– Frank Eakin 
Verde Mining is taking a cleverly novel approach to this relationship. On top of providing these services to oil producers with complementary natural gas production the Verde Mining team also hosts educational courses to teach producers how they can incorporate bitcoin mining operations into their projects. They have a course coming up here in a few weeks lasting 3 days that covers: miner assembly, repair, and configuration, network & IT setup, and engineering, maintenance and electrical work. Complete with operation walkthroughs onsite and covering of financial models for operational prudence. For those that are interested, or have an employer that is interested, in such an education check out their twitter, linkedin, and send inquiries to: mike@verdemining.com. 
We need as many individuals and organizations getting educated on not only the value of bitcoin mining but also the know-how for safe and properly functioning bitcoin mining operations.

Crypto Research Firm Predicts 200% XRP Price Rally To $1.5;"As the XRP price and its future trajectory continue to be a hot topic for debate, crypto research firm Sistine Research has weighed in on this debate using technical analysis. XRP holders are set to love this one, as their prediction is bullish. 
In a post shared on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, Sistine Research stated that, despite the current market outlook, XRP is one of the tokens with a bullish chart in the crypto market as of now. 
Their bullish sentiment was projected in their post, which contained a weekly chart that suggested an accumulated pattern since May 2022, with the XRP price having the potential to rally to as high as $1.5, an over 200% increase from its current price of $0.49.

The research firm also used the XRP/Bitcoin chart to further drive home their bullish sentiment. The chart showed XRP’s potential to outperform the flagship cryptocurrency with its projected rally to $1.5. However, it seems that the XRP price could decline to the $0.40 support level before any massive rally.

Sensing that there was some form of skepticism from many in the crypto community, Sistine Research released a subsequent post where it further elaborated on its technical analysis. It explained that from the charts, it was evident that there is a long-term accumulation that is trending upwards. 
According to them, during this period, buyers are willing to dive into the market and provide support to the token at higher and higher prices, likely suggesting that a potential retracement or dump by the bears doesn’t faze the bulls. 
Sistine alluded to the fact that the most recent pump on the chart was larger than the previous pump. This supposedly shows that buyers are active as they are still accumulating at higher prices rather than waiting for a decline before going in. While all this is happening, sellers are still holding their tokens as they anticipate higher prices before selling. 
They compared this XRP chart to the BTC chart in 2018, when buyers got weaker, and sellers had control of the market, selling every pump at lower prices. 
The research firm also suggested that DOGE’s chart is currently experiencing something similar (to the 2018 BTC chart) as they stated that the XRP price chart is “objectively bullish” in comparison to the meme coin, which is “exhibiting major signs of buyer exhaustion.”
As of the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at $0.49, around 0.30% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This is Warren Buffett’s Top Stock in 2023 (Hint: It’s Got Something to do With Crypto);"Berkshire Hathaway’s top performer this year is Brazilian bank Nubank. The São Paulo-headquartered bank touts itself as a “neobank” and offers blockchain products to its customers.
Nubank allows customers to hold and trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. It also launched its own crypto, Nucoin, in 2022.
Berkshire has invested $750 million in the Brazilian bank, in an overall stake now worth $840 million. As Forbes Digital Assets reports:
“Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invested $500 million in Brazil’s Nubank in June 2021 ahead of its initial public offering (IPO) later that year. Buffett’s Nubank holding is thought to be now worth around $840 million after he plowed another $250 million into the startup bank during its IPO.”
Nubank’s stock has gained over 100% in market value year-to-date. Here are some more details of Berkshire’s lucrative stake in Nubank from Investing.com:
“Berkshire initially invested in Nubank during its IPO in 2021, securing 107 million shares that represented a 2% stake. Despite an initial dip of 13% from the IPO price, Nubank’s shares have since recovered, contributing to the substantial gain for Berkshire.”
Over the past year, Nubank has grown its customer base as well as its novel product offerings. Meanwhile, the bank is expanding into Columbia and Mexico with personal loan products.
Long-dubbed the Oracle of Omaha for his prescience in picking businesses to invest in that deliver outstanding ROIs, Warren Buffett has been sour on cryptocurrencies for most of their short history.
In fact, both Warren Buffett and his longtime partner Charlie Munger have been vociferous critics of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, calling them immoral and “rat poison squared.”
Buffett has joked he wouldn’t buy all the Bitcoin in the world for $25 and said it has no intrinsic value other than as an instrument for gambling.
But with its large stake in Nubank, Berkshire Hathaway seems to be making a handsome profit from the blockchain sector this year. Has the old guard in financial investing finally flipped?
This is assuredly a very bullish sign for mainstream acceptance and institutional adoption of blockchain. That’s especially so when considering the vast bulk of Tradfi holdings in Berkshire’s portfolio, multi-billion dollar stakes in Bank of America, Citigroup, and Visa.
By the way, this isn’t the first time Buffett’s best investment was a Fintech in Brazil. In 2019,Wa his best performer was a Brazilian digital payments company, StoneCo.

Ethereum and One XRP Rival Dominating Institutional Interest for Real-World Asset Tokenization: Bloomberg Analyst;"A Bloomberg crypto market analyst says Ethereum (ETH) and one XRP rival are dominating institutional interest in real-world assets issued on public blockchains.
Jamie Coutts says on the social media platform X that traditional finance is driving real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and he predicts that more firms will enter the space soon.
“Growth is off a low base, but it is rising steadily. Demand is also emanating from emerging markets, which is not surprising given stablecoin adoption.”
Coutts notes that the tokenization of US money market funds is now nearing $700 million in total value, up from $100 million at the start of the year.
A money market fund is a type of mutual fund that seeks yield by investing in highly liquid short-term debt instruments like US treasuries, cash and cash-equivalent securities.
Ethereum is the first choice of network for tokenized money market instruments in the US, clocking $345 million in value, though Stellar (XLM) is close behind with $321.2 million, according to Coutts. Blockchain scaling solution Polygon (MATIC) ranks third, with $23.7 million.
According to the Bloomberg analyst, RWA tokenization could be one of the biggest drivers for blockchain adoption.
“Thoughts: while stablecoins are likely the most significant driver for blockchain adoption, NFTs (non-fungible tokens), GameFi and now tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), while nascent present immense potential.”

Large Chainlink Holders Accumulate $38,500,000 in LINK in One Week While Retail Traders Take Profit: Santiment;"Crypto analytics firm Santiment finds that large wallets are gobbling up the native asset of the decentralized oracle network Chainlink (LINK).
Santiment notes that addresses holding between 100,000 and 1 million LINK have accumulated $38.5 million worth of the crypto asset in the past week.
The firm says those significant wallet moves are “more relevant than small retail traders taking profits.”
IntoTheBlock, a different crypto analytics platform, notes that large holders have acquired $121 million worth of LINK in the past month.
Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe thinks Chainlink is starting a new uptrend. He argues that traders shouldn’t be too concerned about LINK’s correction in the past couple of weeks, which saw the asset decrease in price by nearly 10% from a high of $8.23 in late September.
“I think, if Chainlink remains priced above $6.70-7.00, we’re ready for a breakout to the upside and out of this mindblowing range.”
Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa noted last week that LINK has remained in an accumulation range for more than 500 days. He predicted the asset “will fly one day.”
LINK is trading at $7.42 at time of writing. The 18th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 20% in the past 30 days.

Reddit To Phase Out Ethereum-Based Incentives System, Citing Scaling and Regulatory Challenges: Report;"Reddit reportedly plans to discontinue its Ethereum (ETH)-based rewards program called Community Points by next month.
Community Points allow Redditors who make high-quality contributions to the platform such as creating content and moderating to earn ERC-20 tokens that can be used to redeem badges, animated emoticons and other special features.
According to Reddit, Community Points serve as a measure of a user’s reputation in participating subreddits and give Redditors a chance to own a piece of their favorite communities.
Despite high hopes for the program, TechCrunch reports that Reddit will say goodbye to Community Points by early November three years after launching the project in May 2020.
Reddit’s director of consumer and product communications Tim Rathschmidt says Community Points faces two challenges that prompted the platform to phase out the program.
“Though we saw some future opportunities for Community Points, the resourcing needed was unfortunately too high to justify, The regulatory environment has since added to that effort. Though the moderators and communities that supported Community Points have been incredible partners — as it’s evolved, the product is no longer set up to scale.”
After launching Community Points, Reddit also rolled out other incentive systems, which include the Contributor Program that allows eligible users to convert their Reddit gold and karma into cash.
Rathschmidt says Reddit will prioritize community rewards programs that are less difficult to scale.
“Part of why we’re moving past this product is that we’ve already launched, or are actively investing in, several products that accomplish what the Community Points program was trying to accomplish while being easier to adopt and understand.”

The Fake Bitcoin ETF Approval News Liquidated Over $74 Million;"The community was ecstatic when Bitcoin prices spiked to around $30,000 on October 16 following unconfirmed reports that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved the country’s first spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). 
When the moment of fear of missing out (FOMO) had subsided, and alleged reports of the stringent agency approving the complex derivative turned out to be fake, prices swung wildly, almost wiping out gains made. As a result, over $74 million derivatives positions from across multiple crypto exchanges, mostly OKX, Binance, and Bybit, had been forcibly closed in liquidation.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $28,200, almost $2,000 down from October 16 highs, highlighting the level of volatility, especially in the BTC markets. Following the rally and sharp retracement, data from Coinalyze shows that $56.6 million short positions were liquidated. 
At the same time, $18.4 million of long positions were closed. A big chunk of shorts, roughly $51 million, were from perpetual futures offered by exchanges like OKX, Binance, and ByBit. 
Most traders were liquidated on OKX, with a big percentage shorting the price action. Specifically, $17.6 million of shorts were forcefully closed, with $6.24 million of longs closed. Similar positions in Binance and Bybit were also unwound. 
The aggregated amount highlighted represents traders who aim to take advantage of price movements using leverage. With perpetual contracts, traders can go long (buy) or short (sell), using up to 100X leverage in some exchanges. 
Leverage allows traders to increase their position sizes by borrowing funds from the exchange. In turn, the exchange will close a position if prices move against the trader, confiscating the collateral they had placed before opening.
The rumor that the SEC had approved the Bitcoin ETF applied by BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, has been denied. As of mid-October, the SEC has yet to greenlight any spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms, including Fidelity. The SEC has been under increasing pressure to approve the product. 
Approving a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC would be a breakthrough for crypto. Notably, it might simplify how institutions gain exposure to Bitcoin in a regulated manner. The broader community remains bullish on BTC in the coming months. 
Coupled with the fact that the network will slash network rewards by half in 2024, some analysts expect prices to break above immediate resistance at around $32,000 following a spot BTC ETF approval.

Crypto Disclosure: Global Regulator’s New Banking Directive;"The crypto sphere is gradually merging with the conventional financial sector. Numerous businesses and financial institutions have been adopting cryptocurrencies. Amidst this, banks are departing from traditional finance to embrace digitalization through crypto. Nevertheless, adhering to this transformation involves adhering to specific regulations. According to preliminary guidance released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, banks are required to provide both quantitative and qualitative details regarding their cryptocurrency activities.
The Basel Committee’s decision to enforce greater disclosure in crypto-related activities is a response to growing concerns regarding the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, these regulations add to the existing capital requirements designed to discourage banks from holding unsecured cryptocurrencies. This includes Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH]. The urgency of these measures has been underscored by recent turbulence affecting banks with crypto exposure. This includes Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.
The Basel Committee, which operates under the umbrella of the Bank for International Settlements, is a consortium of central banks. Its headquarters is in Basel, Switzerland. It has emphasized the necessity of standardizing disclosure formats. This standardization serves a dual purpose: it promotes market discipline and mitigates information imbalances between banks and other market participants.
Also Read: How Many Banks Are Using Cryptocurrency?
The proposed guidelines will likely take effect in 2025. Under this, banks will have to furnish comprehensive details concerning their interactions with cryptocurrency assets. This entails providing qualitative insights into their crypto-related operations and quantitative information on their exposure to cryptocurrencies, along with the corresponding capital and liquidity requirements.

Furthermore, as the cryptocurrency industry continues its evolution and digital assets become increasingly integrated into traditional financial systems, these regulatory measures have become indispensable.

Onramp, BitGo Unveil Bitcoin Custody Solution to Tap Trillions in Institutional Capital;"Onramp, a bitcoin asset management firm, has officially announced the launch of their new multisig custody platform. In an era where the way bitcoins are stored and managed becomes crucial, Onramp brings an innovative solution that promises to set a new standard in the industry.
Traditional bitcoin storage methods have posed a significant dilemma for both institutions and individual investors. While some prefer the self-custody approach due to its direct control, many are wary of its technical complexities and potential security issues. On the other hand, centralized custodial options come with their own set of risks.
To bridge this gap, Onramp has partnered with BitGo, Coincover and Kingdom Trust to offer a solution that aims to combine the best of both worlds. Their approach aims to cater to institutional allocators, financial intermediaries, and high net worth individuals by offering a trust-minimized custodial solution. By doing so, they aim to remove the traditional single points of failure that often come with trusting one entity with custody.
Central to Onramp's strategy is their Multi-Institution Custody solution. By leveraging the tried-and-tested multisig capabilities of bitcoin, they've established institutional-grade vaults that are controlled by three distinct institutional key holders: BitGo Trust, Kingdom Trust, and Coincover. In order to access the funds in these vaults, authorization from at least two of the three keys is required, ensuring that no single entity has unilateral control over the assets.
BitGo, Inc., is a leader in digital asset infrastructure, and the company brings a wealth of expertise to the table. Kingdom Trust holds the distinction of being the first Qualified Custodian to handle bitcoin, and Coincover is recognized as a blockchain protection company. Onramp's Multi-Institution Custody solution leveraging multisig ensures that while the company is working with top-tier entities in bitcoin custody, the necessary trust for each institutional key-holder is minimized.
This solution comes at a time when many institutions have been hesitant about entrusting their bitcoins to a single custodian. With Onramp’s offering, the challenges that come with traditional bitcoin custody methods are eliminated, making it easier for institutional capital allocators to access the cryptocurrency.
In addition to their flagship custody offering, Onramp also boasts a suite of products and services tailor-made for various investors. From their Bitcoin Custody service, which aids both new and existing bitcoin holders, to their Bitcoin Fund that allows traditional investment access to bitcoin, Onramp’s focus is to provide solutions that combine bitcoin’s inherent properties with the benefits of institutional-grade custody.

Australia Government Wants Crypto Exchanges to Possess a Financial Services License;"Australia-based crypto exchanges may soon be required to hold a financial services license issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The Australian government expects to have the draft legislation ready in 2024. According to the proposals, crypto exchanges will be given a period of twelve months to comply with the new regulations. 
Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Australia will soon be required to possess a financial services license issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. According to a proposal reportedly put forward by the Australian government, only crypto exchanges that hold more than $3.2 million (A$5 million) will need to obtain a permit from the country’s regulator of the financial services sector.
As per a Bloomberg report, Australian authorities believe the imposition of this requirement will not only help protect consumers but will play a part in supporting the growth of the digital assets market. The report added that the Aussie government expects to have a draft legislation ready sometime in 2024.
Once the draft is passed into law, crypto exchanges will be given a twelve-month grace period to comply with the new rules, the report added.
Meanwhile, in a document released on Oct. 16 by the Treasury Department, the government acknowledged that the proposed rules for crypto exchanges are based on laws currently governing the financial services industry. Commenting on the government’s proposals, Caroline Bowler, the CEO at BTC Markets Pty, said:
“A positive progression for the crypto industry. It is imperative the country keeps pace with our international peers, with a robust regulatory framework.”
According to the report, the proposals made by Australian authorities relate to custody and transaction standards. They also touch on exchanges’ obligations when it comes to staking and trading.

Cardano Founder Decodes SEC’s Over-Planned Strategy In XRP Lawsuit;"The post Cardano Founder Decodes SEC’s Over-Planned Strategy In XRP Lawsuit appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
It’s so clear that over the years, XRP has grown to be one of the most talked about tokens but also one of the most fearless tokens. Charles Hoskinson can’t stop talking about ETHGate & the XRP Community. Do you ever wonder why? It all started with the endless backlash he faced from the community on rumored comments on the ETH floodgate theory. After denying such claims, here’s what he says about the SEC’s manipulative role in the XRP lawsuit. 
Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has weighed in on the XRP lawsuit, believing that XRP should not be considered a security. He addressed concerns about potential bias in the SEC’s decision-making process, emphasizing the need for concrete evidence to support such claims. On the flip side, Hoskinson has tried all the means to settle his scores with the XRP community, and with this support, will it avert the storm of reactions from XRP fans? Let’s take a look. 
Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson has significantly intervened in the ongoing XRP lawsuit, asserting that XRP should not be categorized as a security. Hoskinson addressed two pivotal concerns within the lawsuit: first, whether Ethereum received preferential treatment from the SEC, and second, if individuals linked to Ethereum influenced the SEC’s decision against XRP. Hoskinson called for concrete evidence regarding the latter claim, emphasizing the necessity of a “smoking gun” to substantiate such allegations. He maintained his stance that XRP is not a security and noted his consistent belief in this over the years. He also rooted for XRP to win. 
This is the great irony of conspiratorial thinking. It's spreads to every thought and association like a disease. I left Ethereum in June of 2014. The books written about it definitely are not polite. Yet suddenly I'm involved with things that happened years later during my… https://t.co/phXCXDJ0Yq pic.twitter.com/xeTyyodWHu
Plus, he strongly opposes corruption and manipulating government policies. However, the Bitcoin mogul claims no evidence of corruption, including texts, images, or videos.
Despite his support for XRP, Hoskinson’s relationship with the XRP community has been marked by occasional disagreements. He playfully engaged with the community about their ETHGate theories, prompting some to speculate about his involvement. However, Hoskinson dismissed the conspiracy hypothesis, underlining his departure from Ethereum in 2014 and his lack of influence on decisions regarding Ethereum’s regulatory status. According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, conspiracy ideas are unfounded but highlight several SEC executives’ actions.
Ripple CTO slams Charles Hoskinson over SEC’s ETH ‘favoritism’
The future of XRP hangs in the balance. Maintaining a position above $0.473 could pave the way for an upward surge, potentially influencing traders and investors. However, a drop below this critical support level may trigger sell-offs and introduce fresh challenges for the cryptocurrency. The stakes are high for XRP’s next moves.

On the flip side, Hoskinson has tried all the means to settle his scores with the XRP community, and with this support, will it avert the storm of reactions from XRP fans? Let’s take a look. 
Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson has significantly intervened in the ongoing XRP lawsuit, asserting that XRP should not be categorized as a security. Hoskinson addressed two pivotal concerns within the lawsuit: first, whether Ethereum received preferential treatment from the SEC, and second, if individuals linked to Ethereum influenced the SEC’s decision against XRP. Hoskinson called for concrete evidence regarding the latter claim, emphasizing the necessity of a “smoking gun” to substantiate such allegations. He maintained his stance that XRP is not a security and noted his consistent belief in this over the years. He also rooted for XRP to win. 
This is the great irony of conspiratorial thinking. It's spreads to every thought and association like a disease. I left Ethereum in June of 2014. The books written about it definitely are not polite. Yet suddenly I'm involved with things that happened years later during my… https://t.co/phXCXDJ0Yq pic.twitter.com/xeTyyodWHu
Plus, he strongly opposes corruption and manipulating government policies. However, the Bitcoin mogul claims no evidence of corruption, including texts, images, or videos.
Despite his support for XRP, Hoskinson’s relationship with the XRP community has been marked by occasional disagreements. He playfully engaged with the community about their ETHGate theories, prompting some to speculate about his involvement. However, Hoskinson dismissed the conspiracy hypothesis, underlining his departure from Ethereum in 2014 and his lack of influence on decisions regarding Ethereum’s regulatory status. According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, conspiracy ideas are unfounded but highlight several SEC executives’ actions.
Ripple CTO slams Charles Hoskinson over SEC’s ETH ‘favoritism’
The future of XRP hangs in the balance. Maintaining a position above $0.473 could pave the way for an upward surge, potentially influencing traders and investors. However, a drop below this critical support level may trigger sell-offs and introduce fresh challenges for the cryptocurrency. The stakes are high for XRP’s next moves.

U.S. Treasury sanctions Gaza-based crypto broker alleged to have facilitated $25 million in crypto transactions since 2015;"The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has sanctioned  Gaza-based crypto broker “Buy Cash Money and Money Transfer Company (Buy Cash)” and its operator, Ahmed M. M. Alaqad, for facilitating crypto transactions for Hamas, according to an Oct. 18 statement.
Buy Cash is a Gaza-based business that provides money transfer and cryptocurrency exchange services, including Bitcoin (BTC) and other assets, that has had ties to several terrorist groups since 2017.
The company’s domain, registered in July 2015, is linked to Alaqad, who serves as its representative and the proprietor of the financial exchange.
In 2021, Israel’s National Bureau for Counter-Terrorist Financing (NBCTF) seized a crypto wallet associated with Buy Cash, which Hamas had employed for fundraising purposes. This action followed a 2019 Bitcoin transaction traced back to Al-Qa’ida-related groups and a Buy Cash wallet. Furthermore, in 2017, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) utilized Buy Cash wallets to acquire specific online resources.
Data from the blockchain analytical platform Arkham Intelligence showed that the brokerage’s sanctioned BTC wallet “19D1iGzDr” held only $16 worth of assets as of press time, and its last transaction was in May 2022.
Meanwhile, an Elliptic report revealed the existence of additional addresses that the firm has used to facilitate over $25 million in cryptocurrency transactions since 2015.
It should be noted that the regulator also sanctioned five other individuals linked to helping fund Hamas and Palestinian terrorist groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).
The OFAC’s sanctions are part of a broader international effort to restrict Hamas’s financial resources, with various regulatory bodies taking similar actions.
Earlier in the week, stablecoin issuer Tether (USDT) said it froze 32 addresses associated with the conflicts in Israel and Ukraine. The firm reported that approximately $873,118.34 worth of crypto assets were frozen from these addresses.
Additionally, the Israeli police, with support from Binance, have successfully frozen cryptocurrency accounts used by Hamas for fundraising.

Marathon Digital entrusts Bitcoin holdings to Fidelity Digital assets;"Marathon Digital, a prominent player in the Bitcoin mining sector, announced its strategic move to entrust part of its Bitcoin holdings to Fidelity Digital Assets. This decision marks the company’s shift from relying solely on a single custodian to embracing multiple custodial partnerships. The shift aims to enhance the security and management of its substantial cryptocurrency assets.
The firm, holding 13,726 bitcoins as of September 30 and generating over 1,000 more monthly, recognizes the necessity of this step. Consequently, Marathon’s CFO, Salman Khan, highlighted the timing, citing the growing asset base as a primary driver for diversifying Bitcoin custody. This approach not only spreads risk but also underscores the company’s commitment to safeguarding assets against unforeseen circumstances.
Recent incidents in the crypto custody space underscore the importance of Marathon’s move. Various custodians, including Fortress Trust, suffered security breaches, leading to significant digital asset losses. These events have urged companies to reassess their strategies, with Marathon Digital taking proactive measures.
Introducing Fidelity as a custody partner is part of Marathon’s broader treasury management strategy. However, the company’s diversification efforts will continue further. Plans to potentially onboard additional custodians are on the horizon, confirming its dedication to robust, secure, and multifaceted asset management strategies.
This development within Marathon demonstrates a mature approach to asset management in the volatile crypto market. Moreover, it reflects a growing trend among corporations holding significant digital assets to seek advanced security measures. As the digital asset landscape expands, enhanced asset protection becomes increasingly paramount.
By engaging Fidelity Digital Assets, Marathon amplifies its operational security while setting a precedent for other firms in the cryptocurrency sphere. The move also signifies trust in Fidelity’s custody solutions, projecting confidence that could influence industry standards.

Here’s What Tesla Did With its Bitcoin Holdings in Q3 2023;"Tesla’s Q3 2023 financial report reveals that the company did not trade or sell any Bitcoin during the last three months.
As of Sept. 30, Tesla still possesses around 9,720 BTC, valued at approximately $275.6 million based on current market rates.
According to Tesla’s recently released Q3 2023 financial report, the electric vehicle manufacturer did not engage in any Bitcoin buying or selling activities over the past three months.
As of Sept. 30, Tesla still held around 9,720 BTC, valued at approximately $275.6 million at current market prices. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter that Tesla has maintained its Bitcoin holdings without making any changes.
Meanwhile, Tesla’s stock faced a 4.78% decline after the market closed today, with shares valued at $242.68 each. In addition to the information about Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings, the company reported revenue of $23.35 billion for the third quarter, slightly below the estimated $23.9 billion projected by analysts.
Tesla also reported adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share, falling short of the 73 cents per share expected.
Tesla first ventured into cryptocurrency in early 2021 when it invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, as reported in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At that time, the company acquired 43,000 BTC at an estimated price of approximately $34,000 per coin. Simultaneously, Tesla started accepting Bitcoin as a payment option for its vehicles and other products.
However, shortly after this initial investment, concerns arose about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining. CEO Elon Musk expressed reservations about the cryptocurrency and decided to sell 4,320 BTC from Tesla’s holdings. This move coincided with a decline in Bitcoin’s value, resulting in a $101 million impairment loss for the company.
Tesla continued to sell its Bitcoin holdings, and by the second quarter of 2022, it had reportedly disposed of 75% of its holdings. Musk explained that this decision was influenced by uncertainties surrounding the duration of COVID lockdowns in China, and the company needed to bolster its cash reserves. Since then, Tesla has maintained a consistent stance on its Bitcoin holdings, as emphasized by its recently released Q3 2023 report.

Bitcoin stakes claim as 13th largest asset by market cap, nearing half of Silver;"Bitcoin has staked its claim as the 13th largest asset by market cap, evaluated at $555 billion. This places it snugly between Visa, the 14th largest asset with a market capitalization of $499 billion, and Eli Lilly, standing at 12th with a market cap of $585 billion. Notably, yesterday, on Oct. 16, Bitcoin’s market cap briefly spiked to $572 billion.
In comparison with Silver, whose market cap currently stands at $1.284 trillion, making it the seventh-largest asset, Bitcoin’s market cap is approximately 45% of Silver. This comparison substantiates the growing financial weight of Bitcoin in the global asset arena.
Furthermore, the insight into Bitcoin’s dominance within the cryptocurrency market is noteworthy. Currently hovering just below 52%, almost tying its year-to-date high, the Bitcoin dominance percentage validates its continued strength in the crypto market. Intriguingly, this dominance level mirrors that seen in late June, despite Bitcoin’s price being a few thousand dollars less now.

How to Make Intelligent Crypto Investments Using Macroeconomic and Fundamental Analysis;"Embarking on a journey through the intricate world of crypto investments necessitates a multifaceted understanding of various analytical frameworks. With an immense surge in digital currency popularity, ensuring smart and strategic investments in this domain has become paramount. 
In this article, the emphasis will be placed on exploring fundamental analysis (FA) and its adaptation to the crypto domain, illuminating the multitude of metrics and qualitative factors that potential investors should consider before navigating through the vibrant yet volatile crypto market.
Fundamental analysis (FA) serves as a methodology whereby investors ascertain the inherent worth of an asset or company. This is achieved by scrutinizing a variety of internal and external elements with the primary aim of discerning whether the given asset or business entity is priced above or below its actual value. This insight then becomes pivotal for investors to navigate strategically their entry or exit from investments.
Conversely, technical analysis provides valuable trading information but derives distinct insights. Practitioners of technical analysis harbor the belief that future price trajectories can be predicted by scrutinizing an asset’s historical performance. This is achieved through the identification of specific patterns in candlestick charts and the careful examination of key indicators.
Conventional fundamental analysts typically examine business metrics to ascertain what they perceive to be its genuine value. Utilized indicators might encompass earnings per share (a reflection of the profit a company generates per each share available) or the price-to-book ratio (the comparative analysis of how investors value the company against its book value). This analysis might be performed across various businesses within a specific sector to determine how a prospective investment measures against its contemporaries.
Evaluating cryptocurrency networks presents distinct challenges when compared to traditional business assessment due to their unique characteristics. For instance, more decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) bear a resemblance to commodities rather than conventional businesses. Even when considering more centralized digital currencies—those that are issued by specific entities—the conventional indicators of fundamental analysis (FA) offer limited insights.
Hence, it becomes imperative to explore alternative frameworks for analysis. The initial step involves pinpointing robust metrics – those resistant to manipulation. Metrics like X (formerly Twitter) followers or users on Telegram and Reddit might be less reliable as they are susceptible to artificial inflation through the creation of bogus accounts or purchasing engagement on social platforms.
It is crucial to acknowledge that no single metric can furnish a comprehensive view of the network under scrutiny. Even if a notable increase in active blockchain addresses is observed, it doesn’t necessarily provide substantive information. This spike could simply be a single entity, moving funds between new addresses to feign activity.
On-chain metrics, derived from blockchain data, offer a lens through which the activities on a network can be scrutinized. Although acquiring this data independently by running a node and extracting the data for a chosen network is feasible, it often emerges as a resource-intensive and time-consuming endeavor, especially if the sole objective revolves around investment decision-making.
The transaction count serves as a viable indicator of the activity transpiring on a network. Monitoring the number of transactions over designated intervals (or utilizing moving averages) reveals fluctuations in network activity over time. However, caution is warranted in interpreting this metric since the possibility of a single entity transferring funds amongst their own wallets to simulate vibrant on-chain activity cannot be discounted.
Distinct from the transaction count, the transaction value discloses the sum transacted within a stipulated period. For example, if ten Ethereum transactions, each valued at $50, were executed in one day, the daily transaction volume would be declared as $500. This metric can be gauged in a fiat currency like USD or in the protocol’s native unit (ETH).
Active addresses denote blockchain addresses engaged in transactions within a specific timeframe. Methodologies for computing this metric can vary, but a commonly adopted approach entails counting both the sending and receiving entities in each transaction over predetermined intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly). Some analyses also consider the number of unique addresses on an accumulative basis, thereby tracking the cumulative total over a span of time.
Fees paid on a network, while more pertinent to some cryptocurrencies than others, shed light on the demand for block space. This can be envisaged as a bidding process in an auction where users vie against each other to get their transactions included promptly. Higher bidders are likely to have their transactions confirmed sooner, while those bidding lower may experience delays.
For cryptocurrencies following diminishing emission schedules, observing this metric is insightful. Notably, major Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains deliver a block reward, comprised in certain instances of a block subsidy and transaction fees. 
As the block subsidy undergoes periodic reductions (for instance, during Bitcoin halving events) and the cost to mine generally trends upwards over time, transaction fees would logically need to escalate to avoid miners operating at a loss, which could compromise network security.
Given the multitude of consensus algorithms utilized by various blockchains, each with their own inherent mechanisms pivotal for network security, diving into relevant data can be instrumental for fundamental analysis.
In PoW cryptocurrencies, hash rate frequently serves as an indicator of network health. A higher hash rate not only augments the difficulty of successfully executing a 51% attack but also, when trending upwards over time, can hint at escalating interest in mining, likely spurred by reduced overheads and amplified profits. 
Alternatively, a diminishing hash rate indicates miners withdrawing from the network (“miner capitulation”) as it ceases to be economically viable for them.
The overall costs of mining can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including the asset’s current price, transaction volume, and paid fees, among others. Naturally, the direct expenses of mining, such as electricity and computing power, are also vital components to consider.
Conversely, in consensus models like Proof of Stake, staking emerges as a related yet divergently operational concept. Here, users stake their holdings to partake in block validation. Therefore, the quantity staked at any given point could be analyzed to interpret levels of interest or disinterest in participation.
In contrast to on-chain metrics that focus on palpable blockchain data, project metrics undertake a qualitative analysis, examining aspects such as the competency of the team (if one is present), the insights provided by the whitepaper, and the prospective developments outlined in the roadmap.
Investment in any project should be prefaced by a meticulous review of its whitepaper. This technical document provides an encompassing overview of the cryptocurrency project. 
An effectively crafted whitepaper should delineate the network’s objectives and ideally offer insights into:
Vigilant investors would do well to validate this information through cross-referencing with community discussions about the project, scrutinizing for potential red flags, and evaluating the realism of the goals.
Assessing the caliber of the team, if there is one, behind a cryptocurrency network, involves evaluating their track records to ascertain whether they possess the requisite skills to realize the project. 
Questions to consider include: Have team members spearheaded successful initiatives in the sector previously? Do they have the expertise needed to achieve their outlined milestones? Have they been implicated in any dubious projects or scandals in the past?
In the absence of a specific team, investigating the developer community becomes paramount. Checking a public GitHub for the project to gauge the number of contributors and the level of activity can be insightful. A cryptocurrency with consistent development activity might be more attractive than one with a stagnant repository.
An effective whitepaper should also elucidate the use case targeted by the cryptocurrency asset, allowing for the identification of competing projects as well as the legacy infrastructures it intends to supplant.
The fundamental analysis of these competing entities should ideally be equally stringent. While an asset may appear attractive in isolation, applying the same evaluative criteria to analogous crypto assets might expose it as being less robust than its counterparts.
Scrutinizing the tokenomics and the initial distribution framework of a project sheds light on crucial aspects of its potential viability and risk. Sometimes, projects may spawn tokens which, despite the project’s potential, may not have a discernible utility within its context. Therefore, confirming the genuine utility of a token becomes vital. Subsequently, evaluating whether such utility is something that will be acknowledged and valued by the broader market is also crucial.
An additional pivotal aspect to ponder is the methodology of initial fund distribution. Was it orchestrated via an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO), or was it possible for users to mine it? In instances of the former, the whitepaper should delineate the proportion reserved for founders and the team, and the amount made accessible to investors. In instances of the latter, an evaluation might consider evidence of pre-mining by the asset’s creator (mining on the network before public announcement).
Examining the distribution is instrumental in perceiving potential risks. For example, if a predominant majority of the supply is concentrated among a limited number of entities, it might be inferred that this poses a risky investment since those entities might possess the capability to manipulate the market in the future. Such insights are essential to navigating the intricate landscape of cryptocurrency investment, ensuring that decisions are informed and deliberate.
In the fast-advancing ecosystem of cryptocurrency, meticulous scrutiny through fundamental and macroeconomic analysis has emerged as a bedrock for making informed investment decisions. This article embarked on a journey, unfolding the layers of on-chain and project metrics, and exploring the subtle nuances and vital parameters that hold the potential to influence the profitability and sustainability of crypto investments. 
Navigating through the uncharted territories of crypto investing with an informed compass, garnered from a nuanced understanding of underlying metrics and qualitative factors, paves the way for not only safeguarding investments but also contributing to the maturation of the digital asset market.

Embarking on a journey through the intricate world of crypto investments necessitates a multifaceted understanding of various analytical frameworks. With an immense surge in digital currency popularity, ensuring smart and strategic investments in this domain has become paramount. 
In this article, the emphasis will be placed on exploring fundamental analysis (FA) and its adaptation to the crypto domain, illuminating the multitude of metrics and qualitative factors that potential investors should consider before navigating through the vibrant yet volatile crypto market.
Fundamental analysis (FA) serves as a methodology whereby investors ascertain the inherent worth of an asset or company. This is achieved by scrutinizing a variety of internal and external elements with the primary aim of discerning whether the given asset or business entity is priced above or below its actual value. This insight then becomes pivotal for investors to navigate strategically their entry or exit from investments.
Conversely, technical analysis provides valuable trading information but derives distinct insights. Practitioners of technical analysis harbor the belief that future price trajectories can be predicted by scrutinizing an asset’s historical performance. This is achieved through the identification of specific patterns in candlestick charts and the careful examination of key indicators.
Conventional fundamental analysts typically examine business metrics to ascertain what they perceive to be its genuine value. Utilized indicators might encompass earnings per share (a reflection of the profit a company generates per each share available) or the price-to-book ratio (the comparative analysis of how investors value the company against its book value). This analysis might be performed across various businesses within a specific sector to determine how a prospective investment measures against its contemporaries.
Evaluating cryptocurrency networks presents distinct challenges when compared to traditional business assessment due to their unique characteristics. For instance, more decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) bear a resemblance to commodities rather than conventional businesses. Even when considering more centralized digital currencies—those that are issued by specific entities—the conventional indicators of fundamental analysis (FA) offer limited insights.
Hence, it becomes imperative to explore alternative frameworks for analysis. The initial step involves pinpointing robust metrics – those resistant to manipulation. Metrics like X (formerly Twitter) followers or users on Telegram and Reddit might be less reliable as they are susceptible to artificial inflation through the creation of bogus accounts or purchasing engagement on social platforms.

Stablecoins Built on Bitcoin — Lightning Labs Launches Taproot Assets Mainnet Alpha;"Lightning Labs has released the mainnet alpha of its Taproot Assets daemon, advancing the project that seeks to enable stablecoins and other token assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. The software provides developers with tools to begin issuing and managing assets on Bitcoin and integrating them with the layer-two (L2) network.
Although Taproot took some time to gain momentum, its use cases have continued to grow since the integration of Bitcoin-based Ordinal inscriptions and its November 2021 implementation with Bitcoin. The Lightning Labs team has utilized Taproot to develop token assets transferable via Lightning Network payment channels.
Taproot is a Bitcoin protocol upgrade that introduced Schnorr signatures and a new scripting language, Tapscript. These advancements allow for the creation of intricate smart contracts and digital assets on Bitcoin, while also preserving user privacy. The Taproot Assets daemon utilizes Taproot technology to facilitate the issuance of stablecoins and other assets on Bitcoin.
Ordinal inscriptions and BRC20 tokens also employ Taproot for asset creation on Bitcoin. With the mainnet alpha launch, the Taproot Assets protocol will feature full functionality for onchain issuance, redemption, and transfer of BTC-based assets. Developers have the capability to mint new assets, destroy assets they have in custody, and develop apps for end users to send and receive assets using Bitcoin’s blockchain.
Lightning Labs notes that so far, the community’s response to the project has been substantial, with almost 2,000 testnet Taproot assets issued and more than 420,000 test syncs. The team invites stablecoin projects and token developers to contribute to the new release as the protocol nears a production-ready phase.
“With stablecoins integrated into Lightning wallets, users will be able to stack sats with minimal friction as their circumstances allow for it, bringing bitcoin to billions,” Lightning Labs details.
Another prominent feature of this release is the Multiverse mode, which allows one server to host “universes” for several assets simultaneously. Universes are data repositories containing all information necessary for wallets to initiate and synchronize a particular asset. The Multiverse feature will enable developers to construct familiar blockchain explorers for their assets.
The forthcoming major milestone is to allow these assets to be transacted via Bitcoin’s L2 system. When payment channel support is incorporated, global users will have the capability to instantly send and receive stablecoins and other tokens with negligible fees by leveraging Bitcoin’s liquidity and extensive network of nodes.
Following the announcement, several individuals shared their thoughts on Lightning Labs’ release. Bitcoin enthusiast Dan Held commented on X, calling it “huge” and added, “Let the Bitcoin defi flowers bloom.” Another individual expressed reservations about fiat stablecoins, suggesting a gold-pegged stablecoin instead.
Some believe RGB would be a more appropriate technology for stablecoins. RGB is also a platform that facilitates smart contracts and offers a system where users can mint and issue assets on the Bitcoin blockchain with Lightning Network compatibility.
An X account named Hunter Beast remarked to Lightning Labs, “Good for you. Meanwhile, RGB has been on mainnet for months, works with cold wallets instead of being on hackable hot nodes, can do smart contracts, not just assets, and you have no plans to scale beyond Lightning. Taproot Assets will always remain a poor imitator of RGB.”

Binance Traders Go Bearish On Bitcoin, But Here’s Why They Might Regret It;"Observing traders’ decisions about crypto, such as Bitcoin, especially on prominent exchanges like Binance, often holds the key to understanding the underlying currents in the market. Two critical events today, highlighted by renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, paint a curious picture of BTC’s current standing.
Ali Martinez, a respected figure in the crypto analysis world, revealed some interesting data concerning Bitcoin earlier today. According to Martinez’s X (formerly known as Twitter) post, most traders on Binance with open Bitcoin futures seem to expect a downturn.
Specifically, about 51% of these traders are shorting BTC. For clarity, shorting is essentially betting that the price of an asset will decrease. This data indicates that, at least on Binance, traders have a prevailing sentiment that Bitcoin’s price might be due for a dip.
As #Bitcoin nears $29,000, roughly 51% of all accounts on #Binance with an open $BTC futures position are going short! pic.twitter.com/o7SUMfHEyX
— Ali (@ali_charts) October 18, 2023
Yet, it’s important to note that shorting doesn’t necessarily always translate to a lack of confidence in the asset. Traders might be hedging their bets, capitalizing on short-term fluctuations, or employing a range of trading strategies that best suit their financial objectives and risk tolerance.
On the same day, in another tweet, Martinez shared that Bitcoin has achieved a notable milestone. The top cryptocurrency surged past the $27,900 mark, which Martinez identifies as the “short-term holder cost basis.”
 This means that those who have held BTC for a shorter duration and previously saw minimal profits could potentially be realizing gains.
If Bitcoin maintains its position above this crucial price point, it may suggest a shift in market sentiment, swinging more towards the bullish side, according to the analyst.
#Bitcoin has crossed the short-term holder cost basis of around $27,900, which is a crucial psychological benchmark.
If $BTC maintains above this level, those short-term holders previously underwater may be back in profit. This could signal a shift to a bullish market sentiment! pic.twitter.com/WilZ6CB67P
— Ali (@ali_charts) October 18, 2023
This development starkly contrasts the aforementioned shorting trend on Binance, emphasizing the multifaceted and complex dynamics at play in the crypto market. Meanwhile, the global crypto market has slipped by 0.4% in the past 24 hours following BTC’s drop of nearly 1%.
Bitcoin trades for $28,348 after retracing from its recent spike earlier this week to above $30,000 due to a false report of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of spot Bitcoin ETF.

Here’s How Much Bitcoin (BTC) Drake Lost Betting on the Logan Paul v. Dillon Danis Fight;"TL;DR

The American influencer, wrestler, and popular YouTuber – Logan Paul – faced the MMA fighter Dillon Danis over the weekend in a highly-anticipated boxing match. Both men had beef with each other as their fight was supposedly triggered by insults to their respective girlfriends. 
The odds were in favor of Paul, whereas Danis was the underdog. The popular Canadian musician Aubrey Drake Graham, better known by his stage name Drake, tried his luck, betting $850,000 worth of bitcoin on the former to win by a knockout.
Despite being the better fighter in that match, Paul could not secure a KO victory and won by points. Subsequently, the judges disqualified Danis for causing a mass brawl right after the final bell.
As such, Drake, who used the cryptocurrency betting platform Stake to wager his bet, lost the distributed funds. His potential profit would have been half a million dollars in BTC should Paul have knocked out his opponent.
The Canadian rapper seems to be a huge fan of betting on various sports events. Many teams and athletes have suffered a downfall after he put money on them, which prompted the creation of the phrase “the Drake curse.”
In May last year, Drake bet $234,000 worth of BTC on Ferrari’s driver Charles Leclerc to win the Spanish Grand Prix. However, the winner of the race was Max Verstappen.
Several months later, the musician tried his luck in football, wagering $600,000 worth of bitcoin on the English soccer team Arsenal to beat Leeds United and on FC Barcelona to win “El Clasico” against Real Madrid. Unfortunately for Drake, the team from Spain’s capital beat its biggest rival by 3-1.
Earlier this year, the Canadian parted with $400,000 in BTC after Jake Paul (the brother of Logan Paul) lost his fight against Tommy Fury (the half-brother of the world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury).

Wipe Out — Fake SEC Approval Report Erases $71M in Bitcoin Short Positions;"In the wake of fabricated news asserting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lit Blackrock’s Ishares spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, short positions worth $78.92 million were cleared out. This sum represented 57% of the overall $136.29 million in short positions erased in the last 24 hours.
On Monday, the crypto-focused media outlet Cointelegraph disseminated false information via social media platform X and its Telegram channel, triggering a more than 10% spike in bitcoin (BTC) value against the U.S. dollar.
The digital currency briefly touched $29,900 per coin before plunging to $28,100 per unit once the news was debunked. Cointelegraph, despite issuing an apology, was too late to prevent the market upheaval that resulted in the obliteration of $78.92 million worth of short positions.

Data from Coinglass reveals that in the past four hours, BTC short positions accounted for $71.36 million of the liquidated shorts. Around $2.49 million in Solana (SOL) short positions were also liquidated, among others.
The $78.92 million represented a staggering 57% of the day’s total short positions liquidated in the last 24 hours. In the same four-hour timeframe, long positions in Ethereum (ETH) exceeding $18 million were also liquidated.
Following the exposure of the counterfeit news, short positions on Bitfinex dropped drastically. Concurrently, long positions on Bitfinex saw a surge before the false news was confirmed, but have since declined.
The fallacious news event led to a significant number of traders being liquidated, potentially deflating the speculation surrounding the actual decision. The most substantial liquidations came from BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, and SOL.

Binance Quarterly Report Highlights Major Infrastructure Investment;"Binance Research has just released its Q3 report for 2023. “State of Crypto: Market Pulse” provides a snapshot of the blockchain industry as the year prepares to enter its final quarter. There’s been a lot to pack into the last three months of crypto activity but Binance Research does its best to cover it.
One key highlight from the 53-page document is significant investment in blockchain infrastructure projects, but this is tempered by tough market conditions. Total value locked (TVL) into DeFi protocols is down in Q3, as is volume, while the total market capitalization has decreased by 8.6%. There are other positives, though, including positive regulatory news that has raised expectations of Bitcoin ETF approval in the near future.
Binance’s Market Pulse report cuts straight to the chase in detailing the areas where crypto struggled in Q3 2023. The most obvious sign of this is the 8.6% decline in the capitalization of all crypto assets. The fact that Ethereum transaction fees have decreased in Q3 can also be taken as a bearish indicator. So too have those on BNB Chain. But it hasn’t all been bad news: “In Q3, institutional adoption surged even in the face of declining prices, with major companies like Deutsche Bank, Sony, Grab, and PayPal announcing their involvement in web3 initiatives,” we read.
While three-month analysis of a particular industry can reveal short-term trends, sometimes you need to zoom out to see the bigger picture. The State of Crypto: Market Pulse authors acknowledge this, emphasizing that 2023 has still smiled kindly on crypto, with BTC up 63% YTD.
There are some who say the days of crypto VCs writing big checks for blockchain projects are over. The Market Pulse report would disagree. It points out Flashbots’ $60M Series B fundraising and Bitmain’s $54M strategic investment in Core Scientific. It then adds: “Gaming and Metaverse also saw strong interests with Futureverse clinching $54M in funding to develop AI-centric consumer games,” and notes Animoca Brands’ $20M raise for its Mocaverse project.
While VCs continue to cautiously seek out web3 projects with a clear pathway to profitability, another sector that has been ticking over nicely this quarter is Ethereum staking. It remains in rude health; 20% of all ETH in circulation has now been staked, the report notes, with LSTfi taking credit for much of this uptick in staking activity. Lido remains the market leader for ETH liquid staking.
NFTs have been on life support for months, as evidenced by their low trading volume and general industry apathy. Despite there being multiple predictions of NFTs’ demise in Q3, crypto tokens empirically have a habit of rallying when everyone’s written them off. There’s been a lot of money sunk into NFT projects, and it’s hard to believe that none of them will yield dividends, especially with the likes of Yuga Labs and Animoca Brands busily working away.
As the NFT space deals with its demons, web3 gaming has been enjoying greater fortunes. BNB Chain now hosts the highest number of onchain games, the State of Crypto report reveals, followed by Ethereum and Polygon. But GameFi’s full potential has yet to be realized: only 28% of web3 games are live, most remaining in their alpha or beta phase.
Despite a choppy couple of months on the markets, the Binance Research report shows there’s still reasons to feel confident about where crypto is headed next.

BlackRock Amends Bitcoin ETF Prospectus, BTC Prices Rise: Are Bulls Getting Started?;"BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has amended its prospectus for the spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) with the stringent United States Securities and Exchange (SEC), according to a report on October 18. 
Specific changes made on their iShares Bitcoin Trust submitted by the asset manager include acknowledging the intense competition in the race for approval. The applicant said there was no assurance that their product would find instant market acceptance and scale due to competition should it be endorsed. They also explained its pricing structure and reporting mechanism.
Changes to its prospectus come roughly a month after BlackRock re-submitted its application in July 2023. Then, the applicant divulged the monitoring agreement they had sealed with Nasdaq and Coinbase Custody. BlackRock now joins Ark Invest and Fidelity, who also had to make changes for clarity.
As it is, Fidelity is the other notable applicant. The financial institution has been pro-Bitcoin over the years. In 2020, Fidelity added the option for corporate clients to invest in Bitcoin through their 401(k) retirement plans. 
This year, Fidelity introduced a Bitcoin trading platform for individual investors. In June 2023, Fidelity refiled paperwork with the SEC for its Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust. However, Fidelity also had to revise its application, stating the risks associated with the complex Bitcoin derivative product.
The crypto community is upbeat and expects the SEC to approve multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications submitted by the top brass in traditional finance in the next few months, probably in 2024. However, the exact timing remains tentative, a cause of anxiety in the community. 
A spot Bitcoin ETF will directly track Bitcoin prices, allowing investors to trade its listed shares on a regulated exchange. Subsequently, this would make it much easier for clients, especially institutions, to gain exposure to Bitcoin without necessarily buying and storing coins. A former BlackRock executive predicted the Bitcoin market to attract at least $150 billion in three years once the SEC authorizes one or several products.
On October 19, Bitcoin prices briefly rallied above $28,500, aligning with gains of October 16. Still, whether the spike could be tied to BlackRock amending its prospectus or the general optimism in the broader crypto and Bitcoin community is unclear. 
The false news of the SEC approving the first Bitcoin ETF early this week forced prices higher. The coin soared above $30,000 at its peaks before cooling off to spot rates.

Realistic Bitcoin Price Prediction for the Next BTC Bull Run;"TL;DR
Bitcoin bulls are currently awaiting several advancements that could potentially trigger a price surge for the primary cryptocurrency. Such factors might be regulatory developments, the upcoming halving, positive market sentiment, increasing interest from institutional investors, and others. 
Some prominent names, including MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, have laid out extremely bullish forecasts, envisioning BTC to reach the $1 million mark in the future. Others, like the technical analyst using the X handle CryptoCon, have been more modest.
In a recent post on the social media, they predicted that BTC seems poised for a spike to approximately $138,000 by the end of 2025. The chart depicting the possible trajectory outlines some vital support levels the asset needs to overcome and the halving, scheduled for the spring of 2024.
The latter is an event that occurs every four years and reduces the rewards for BTC miners in half. It is worth mentioning that the valuation of the leading cryptocurrency hit an ATH of almost $70K a year and a half after the latest halving.
CryptoCon has previously suggested that Bitcoin’s new peak by Christmas 2025 could be in the range of $145,000, claiming that numerous other expert predictions point out to a price of approximately $130,000 in the next bull run.
Multiple finance experts and cryptocurrency advocates have backed the thesis that BTC will eventually exceed the coveted level of $100,000. Such examples are Robert Kiyosaki (the author of the best-seller Rich Dad, Poor Dad), Adam Back (CEO of Blockstream), Tom Lee (Managing Partner at Fundstrat), Anthony Scaramucci (former White House official), and many others. 

Most recently, Max Keiser – American filmmaker and Chairman of El Salvador-based Bitcoin mining startup Volcano Energy – forecasted that the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could jump to $220,000. According to him, the driving factors of that surge might be “social unrest” and “societal breakdown.”
Recall that previous global catastrophes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, propelled a rising interest in crypto, specifically BTC. The asset was a subject of mass adoption after individuals viewed it as a hedge against inflation and a somewhat alternative to the devaluating fiat currencies.

The crypto winter thaws: Morgan Stanley Wealth Management weighs in;"Based on the crypto market price fluctuations, enthusiasts and skeptics alike have been closely monitoring the market’s volatility and the end of the most prolonged crypto winter. The crypto market has experienced several booms and crashes, and this period of turbulence has been termed the crypto winter. 
The red market that has been witnessed since late last year is almost over, according to insights from Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. 
The crypto winter covering the bearish market may be thawing. This can be attributed to several factors that affect the digital currency market. Bitcoin’s price may have bottomed out, indicating an end to its bearish trend. A bull run is expected to inflate the entire crypto market, reaching new heights in the coming future. 
Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is the US asset management unit for the Morgan Stanley US-based bank. The organization has recently posted a report that focuses on the possibility of an end to the crypto winter market. The end of the bearish market could ignite an uptrend for digital currencies, especially Bitcoin.
According to the Morgan Stanley Wealth Management firm, “Current data indicates a high probability of the end of the crypto winter and the imminent arrival of the crypto spring.” The post on Tuesday recorded, “Based on current data, signs indicate that crypto winter may be in the past and that crypto spring is likely on the horizon.”
The organization analyzed data from the previous Bitcoin winters, concluding its price reaches its bottom level after a peak within 12 to 24 months. Bitcoin reached its peak in November 2021, valued at $69,000, and later hit its bottom support in November 2022, a year later. 
A strategy at the Morgan Stanley organization explained how the bearish market would come to an end, basing his comments on previous market data. Denny Galindo, the organization’s strategist, commented, “A price increase of over 50% in Bitcoin is usually an indication that the bottom has been reached.” 
According to his analysis, the largest crypto has experienced a rise of over 70% since the start of the first quarter this year and 77% since its previous bottom last year. The bottom recorded about $16,000 in November 2022. 
Galindo also noted that the previous price troughs based on Bitcoin’s drawdowns were about 83%
According to Galindo, most of Bitcoin’s gains come immediately after block rewards obtained from its 4-year halving. The bullish market begins with the bitcoin block halving event with its rewards and later ends as the BTC reaches its previous peak. 
The halving after every four years awards miners for successful Bitcoin block mining and the rewards are reduced by half after every halving event. As such, Bitcoin’s inflation is controlled and reduces the pressure on the digital currency. The next halving event is set for 6 months from now, in 2024. 
Galindo further explained, “The scarcity created by restricting the supply of Bitcoin can affect its price and potentially trigger a bull market.”  He elaborated that the previous three halving events have influenced the bull market since Bitcoin’s inception. The spikes and fluctuations occur after every block reward halving, with a timeline between 12 to 18 months. 
Based on the report by Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, the end of the crypto winter might be fostered by institutional adoption, growing regulatory clarity, crypto’s evolving use case, and the growing market cap. 
The report suggests that the crypto market has journeyed from its initial hype-driven phase toward a utility-focused phase. As the adoption of crypto grows, the digital currency market is set to face a bull run, ending the crypto winter.

Bitcoin Dominance Rises: Why Altcoin Buying May Need A Break;"In a recent trend evident on crypto charts, Bitcoin dominance is once again on the rise, prompting some traders and investors to rethink their strategies concerning altcoins. An in-depth analysis of the data, coupled with insights from prominent crypto analysts, unveils several compelling reasons to exercise caution when considering an altcoin purchase at this moment.
Bitcoin’s market dominance – its market cap relative to the entire cryptocurrency market – has historically been a leading indicator of market sentiment. If Bitcoin dominance is increasing, it means that sentiment toward altcoins is waning.
In an analysis today, renowned analyst Rekt Capital has warned of this flashing signal, he shared the following chart and tweeted:
BTC Dominance has left the “retest zone”. Now in the process of entering an uptrend continuation which could see BTC Dominance revisit the 58% mark for the first time in years.
Over the past five months, the Bitcoin dominance saw a consolidation within the ‘retest zone’ after it saw a 10%+ rise since the beginning of the year. BTC dominance pulled back as part of its retest which enabled altcoins to gain some momentum for a short period of time. But, like in mid-2018, BTC is now breaking above the resistance zone, suggesting that 58% could be the next target. Notably, BTC dominance peaked above 71% during the last run in 2021.
When Bitcoin’s dominance rises, it often corresponds to reduced liquidity in the altcoin market. Reduced liquidity can lead to heightened volatility, with price swings potentially wiping out significant portions of invested capital. For investors with a risk-averse profile, such conditions might not be ideal.
Moreover, recent interest appears to be concentrated primarily on Bitcoin. In times of capitulation and boredom, investors often seek the security and liquidity provided by Bitcoin over altcoins. A driving factor for this is that potential catalysts for the crypto market are Bitcoin-specific, like the halving and the potential approval of a spot ETF. As these events play out, Bitcoin will probably continue to outshine altcoins.
Joshua Lim, the former head of derivatives at Genesis Trading and former head of trading strategy at Galaxy Digital, recently weighed in on the ongoing tussle between Bitcoin and Ethereum. “ETH/BTC spot ratio is a major battleground right now,” Lim noted, adding that the rally in BTC/USD was effectively suppressing Ethereum. He highlighted a significant skew in options volume favoring Bitcoin over Ethereum, emphasizing Ethereum’s diminishing allocator interest (options volume skewed 5:1 towards BTC).
Meanwhile, Miles Deutscher, a well-regarded crypto analyst, offered a condensed perspective on the prevailing market sentiment. “We’re in the most difficult market phase… where time capitulation really starts to set in,” Deutscher remarked. He further cautioned retail participants who have been distancing themselves from the market, suggesting that this might be an inopportune moment to do so.
Deutscher added, “Accept that BTC is likely to lead in the early stages of the bull run… it’s not wise to fade BTC during this period.” He recommended a “top-down approach to the market,” emphasizing a strategy that starts with the foundational assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, before exploring other altcoins.
At press time, BTC traded at $28,585.

Wait For Bitcoin At $20,000? This Analyst Says No;"An analyst has explained using on-chain data that Bitcoin has a major demand bucket at the current price levels, so it won’t hit $20,000 anytime soon.
In a new post on X, analyst Ali has explained that some large entities accumulated at the $25,000 to $30,000 range. The indicator of interest here is the “UTXO Realized Price Distribution” (URPD), which, in short, tells us about the amount of Bitcoin that was acquired at the different price levels of the cryptocurrency.
Here is a chart that shows how the URPD of the current Bitcoin market looks like:

Notice that the URPD here is “ATH-partitioned.” What this means is that the price ranges here have been defined by creating 100 equally spaced partitions between zero and the all-time high (ATH) of the cryptocurrency.
From the graph of the Bitcoin URPD, it’s visible that the price levels between $25,000 and $30,000 are host to the cost basis of a particularly large amount of the supply.
Ali notes that most people, including major institutional investors like Michael Saylor’s Microstrategy and Elon Musk’s Tesla, purchased a significant number of coins between these levels.
The levels being so dense with supply isn’t only significant because of the fact that these large entities believe those prices were worthy buys, but also due to how investor psychology tends to work out.
Generally, whenever the price retests the cost basis of a holder, they may become more probable to show some reaction. How they would react depends on their sentiment and profit/loss status prior to the retest.
If they had been i9n profits before the price declined towards their cost basis, they may believe the price would go up again in the future so they would accumulate more at the dip.
On the other hand, them being at loss before may make them sell at their cost basis, as they would find the idea of breaking-even more enticing than potentially going back into losses.
There are some dense price buckets above the current level, meaning that BTC could feel resistance when it would retest them due to such investors exiting at their break-even.
If Bitcoin declines instead, however, it could feel strong support, as the buckets below are zones of some pretty major demand, so at least some of these investors might be inclined to buy more at these same levels. Thus, a decline below this range could be unlikely for the cryptocurrency.
“So when they tell you “It’s too late to buy BTC” or “Wait for $20k,” please ignore them!”, advises the analyst.
Bitcoin is up almost 7% during the past week, but the coin’s surge has slowed down recently as its price has mostly been consolidating around $28,500.

Trek Through the Titans BNB and Ethereum with Bitcoin Spark’s Brilliant Blueprint;"With leading cryptocurrencies like BNB and Ethereum currently facing challenges, market watchers suggest investors can trek through the titans with Bitcoin Spark’s brilliant blueprint.
The Binance Coin (BNB) price has struggled to move away from its support just above $200. Additionally, both volume and momentum indicators display weakness and bearish tendencies in the daily timeframe.
The daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has also displayed a bearish cross, solidifying the prevailing sentiment that sellers hold sway in the current BNB market. Analysts foresee the possibility of another test of the key support at $206. They suggest if this support breaks, BNB’s price might plummet further towards the $180 level.
The Ethereum (ETH) price failed to stay above the $1,665 level and has moved into a bearish zone, trading below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
Analysts suggest if the Ethereum price fails to clear the $1,665 resistance, it could continue to move down, with the initial support near the $1,620 level and the next at $1,600. There’s also a palpable concern that a breach below the $1,600 support may unleash a strong bearish wave, potentially driving Ether’s price below the $1,585 threshold.
Bitcoin Spark is a groundbreaking blockchain on a mission to surmount the limitations of its predecessors and inaugurate a new era of cryptocurrency transactions. It’s rooted in the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and thus shares a notable similarity with Bitcoin (BTC), having a maximum supply of 21 million BTCS coins. However, Bitcoin Spark has a more impressive technical architecture. It has a short block time, high transactional capacity per block, and a massive number of nodes, delivering faster and more cost-effective transactions.
Moreover, Bitcoin Spark features multiple layers, with a dedicated smart contract layer that includes separate execution systems, all of which reach finality on the primary network. This layered approach fosters a highly scalable ecosystem, which enables developers to leverage an array of high-level and low-level programming languages. Bitcoin Spark thus primes itself as a robust platform for diverse smart contracts and decentralized applications (Dapps).

Perhaps the most revolutionary feature of Bitcoin Spark is its Proof-of-Process (PoP) consensus mechanism. Departing from conventional crypto mining practices, the PoP non-linearly rewards miners for confirming blocks and contributing their processing power to the network. The nonlinear approach, coupled with the vast nodes, makes BTCS mining accessible and profitable even for individuals with low-powered devices. The Bitcoin Spark team is set to introduce a user-friendly mining application compatible with popular operating systems, including iOS, Android, and Windows, further democratizing the mining process.
Bitcoin Spark’s innovative vision extends beyond mining; it plans to lease the contributed power to individuals and organizations in need of remote computing resources, who will be required to pay for the service in BTCS. Moreover, the network will incorporate unobtrusive advertising slots on its application and website, subject to community oversight to ensure compliance with terms and conditions. Advertisers will remit payments in BTCS, with network participants poised to receive 50% of the generated revenue, along with additional incentives for overseeing the advertisements.
Notably, the BTCS mining rewards will run on an elastic system that factors the revenue generated within the Bitcoin Spark network. If more revenue is generated, the minting is reduced proportionally, moving the endpoint further. Thus, the ability for unlimited processing power provision, coupled with the booming marketing industry, suggests the network’s participants will remain consistently profitable despite market fluctuations.
Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) is currently selling at $3.00 with a 7% bonus in Phase 7 of its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) but will launch on November 30th at $10. Analysts suggest the combination of favorable market conditions upon launch, technological innovation, and token scarcity positions Bitcoin Spark as a promising candidate for significant price growth.

The Second Coming of AI Crypto: This Time We Have Memes;"The post The Second Coming of AI Crypto: This Time We Have Memes appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
In this blog, you’ll learn:
2023 will go down as the year AI went mainstream. Whether it was on LinkedIn or your local bar, in Q1, it felt like you were never more than two meters from a conversation about ChatGPT. 
This hasn’t come out of nowhere, though. Plenty of industries have been embracing AI more and more over the past decade. Chatbots and customer service are now inseparable. As are the education sector and plagiarism detection software. Advanced algorithms and predictive maintenance help to minimize equipment downtime and poor product quality. And HR software now uses AI to review resumes. 
AI was, and still is, the sexy new tech in town. And this has come at the expense of crypto. The investment was diverted. And the AI crypto market had lost $730 million by the start of Q2. Even Elon was trolling accordingly.
But as you’ll come to understand below, this supposed rough patch for AI crypto is a) temporary and b) irrelevant. Because there are too many good ideas to keep down. From impressive AI crypto projects to promising AI crypto coins. 
Plus, there’s every reason to expect that these market moves will be similar to anything else in the crypto space; so much of what goes down almost inevitably goes back up. As we’ll see below, a significant driver of this is simply a case of giving investors enough time to appreciate the true utility of certain projects. And since people are already taking advantage of AI crypto’s use cases – namely via the projects outlined below – this crypto bounceback seems extra likely to touch the AI crypto industry.     
If all AI crypto projects were just lazy and shameless examples of jumping on a bandwagon, then we may have cause for concern. No doubt such examples exist. But there are more than enough crypto AI projects promising real utility. And, as AI advances, it simultaneously elevates any potential these projects have; AI’s success = AI crypto’s success.
This was to be expected. High-frequency trading has been a feature of traditional finance for years. So with the advent of AI, this additional improvement on human trading capabilities is a no-brainer.
There are several examples of AI trading projects that continue to grow and defy the decreasing trend of AI crypto. Altrady is claiming to be the “world’s most powerful crypto trading platform”. It offers the ability to trade across multiple exchanges, and with its advanced bots, you can improve both the quality and quantity of your trades. Kryll allows for much of the same. However, it also offers a Marketplace where users can rent bots that have been submitted by other users. This can be a great place for any newcomers to get started. 3Commas is another platform that could appeal to beginners. It has bots designed for bull, bear, and sideways markets. Many of these platforms also have their own tokens.
Then, sitting alongside these platforms, are AI insight platforms. Tools like CoinScreener are enabling users to make better decisions by offering advanced insights and trading signals. And again, as with the trading platforms, many of these insight platforms are doing their own ICOs.
This project has given itself a hefty goal. In their words:
“Our core mission is the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for a beneficial technological Singularity.”
For those needing a quick recap/explanation, AGI is the hypothetical, multi-faceted type of intelligence that will be greater or equal to that of a human brain. And this technological Singularity is the term for the point at which AI either gains self-awareness or becomes so advanced that we can’t control it. Whilst that may sound scary, bear in mind that since their goal is for this Singularity to be beneficial, SingularityNET is fighting the good fight, trying to ensure the (probably inevitable) robot revolution is a help, not a hindrance.  
Supporting this goal is Singularity’s program for incubating promising AI projects. These are spread across a range of industries such as Robotics, Biotech, DeFi, Enterprise-level AI, and others.
Complementing these bold ambitions is another endeavour: its decentralized AI marketplace. Here, SingularityNET is aiming to set AI amongst the people – or rather, any developers looking to go further into AI. On the marketplace are 80+ AI tools, submitted by a range of developers, with most of the tools offering demo capabilities. These tools range from fun and simple to more complex and useful. They include:
Powering the SingularityNET is the AGIX utility token. This serves as a payment method for any marketplace transactions and as a tool for staking and governance in the AGIX community. 
SingularityNet has been a champion of AI and crypto from the very start, having been around long before anyone had heard of ChatGPT. It serves as a reminder that AI can benefit from blockchain and crypto, just as much as crypto can benefit from AI. And when we combine the two industries, everyone, from investors to humanity, can benefit. 
The Fetch.ai platform allows you to utilize AI agents. These are AIs that can autonomously act on your/your business’s behalf to complete a range of tasks. These include price bidding on assets and commodities, searching and booking airline flights, optimizing resources within large systems like, say, a smart city, and more. AI agents are essentially multi-purpose efficiency boosters that can act as additional digital team members. 
Since they utilize machine learning, they can change their behaviour over time, continuously increasing their efficiency. These agents are easy to integrate; in Fetch’s words you can “wrap your API in a Fetch.ai Agent in minutes, without changing your underlying business application.” 
Fetch.ai’s native token is the FET. Not only does it allow users to put their agents to work, but it also serves as both a governance and staking token. Here’s a full breakdown of the utility FET offers.
Looking at all this new AI technology, it’s plausible that we’re not far off from a future where there’s an AI tool for just about every human need. And with that, a respective cryptocurrency. This means the rising tide of technology should lift all boats, boost AI even further, and usher in a second coming of AI crypto. Plus, we haven’t even gotten started on the meme coins – more on those later…
As we can see, January was a good month for AI crypto. But the hype was anything but sustained.
AI tokens trade volume – 2023
This is to be expected, though. The mood around crypto can be particularly fickle. AI crypto coins shouldn’t be any different. More to the point, countless successful technologies have met similar fates on their way to the top. As reflected by the perpetually relevant Gartner hype cycle. 
Couple this with the fact that we’re still very much in the midst of a crypto bear market, and faith in both AI crypto projects and new AI technology need not be called into question. There’s every reason to believe that the tables are about to turn, leading us firmly towards a bull market in the not-so-distant future. 
A recent report from Bitget anticipates a resurgence in AI crypto. A lot of this hinges on there being notable breakthroughs in AI. This is hardly something to lack faith in. The prevailing attitude around AI domination seems to be more a case of when, not if.
A wave of such breakthroughs could already be at our doorstep. In mid-August, a collaboration between Fetch.ai and data-sharing platform Ocean launched a new data exchange system that preserves privacy for the user. And the presale for the yPredict coin, powering “the world’s most advanced crypto research platform” is going from strength to strength. 
If we also zoom out and consider the cryptosphere as a whole, it wouldn’t be foolish to believe we’re due another bull run shortly. The halving is approaching, and historically, this has marked the beginning of an upward trajectory.  
Meme coins have had their fifteen minutes of fame on more than one occasion. We’ve had Elon sending Doge to the moon, and 2023’s meme coin mania made plenty of investors happy. Yes, meme coins aren’t exactly pumping right now. But we can remain confident that an AI meme coin bull run is just around the corner. Here’s why.
Anyone who thinks meme coins are dead is misguided. Doge, Shiba Inu, etc., are still front of house on sites like CoinMarketCap. And while the traditional finance world dismisses these coins, a loyal and engaged community lives on. A community that actually understands internet culture and appreciates the fun these coins bring.
Also, Elon Musk can’t be ignored. He continues to pump Doge. Which, in turn, influences other meme coin prices. And for the average investor, he is a much more relatable voice than any of the naysayers in the world of TradFi.
Thirdly, meme coins are the ultimate speculative investment. They’ve created millionaires thanks to their crazy price swings. So for the retail investor who felt like they got into Bitcoin a little too late, they’re always going to look appealing.
This is the party that is just about to get started. Think about it. Everything is in place. It’s full steam ahead on the AI train. As discussed, there’s plenty of reason to believe that the next crypto bull run is on the horizon. And, most importantly, there are some neat meme coin AI projects already bubbling up. Whether it’s the Shibot AI virtual pet, or the ARBDOGE token, AI meme coins are offering loads of untapped potential, fun, and most importantly, gains.
Just as we have seen, meme coins are continuing to pique investors’ interest. One of those that has arrived recently is a particularly fun one that has caught the eye of discerning crypto investors. Sent from the year 2077 Memeinator combines ‘90s action movie branding with a killer sales pitch; destroy all weak meme coins. The Memeinator is on a laser-focused war against the legions of worthless meme coins it sees taking up space in people’s bags. It already has a vibrant community of over 20k Twitter followers and is planning on reaching a $1 billion market cap.
Most importantly, though, it has plans for an AI-powered game: Meme Warfare. Playing as the Memeinator, you will stomp through a virtual wasteland, obliterating weak meme coins. With the help of AI, the coins featured in the game will be a real-time reflection of their performance in the market; if Pepe is underperforming, he will be firmly within Memeinator’s crosshairs. 
AI and crypto are too promising to keep down. And meme coins are too exciting and loved to ignore. It’s very hard to say how the next few months will pan out in the cryptosphere. But when it comes to investing, betting on quality technologies and engaged, committed communities has often been a solid tactic. 
If you’re in this game to make exponential profits, then the AI meme coin space is definitely worth paying attention to. With projects like Memeinator just about to kick off, now is the time to take advantage of the second coming that TradFi money doesn’t see coming. 
Bring your wallet and your memes. It’s going to be quite the ride.

But as you’ll come to understand below, this supposed rough patch for AI crypto is a) temporary and b) irrelevant. Because there are too many good ideas to keep down. From impressive AI crypto projects to promising AI crypto coins. 
Plus, there’s every reason to expect that these market moves will be similar to anything else in the crypto space; so much of what goes down almost inevitably goes back up. As we’ll see below, a significant driver of this is simply a case of giving investors enough time to appreciate the true utility of certain projects. And since people are already taking advantage of AI crypto’s use cases – namely via the projects outlined below – this crypto bounceback seems extra likely to touch the AI crypto industry.     
If all AI crypto projects were just lazy and shameless examples of jumping on a bandwagon, then we may have cause for concern. No doubt such examples exist. But there are more than enough crypto AI projects promising real utility. And, as AI advances, it simultaneously elevates any potential these projects have; AI’s success = AI crypto’s success.
This was to be expected. High-frequency trading has been a feature of traditional finance for years. So with the advent of AI, this additional improvement on human trading capabilities is a no-brainer.
There are several examples of AI trading projects that continue to grow and defy the decreasing trend of AI crypto. Altrady is claiming to be the “world’s most powerful crypto trading platform”. It offers the ability to trade across multiple exchanges, and with its advanced bots, you can improve both the quality and quantity of your trades. Kryll allows for much of the same. However, it also offers a Marketplace where users can rent bots that have been submitted by other users. This can be a great place for any newcomers to get started. 3Commas is another platform that could appeal to beginners. It has bots designed for bull, bear, and sideways markets. Many of these platforms also have their own tokens.
Then, sitting alongside these platforms, are AI insight platforms. Tools like CoinScreener are enabling users to make better decisions by offering advanced insights and trading signals. And again, as with the trading platforms, many of these insight platforms are doing their own ICOs.
This project has given itself a hefty goal. In their words:
“Our core mission is the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for a beneficial technological Singularity.”
For those needing a quick recap/explanation, AGI is the hypothetical, multi-faceted type of intelligence that will be greater or equal to that of a human brain. And this technological Singularity is the term for the point at which AI either gains self-awareness or becomes so advanced that we can’t control it. Whilst that may sound scary, bear in mind that since their goal is for this Singularity to be beneficial, SingularityNET is fighting the good fight, trying to ensure the (probably inevitable) robot revolution is a help, not a hindrance.  
Supporting this goal is Singularity’s program for incubating promising AI projects. These are spread across a range of industries such as Robotics, Biotech, DeFi, Enterprise-level AI, and others.
Complementing these bold ambitions is another endeavour: its decentralized AI marketplace. Here, SingularityNET is aiming to set AI amongst the people – or rather, any developers looking to go further into AI. On the marketplace are 80+ AI tools, submitted by a range of developers, with most of the tools offering demo capabilities. These tools range from fun and simple to more complex and useful. They include:
Powering the SingularityNET is the AGIX utility token. This serves as a payment method for any marketplace transactions and as a tool for staking and governance in the AGIX community. 
SingularityNet has been a champion of AI and crypto from the very start, having been around long before anyone had heard of ChatGPT. It serves as a reminder that AI can benefit from blockchain and crypto, just as much as crypto can benefit from AI. And when we combine the two industries, everyone, from investors to humanity, can benefit. 
The Fetch.ai platform allows you to utilize AI agents. These are AIs that can autonomously act on your/your business’s behalf to complete a range of tasks. These include price bidding on assets and commodities, searching and booking airline flights, optimizing resources within large systems like, say, a smart city, and more. AI agents are essentially multi-purpose efficiency boosters that can act as additional digital team members. 
Since they utilize machine learning, they can change their behaviour over time, continuously increasing their efficiency. These agents are easy to integrate; in Fetch’s words you can “wrap your API in a Fetch.ai Agent in minutes, without changing your underlying business application.” 
Fetch.ai’s native token is the FET. Not only does it allow users to put their agents to work, but it also serves as both a governance and staking token. Here’s a full breakdown of the utility FET offers.
Looking at all this new AI technology, it’s plausible that we’re not far off from a future where there’s an AI tool for just about every human need. And with that, a respective cryptocurrency. This means the rising tide of technology should lift all boats, boost AI even further, and usher in a second coming of AI crypto. Plus, we haven’t even gotten started on the meme coins – more on those later…
As we can see, January was a good month for AI crypto. But the hype was anything but sustained.
AI tokens trade volume – 2023
This is to be expected, though. The mood around crypto can be particularly fickle. AI crypto coins shouldn’t be any different. More to the point, countless successful technologies have met similar fates on their way to the top. As reflected by the perpetually relevant Gartner hype cycle. 
Couple this with the fact that we’re still very much in the midst of a crypto bear market, and faith in both AI crypto projects and new AI technology need not be called into question. There’s every reason to believe that the tables are about to turn, leading us firmly towards a bull market in the not-so-distant future. 
A recent report from Bitget anticipates a resurgence in AI crypto. A lot of this hinges on there being notable breakthroughs in AI. This is hardly something to lack faith in. The prevailing attitude around AI domination seems to be more a case of when, not if.
A wave of such breakthroughs could already be at our doorstep. In mid-August, a collaboration between Fetch.ai and data-sharing platform Ocean launched a new data exchange system that preserves privacy for the user. And the presale for the yPredict coin, powering “the world’s most advanced crypto research platform” is going from strength to strength. 
If we also zoom out and consider the cryptosphere as a whole, it wouldn’t be foolish to believe we’re due another bull run shortly. The halving is approaching, and historically, this has marked the beginning of an upward trajectory.  
Meme coins have had their fifteen minutes of fame on more than one occasion. We’ve had Elon sending Doge to the moon, and 2023’s meme coin mania made plenty of investors happy. Yes, meme coins aren’t exactly pumping right now. But we can remain confident that an AI meme coin bull run is just around the corner. Here’s why.
Anyone who thinks meme coins are dead is misguided. Doge, Shiba Inu, etc., are still front of house on sites like CoinMarketCap. And while the traditional finance world dismisses these coins, a loyal and engaged community lives on. A community that actually understands internet culture and appreciates the fun these coins bring.
Also, Elon Musk can’t be ignored. He continues to pump Doge. Which, in turn, influences other meme coin prices. And for the average investor, he is a much more relatable voice than any of the naysayers in the world of TradFi.
Thirdly, meme coins are the ultimate speculative investment. They’ve created millionaires thanks to their crazy price swings. So for the retail investor who felt like they got into Bitcoin a little too late, they’re always going to look appealing.
This is the party that is just about to get started. Think about it. Everything is in place. It’s full steam ahead on the AI train. As discussed, there’s plenty of reason to believe that the next crypto bull run is on the horizon. And, most importantly, there are some neat meme coin AI projects already bubbling up. Whether it’s the Shibot AI virtual pet, or the ARBDOGE token, AI meme coins are offering loads of untapped potential, fun, and most importantly, gains.
Just as we have seen, meme coins are continuing to pique investors’ interest. One of those that has arrived recently is a particularly fun one that has caught the eye of discerning crypto investors. Sent from the year 2077 Memeinator combines ‘90s action movie branding with a killer sales pitch; destroy all weak meme coins. The Memeinator is on a laser-focused war against the legions of worthless meme coins it sees taking up space in people’s bags. It already has a vibrant community of over 20k Twitter followers and is planning on reaching a $1 billion market cap.
Most importantly, though, it has plans for an AI-powered game: Meme Warfare. Playing as the Memeinator, you will stomp through a virtual wasteland, obliterating weak meme coins. With the help of AI, the coins featured in the game will be a real-time reflection of their performance in the market; if Pepe is underperforming, he will be firmly within Memeinator’s crosshairs. 
AI and crypto are too promising to keep down. And meme coins are too exciting and loved to ignore. It’s very hard to say how the next few months will pan out in the cryptosphere. But when it comes to investing, betting on quality technologies and engaged, committed communities has often been a solid tactic. 
If you’re in this game to make exponential profits, then the AI meme coin space is definitely worth paying attention to. With projects like Memeinator just about to kick off, now is the time to take advantage of the second coming that TradFi money doesn’t see coming. 
Bring your wallet and your memes. It’s going to be quite the ride.

Tesla’s BTC Holdings Stay Put In Q3;"Elon Musk-owned automotive company Tesla revealed that it has managed to hold on to all its Bitcoin even through the financial turmoil of the third quarter of 2023. 
In the midst of a turbulent third quarter of 2023, Tesla, the electric vehicle and clean energy giant led by Elon Musk, has successfully held onto its Bitcoin holdings, maintaining a conservative financial approach.
At its Q3 update, Tesla announced that it retained its entire Bitcoin portfolio, valued at $312,000,000, marking the company’s fifth consecutive quarter without any sales. The Bitcoin stash did dip by $9,000,000 in comparison to the previous quarter. 
Notably, Tesla refrained from any Bitcoin transactions since its substantial sale of over 30,000 BTC, approximately 75% of its holdings, in Q2 2022, which generated $936 million. The company had initially invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in early 2021.
While Tesla remained unwavering in its Bitcoin stance, its financial performance faced some challenges. The company reported adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share, falling short of the projected 73 cents. Moreover, Tesla's revenue amounted to $23.35 billion, which didn't meet the expected $23.9 billion. The gross profit margin for Q3 landed at 17.9%, slightly below the estimated 18%. Following the earnings announcement, Tesla's shares declined by 4.78%, reaching a value of $242.68 per share.
During the shareholder presentation, Tesla also disclosed that its CYBERTRUCK pilot production had already exceeded 125,000 units ahead of the planned November product launch. Even though the company reported a 7% decline in vehicle deliveries in this quarter, it is still hopeful about hitting its yearly target of delivering 1.8 million vehicles. 
Tesla's decision to maintain its Bitcoin holdings amid a volatile market suggests a more cautious approach to financial management. This prudence extends to various aspects of the company's operations, from digital assets to vehicle production and sales. The move echoes Tesla's regular practice of using Say Technologies, an online platform that collects shareholder questions to generate earnings reports.
As Tesla continues to navigate the financial landscape and hold its Bitcoin assets, market observers, investors, and consumers are keen to see how the company will proceed in the final quarter of the year. Tesla's strategy of conserving resources amidst uncertainties positions it at the center of attention, with many awaiting its next moves.

Dan Tapiero’s Insights: A Positive Outlook on the Crypto Market;"The post Dan Tapiero’s Insights: A Positive Outlook on the Crypto Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Dan Tapiero, co-founder of Gold Bullion International, has opened up about the cryptocurrency market, reflecting on the past year and the impact of the FTX incident.
In a recent interview with Coin Bureau Clips, Tapiero discussed his optimism for the crypto space, stating that the fallout from the FTX incident last November impacted sentiment but didn’t deter him. He mentioned that the market downturn coincided with the FTX fraud announcement, and this moment is when he spotted a bullish divergence in the price charts, indicating that selling pressure had eased.
Despite the price corrections in Bitcoin and Ethereum, he found that some of the companies in his portfolio were still performing well, and he stressed the importance of looking beyond the surface when evaluating the crypto market.
Tapiero noted the energy and enthusiasm present, suggesting that the bear market had concluded and a new bullish phase was emerging. He also commented on the regulatory environment, emphasizing that regions like Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United Arab Emirates actively encouraged crypto businesses to set up shop. In contrast, the United States was navigating regulatory uncertainties.
He said, “I think that the low in price happened right on that FTX announcement and the Ethereum price couldn’t make a new low on the announcement of that fraud. So, as an old-time trader, that’s called a bullish divergence. When you have the worst piece of news that you can imagine, and the market can’t make a new low in price, it tells you that all the selling has dried up.”
Tapiero also highlighted the global nature of the crypto industry, with the majority of cryptocurrency trading volume occurring outside the United States. He stressed the need for the US to catch up and recognized the decentralization of the industry.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Bitcoin and Crypto Will Play a Role in Investors’ Flight to Quality;"BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink believes that Bitcoin (BTC) and the rest of the crypto markets are now ready to serve as safe-haven assets amid worsening geopolitical conditions.
In a new Fox Business interview, Fink says that Bitcoin’s rally earlier this week is an indication that investors are seeing BTC as a mature asset that can serve as a store of value in times of crisis.
“I think it’s just an example of the pent-up interest in crypto. We are hearing from clients around the world about the need for crypto.
I think some of this rally is way beyond the rumor. I think the rally [on Monday] is about a flight to quality with all the issues around the Israeli war now, global terrorism and I think there are more people running into a flight to quality whether that is in treasuries, gold or crypto – depending on how you think about it. 
And I believe crypto will play that type of role as a flight to quality.” 
On Monday, Bitcoin rallied briefly above $30,000 after erroneous reports circulated that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted BlackRock’s bid for a spot-based BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $28,448.
Looking at the broader picture, Fink says that people’s attention is being consumed by bad news stories around the globe that they are forgetting about the world-changing potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and technology.
“We are not spending enough time talking about some of the great things that are going on in the world today and that’s when I think about technology and that’s going to be shaping and changing our world. When you think about AI and robotics, this is going to accelerate movement towards nearshoring, and onshoring.
We’re going to be able to use this new technology… [to create] more jobs and more factories [in the US].”

How Bitcoin Is Leading El Salvador’s Revival, Vice President Speaks;"Two years ago, El Salvador became the first country to issue a law adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in its territory. The controversial decision began a new era for the country’s economic trajectory, which international authorities have questioned.
Felix Ulloa, Vice President of El Salvador, recently shared new details about the country’s progress with the Bitcoin Law following its second anniversary. The interview was published by Forbes and conducted by Javier Bastardo and touched on several key and controversial points.
Since introducing the “Bitcoin law,” the country has launched several initiatives to attract fresh capital and tourists to El Salvador. First, the central government announced “BTC Bonds,” a financial instrument to tie its national debt to the cryptocurrency.
This strategy managed to gain the attention of the US financial sector. Data from the report indicates that some Wall Street firms jumping into these bonds scored profits north of 50%, with Converium Capital recording a 180% return on their investment.
Bastardo pointed out that despite the massive return, the firm will hold on to its position, which suggests Converium expects further gains. On this phenomenon, and the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender and its impact on the country, the Vice-President of El Salvador stated:
(…) but is the result of applying a financial policy from the government of the president Nayib Bukele, exercised by our entities in charge. There were reactions in both directions. Some multilateral organizations initially made objections. Still, the enthusiasm that started in the sphere of the digital economy, with bitcoiners, where El Salvador, having positioned itself as the first country to adopt a cryptocurrency as legal tender, was at the forefront and attracted many investors who are in fact installed in Salvador (…).
The Vice-President of El Salvador claims that as many as 80 entities are currently working in the country due to its politics and regulatory environment. Amongst these companies, the country welcomed big tech giants Meta (formerly Facebook) and Google.
Ulloa believes these partners are essential for the “modernization of the country” and to complete its history of rebirth. The Central American nation has faced economic and social turmoil due to its high crime rates.
These rates have declined over the last few years and under Bukele’s government. These factors comprised the government’s strategy to enter a new era. The Vice-President concluded:
Without a doubt, tourism and the use of digital currencies go hand in hand and are a sign of that future and the rebirth of our country.
As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at around $28,000 after experiencing a spike in volatility.

Crypto Billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s NYC Network: A Trial Revelation;"The post Crypto Billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s NYC Network: A Trial Revelation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
In the months before FTX’s collapse and eventual arrest, Sam Bankman-Fried held several personal meetings with New York’s leading political and financial power players. Even one event was held at the Mayor of New York City, Eric Adams’ preferred late-night venue.
Special Agent Richard Busick led the jury through a series of meetings on Tuesday.
According to the FBI agent specializing in examining and analyzing phone data, his testimony during Bankman-Fried’s trial revealed that the former crypto billionaire frequently visited the Big Apple in 2022 despite residing in the Bahamas.  This portion of his testimony was probably included to emphasize how the alleged crimes of Bankman-Fried transpired in New York City. 
It suggests that Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent activities were not limited to the Bahamas but directly impacted New York City’s financial landscape. His frequent meetings with influential individuals raise concerns about potential collaboration or manipulation within the city’s financial circles. This information adds weight to the prosecution’s case against him and strengthens the argument for his guilt in the eyes of the jury.
Reports show that Bankman-Fried might have been scheduled to meet with Saudi Arabia’s finance minister, Khalid A. Al-Falih, or the head of its sovereign wealth fund, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, at one point and then show up for a 15-minute photo session with Forbes in midtown Manhattan at another. 
He delegated all scheduling to Natalie Tien, his assistant, whose description of dealing with the frazzled CEO served as the inspiration for the introductory part of Michael Lewis’ currently most talked-about-book “Going Infinite”, about bringing out SBF’s real story.

Bankman-Fried and Mayor Adams dined together in March 2022 at Osteria La Baia, an Italian restaurant near the Museum of Modern Art run by Hizzoner’s friends and serves as the mayor’s informal after-hours workspace. 
The “Hold for Mayor” meeting is listed on the mayor’s public calendar for March 3, 2022, at 8:30 p.m. ET, although it does not specify who he met with. 
Adams is a well-known crypto enthusiast. His first salary as mayor was paid in ether and bitcoin. Although he was paid in dollars, the funds were promptly changed to bitcoin and ether. He has proposed turning the city into a center of cryptocurrency.
Bankman-Fried was scheduled to meet New York Governor Kathy Hochul in September 2022 at The Capital Grille restaurant, an unusual meeting location for the self-proclaimed vegan.
The emails that the prosecutors chose demonstrated how in-demand Bankman-Fried was before things went south. The investment community eagerly sought after the crypto-wunderkind, and 32 different firms made requests to attend a dinner, including George Soros and Morgan Stanley.

The post Crypto Billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s NYC Network: A Trial Revelation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
In the months before FTX’s collapse and eventual arrest, Sam Bankman-Fried held several personal meetings with New York’s leading political and financial power players. Even one event was held at the Mayor of New York City, Eric Adams’ preferred late-night venue.
Special Agent Richard Busick led the jury through a series of meetings on Tuesday.
According to the FBI agent specializing in examining and analyzing phone data, his testimony during Bankman-Fried’s trial revealed that the former crypto billionaire frequently visited the Big Apple in 2022 despite residing in the Bahamas.  This portion of his testimony was probably included to emphasize how the alleged crimes of Bankman-Fried transpired in New York City. 
It suggests that Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent activities were not limited to the Bahamas but directly impacted New York City’s financial landscape. His frequent meetings with influential individuals raise concerns about potential collaboration or manipulation within the city’s financial circles. This information adds weight to the prosecution’s case against him and strengthens the argument for his guilt in the eyes of the jury.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Discount Narrows As Court Gears Up To Issue GBTC Mandate: Report;"The long-discounted price of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is catching up to its net asset value (NAV) amid potentially positive judicial developments.
GBTC is trading at a -15.87% discount to its net asset value as of October 13th, compared to around 21% at the beginning of the month, more than 43% in June and nearly 50% at points in December and January, according to YCharts.
Discount to NAV is a metric that tracks the difference between the fund’s current value from its true value.
The shrinking discount materialized as news broke in recent days that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) doesn’t intend to appeal a court ruling mandating the regulator reconsider Grayscale’s bid to convert GBTC into a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Last year, the digital asset management giant sued the SEC immediately after the regulator rejected the firm’s bid to turn their flagship product into an ETF.
A federal judge ruled in August that the SEC has to reconsider Grayscale’s application to avoid arbitrariness and inconsistency.
Citing a source familiar with the matter, Reuters reported last week that the SEC has no plans to appeal the judge’s decision.
In a statement provided to Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, Grayscale also confirmed that development.
“The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure’s 45-day period to seek rehearing has now passed. The Court will now issue its final mandate within seven calendar days. The Grayscale team remains operationally ready to convert GBTC to an ETF upon the SEC’s approval, and we look forward to sharing more information as soon as practicable.”

Dogecoin Price Would Likely Pump on Bitcoin ETF Approval (Op-Ed);"TL;DR

Dogecoin has moved along in lockstep with Bitcoin as crypto markets wait with bated breath as institutional hedge funds hound the SEC for the go-ahead to launch a Bitcoin ETF.
If and when the Securities and Exchange Commission finally approves a spot price ETF for the world’s oldest and most trusted cryptocurrency, there’s a reasonable chance Dogecoin price might rally along with Bitcoin.
When $8.5 trillion investing giant BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, BTC rallied over 20% on crypto exchanges from $25,500 to $30,749. CNBC noted:
“Investors are growing bullish about the prospects of BlackRock and other major institutional names getting involved in digital assets.”
Vijay Ayyar, head of CoinDCX, the largest crypto exchange in India, said:
“The slate of spot bitcoin ETF application announcements by larger institutions has definitely brought back bullishness into the crypto markets.”
Meanwhile, Dogecoin price on crypto exchanges pumped over 36% over the same period, from $0.06 to $0.082.
Later, on August 29, a US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled against the SEC.
The court found in favor of crypto hedge fund Grayscale that the SEC’s rejection of Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF application was unjustified. The judge called the commission’s actions an “unlike the treatment of like kind products,” referring to previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs.
When that happened, Bitcoin rallied again. Meanwhile, DOGE also pumped right along with BTC. Dogecoin price on crypto exchanges went from 0.063 to 0.066 as Bitcoin traded from $26,000 to $27,721.
Three days later, when the SEC pushed back the date to clarify its explanation about Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF application, BTC and DOGE prices both fell in tandem right back to their previous levels.
It’s been a rough ride for investors, but cryptocurrency bulls are hoping that sometime in the near future, the SEC might finally throw the markets a bone.
Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results, but there is certainly a recent pattern this year of Dogecoin price rallies and routs on new updates in the spot Bitcoin ETF situation.

Analyst Expects BTC to Retrace by -30% to $20K, Will It?;"Crypto Trader and Analyst Rekt Capital tweeted that BTC could go through a period of retracement soon. As such, the analyst expects it to retrace by -30% whereby BTC could reach somewhere as low as $20,000.
The analyst supplemented this notion by considering the pre-halving phase, where BTC retraced by -25 in 2015/2016 and -38 in 2019. In particular, BTC was retracing 180 days prior to BTC halving, hence, as there are approximately 180 days for BTC halving from now, the analyst put forward his prediction.

Top Recession Trades, Will Bitcoin Breakout Soon? ;"The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.
Topics this week:
Last week, I wrote about The Bitcoin-Gold-China Connection. I pointed to the recent bitcoin and gold indirect correlation, but also to several interesting correlations between the three assets. I want to revisit that topic upfront, because a pioneer of the modern hedge fund industry, Paul Tudor Jones, said in an interview that he is bullish on the “barbarous relics,” lumping bitcoin in with gold.
“You know more likely than not, we’re going to go into recession, and there are some pretty clear cut recession trades.”
1) “The yield curve gets really steep, and the term-premium goes into the back end.”
Translation: The short end of the yield curve falls relative to the long end. We already see this in the yield curve steepening, specifically the 10Y-2Y (2s10s) and the 10Y-3M (3M10Y). Yields tend to un-invert prior to recessions. In 2008, it took 36 weeks between un-inverting and recession. In 2020, it took 25 weeks, but easily could have taken longer.
Projecting forward, the curve is still inverted, and if we estimate an un-inversion by November this year, a delay of 30 weeks takes us to July 2024. Not surprisingly, this matches the Fed Funds futures pricing in the Fed cuts we discussed in a previous letter. It also gives bitcoin plenty of time to rally through the halving.
2) “The stock market typically, right before a recession, declines about 12%.”
We’ve written about this topic recently as well. While Jones is correct that “right before” the recession stocks typically fall, it is the 18 months leading up to recession that we are in right now that are very positive. He acknowledges this with his clarifying statement, “that’s probably going to happen at some point, from some level.” The emphasis here being that this is his statement, meaning it could climb a lot before that imminent recession drop.
3) “You look at the big shorts in gold. More likely than not, in a recession the market is really long assets like bitcoin and gold. So, there’s probably about $40 billion in buying that has to come into gold at some point. So, yeah, I like bitcoin and I like gold right here.”
Jones says that bitcoin and gold will be correlated and rising in a pre-recessionary environment. We agree, and that being the case, recession is likely further out than many expect as we wait for the recent disconnect between gold and bitcoin to sync back up. 
Checking in on bitcoin and gold, we see the indirect relationship continues. It is likely the gold side of this correlation that is the one out of sync. It remains a high probability that China was dumping gold to protect the yuan instead of dumping dollars. Gold and bitcoin will likely get back into sync soon, as Jones predicts. We are also watching the yuan closely in this respect, hoping it has bottomed for the time being. 
Let me make a case for uncoordinated price suppression in bitcoin with a few charts. I do not think it is a grand conspiracy against bitcoin, but a natural result of the market structure as it exists today.
Ethereum is bleeding out. Fee burning couldn’t save it, Proof-of-stake couldn’t save it, and now the futures ETFs can’t save it. It’s going down versus the dollar and much more versus bitcoin itself. The recent BitVM on Bitcoin is not an Ethereum killer, but it does rob Ethereum of tons of excitement and hype. There’s simply no momentum to speak of left in altcoins.
I have a theory why bitcoin is having a little trouble here compared to our other calls. Bitcoin is being held back by algorithmic trading bots built to arbitrage bitcoin/ether discrepancies in price movement. I don’t have direct evidence as of yet, but this could explain the disconnect between bitcoin’s price movement and all other markets right now.
Another source of bitcoin price suppression is Binance. Rumors are flying that the BNB token is also highly leveraged like FTX’s FTT token was. The allegation is that Binance is trading bitcoin for BNB to prop up the price.
Here we have two temporary sources of bitcoin selling: Ethereum arbitrage and Binance trying to prop BNB up. Even if there is partial truth about either one, it would be a good reason for bitcoin’s relatively unexpected weakness. 
This weakness is likely temporary because the stock market is rising, bonds yields are falling, and the dollar is falling. This adds more weight to the Bitcoin industry explanation for the slight price dip.
We can see above that the 200-day (gray) fought off repeated and prolonged attempts to continue higher. In our estimation, this is evidence of heavy marks on that level from trading bots with a simple rule: If bitcoin is at the 200-day and ether is below, short bitcoin and long ether. Something like that.
Daily momentum indicators are threatening a bearish shift. RSI has broken trend and MACD could cross bearish. On the weekly timeframe however, these same indicators are markedly more bullish.
Bitcoin is sitting right on solid volume support at $27,000, with plenty of room above the strongest support area if there was a dip. Once bitcoin breaks this downward trend, it will rapidly test the resistance band at $31,000.
There is another possibility we have to mention: Bitcoin is the leading indicator in this market. If that is the case, we would expect stocks to rollover and yields to continue higher, sending us back to the drawing board on our model. Of course, I don’t think that is the case, but we will have to cross that bridge when we get there. For now, the model has been successful on many macro and micro calls and the traditional markets agree with us.
Legend Paul Tudor Jones outlined three recession trades we took a look at above. They are a steepening trade that we already see taking shape, a short stock market trade that we don’t quite see developing yet, and bitcoin and gold. A deep dive of the Ethereum, BNB and bitcoin charts reveals some insights about correlation and the state of this market.

XRP price is gaining pace above the $0.50 resistance against the US Dollar. The SEC’s case against Ripple’s executives was dropped, sparking bullish moves.
After forming a base above the $0.480 level, XRP started a fresh increase. Recently, the SEC dropped its case against Ripple’s executives. It sparked a sharp increase in XRP above the $0.50 resistance.
There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $0.4885 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $0.5510 swing high to the $0.4730 low.
XRP price is now trading above $0.505 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It is also helping Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other cryptocurrencies in moving higher.
On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.524 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $0.5510 swing high to the $0.4730 low. The first major resistance is near the $0.532 level. A close above the $0.532 level could send the price toward the $0.550 resistance.

If the bulls remain in action above the $0.550 resistance level, there could be a drift toward the $0.565 resistance. Any more gains might send XRP toward the $0.585 resistance.
If XRP fails to clear the $0.524 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.512 zone.
The next major support is at $0.505. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.505 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.4850 support zone.
Technical Indicators
4-Hours MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.
4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $0.512, $0.505, and $0.485.

Ethereum Whales Hold a Third of Supply But Selling Continues ;"Ethereum is getting more concentrated into the hands of whales, according to the latest data from on-chain analytics provider Santiment.
On October 18, Santiment reported that billionaire Ethereum investors with more than 1 million ETH hold 32.2% of the available supply for the first time since 2016.
Furthermore, Ethereum transactions exceeding $1 million hit their second-highest day in a month.
 #Ethereum‘s whale addresses in the #billionaire tier (holding at least 1M $ETH) now hold 32.3% of the available supply for the first time since 2016. Yesterday’s transactions valued at $1M+ also had its 2nd highest day in 5 weeks. History is being made. https://t.co/sywdtn14k5 pic.twitter.com/SdbSrChJCf
— Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 17, 2023

With whales controlling a third of the supply, Ethereum has become very concentrated in the hands of the wealthy. However, Santiment didn’t specify whether these figures included entities such as centralized exchanges or stablecoin issuers that hold a lot of ETH.
What has been analyzed, however, is the selling patterns, and whales have been offloading ETH over the past few months.
According to data from Glassnode, there is a “striking difference” in the behavior of major Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings, indicating divergent views among crypto whales.
Since 2020, Ethereum whales, or those that hold over 1,000 ETH in this case, have been progressively lowering their holdings. This has resulted in the sale of about $20 million in ETH.
However, Bitcoin whales holding more than 1,000 BTC have primarily maintained their holdings, according to the data shared by CoinMarketCap.

Nevertheless, the Ethereum staking narrative has never been stronger, with more of the asset being staked than ever before despite withdrawals opening in April.
There are currently a record 27.6 million ETH staked valued at around $43.4 billion, according to Beaconcha.in. This represents around 23% of the total supply.
Furthermore, that supply has declined by 260,640 ETH or $409 million since the Merge in September last year, according to Ultrasound.Money.
None of the bullish staking or deflationary supply fundamentals have been able to beat the Ethereum bears off yet.
ETH is down another 1.3% on the day, trading at $1,568 at the time of writing. The asset has lost 4.5% over the past fortnight and continues to decline with the rest of the altcoins.
Ethereum is now 68% down from its all-time high, whereas Bitcoin, which has performed better this week, is down 59% from its peak.

Is This The Best Bitcoin Price Indicator Right Now? Must-Know Details;"Following recent geopolitical events, the correlation between gold and Bitcoin prices has once again come under scrutiny by market analysts. Here’s a comprehensive dive into the relationship and its implications.
After the recent Israel-Hamas war, gold experienced a rapid uptick in its price. This shift interestingly mirrored movements in the Bitcoin market, emphasizing a revived correlation between the two assets. Skew, a reputable market analyst, shared his insights on X (formerly Twitter), noting on October 11 that “correlation has been rather loosely applicable to BTC periods of 35 days + where there’s price disconnection between both markets.”
However, only days later, on October 16, he observed a potential “re-correlation” as both Bitcoin followed the latest gold rally. Today, the statement stands stronger with Skew’s latest tweet, “BTC & gold correlation still there it seems. Gold may lead the next big move for BTC.”
In his recent insights shared in the Onramp Weekly Roundup, Bitcoin analyst Dylan LeClair emphasized the implications of the ongoing selloff in government bonds. Rising costs for long-term financing directly influence the global cost of capital, offering a valuation yardstick for various assets.
More significantly, the treasury market underpins the global financial ecosystem. Its current instability could pressure asset prices and exacerbate the pre-existing debt cycle, potentially endangering the US’s fiscal position. This precarious state contrasts sharply with the US administration’s fiscal actions, as evidenced by plans like the “WHITE HOUSE EYES $100 BILLION UKRAINE, ISRAEL AND BORDER ASK”, suggesting a lack of fiscal restraint, according to LeClair.
Further complicating matters, Bill Dudley, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in his recent Bloomberg piece, noted the likelihood of the current cycle of quantitative tightening (QT) persisting until late 2025. This prolonged QT could heighten long-term interest rates and risk treasury market turbulence. Yet, should severe dysfunction manifest in the treasury market, the Federal Reserve might reconsider its QT trajectory.
Interestingly, post the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the subsequent confiscation of Russia’s G7 reserves, gold, and real yields have shown an atypical positive correlation, challenging their historical negative relationship.
In this evolving geopolitical landscape where even G7 sovereign debt isn’t immune to confiscation, traditional ‘safe assets’ are being reevaluated.  This uncertainty combined with the not-so-safe “risk free” yield from treasuries has bolstered gold’s position (and price) as a counter-risk monetary asset and may push Bitcoin on a similar trajectory.
According to LeClair:
This repositioning, however, isn’t limited to gold alone. Bitcoin, with its unique advantages and growing liquidity profile, is on a similar trajectory, albeit still in the very early stages of its monetization with a $500b market cap.
Under these current conditions, the price of gold may be a leading indicator for the price of Bitcoin, assuming that the correlation between the two assets continues. This would imply that Bitcoin is classified as a “safe haven” asset like gold by a majority of investors, rather than a “risk asset”.
However, this view is not shared by all. James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares, pointed out that the Bitcoin market has shifted its focus after the fake news regarding a spot Bitcoin ETF approval. He remarked that investors now seem to prioritize the ETF approval over macro expectations, placing less emphasis on the Federal Reserve’s actions.
Since the Coin Telegraph tweet mistake on a Bitcoin Spot ETF approval, Bitcoin prices have decoupled from December interest rate expectations – it seems like investors are solely focussed on the ETF approval now, and not what the FED does.
At press time, Bitcoin traded at $28,450.

Ethereum-Based Altcoin That’s Up 700% in Two Months Primed To Grind All the Way Back Down, Says Crypto Analyst;"An altcoin running on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain looks poised to give up a significant part of its massive gains in the last two months, according to a widely followed analyst.
Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 196,800 followers on the social media platform X that the native asset of the decentralized oracle Tellor Tributes (TRB) has likely ended its multi-month uptrend.
TRB, which rallied from a low of $9.11 in mid-August to a high of $79 last week, appears to have exhausted all bullish momentum, according to the trader.
“TRB: I think that was the blow-off top. Expecting this to eventually die and grind all the way back down.” 
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that TRB will plummet all the way down to $32.
At time of writing, TRB is trading for $59.68.
The crypto strategist is also keeping a close watch on the price action of Ethereum rival Avalanche (AVAX). According to the analyst, AVAX may rally on the back of news that the Avalanche-based social finance (SocialFi) protocol Stars Arena is once again live after succumbing to a massive security breach last week.
“AVAX: long the Arena
Stars Arena coming back online + this entire area looks like a solid support region. Short-term bullish.” 
Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to predict that AVAX will rally toward the $10.60 level.
At time of writing, AVAX is trading for $9.39.

SEC warns investors after false Bitcoin ETF approval reports;"Amid a chaotic trading day intensified by misinformation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a clear caution on social media. “Careful what you read on the internet. The best source of information about the SEC is the SEC,” the agency advised, following false reports that it had greenlit a Bitcoin ETF from BlackRock’s iShares. This narrative led to significant market unrest.
The confusion began with Cointelegraph, a leading cryptocurrency media platform, announcing the supposed SEC approval. This news rapidly spread across social networks. However, the actual situation was quite contrary. BlackRock intervened to clarify that its ETF submission was still under analysis. Cointelegraph amended its article, incorporating the term “reportedly,” which ignited humor and criticism regarding its journalistic standards and the hastiness in broadcasting such pivotal news.
The outlet’s mistake had real-world impacts, contributing to approximately $182.5 million in trade liquidations within a day. Bitcoin’s value also experienced a rollercoaster ride, soaring beyond $30,000 and diving by 8%. Analysts and market observers, including Bitfinexed, have underscored the serious aftermath of such misinformation. They warn that these instances could provide a foundation for the SEC to reject upcoming Bitcoin ETF proposals.
Despite these setbacks, expert insight in the industry continues to lean towards optimism. Notably, Bloomberg analysts are forecasting a 90% chance of the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF by January 10, 2024, a sentiment that indicates enduring confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential.
BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, discussed the fiasco in a Fox Business interview, interpreting it as a sign of the growing curiosity in cryptocurrency investments. He highlighted the global escalating demand and excitement among investors based on dialogues with BlackRock’s clientele. For the future, Fink envisions cryptocurrency becoming a crucial part of investment portfolios, especially as a buffer in unstable economic climates.

We Asked ChatGPT if Ripple (XRP) Will Reach $1 in 2023;"TL;DR

Ripple’s XRP went through a rollercoaster of a quarter in Q2. It was in July when the US Court decided that cryptocurrency doesn’t constitute an investment contract when sold on secondary marketplaces.
To those unaware, back in 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Ripple for conducting an unregistered offering of securities, essentially alleging that XRP falls within that definition.
Over the years, the case has had a very negative impact on XRP’s price as investors remained cautious of what its outcome might be.
In July this year, the presiding judge – Analisa Torres – ruled that XRP sold on secondary exchanges does not constitute an investment contract. The effect on its price can be observed in the following chart:
Unfortunately for XRP, it has been unable to sustain the increased valuation, and it’s trading at more or less the same level it was before the ruling.
Now that we’re entering the final quarter of this year, we decided to ask ChatGPT whether or not it can get back to those highs and even surpass them.
First things first, there have been multiple XRP price predictions of late, and some of them will most definitely shock you. To find out more about them, check out our most recent video on the matter:

ChatGPT seems to think that there are some factors that could potentially influence XRP’s price to reach $1 in 2023.
Positive sentiment and increased demand from investors can drive up the price of XRP. Favorable news, developments, or partnerships related to Ripple (the company behind XRP) could boost sentiment.
In addition, the chatbot believes that regulatory clarity, as well as positive developments in the case between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, could also impact its price positively.
In addition, other factors that may drive XRP’s price to $1 in 2023 include:
In any case, it’s worth noting that XRP’s price increased to above $0.50 yesterday on false reports of an improved spot Bitcoin ETF approval.

Estate of Bankrupt Crypto Exchange FTX Abruptly Stakes Over $144 Million in Solana (SOL);"The estate belonging to the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX was just spotted staking over $144 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL) as the firm’s bankruptcy process unfolds.
According to blockchain explorer SolanaFM, the address associated with FTX and its trading arm Alameda Research created a new stake of 5,546,217.04 SOL tokens.
Analysis from pseudonymous on-chain researcher Ashpool suggests FTX subsequently staked all of the tokens through Figment, a digital asset staking service built for institutions. According to Figment, Robinhood, Binance.US and Anchorage Digital also stake through the platform.
On Solana, stakers are currently earning roughly 7% APY (annual percentage yield), depending on the staking platform, and rewards are distributed every two or three days.
The FTX estate already holds approximately $1 billion worth of Solana, but much of it is locked up until 2028 as part of its vesting schedule agreement.
Solana co-creator Anatoly Yakovenko said last month that if he had the power, he would prefer if FTX’s SOL tokens were given directly to the failed exchange’s customers as part of a compensation plan.
“My wish would be to distribute the SOL to all the FTX customers directly. Probably the least worst outcome for everyone…
And getting it distributed to 5 million users would benefit the network over the long term. Win-win in my honest opinion…
Seems like it would have been a much faster process and with less legal overhead if everything was just evenly split across all the users and let each user do what they will.”

Solana co-creator Anatoly Yakovenko said last month that if he had the power, he would prefer if FTX’s SOL tokens were given directly to the failed exchange’s customers as part of a compensation plan.
“My wish would be to distribute the SOL to all the FTX customers directly. Probably the least worst outcome for everyone…
And getting it distributed to 5 million users would benefit the network over the long term. Win-win in my honest opinion…
Seems like it would have been a much faster process and with less legal overhead if everything was just evenly split across all the users and let each user do what they will.”

XRP Price Prediction: Rare Bent Fork Pattern Predicts Explosive 3000% Surge To $15;"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has been continuously bullish on the future of the XRP price and the latest prediction proves this. This time around, the crypto analyst is using a rare Bent Fork Pattern to back up his prediction that the XRP price is headed for double-digits.
Egrag first mentioned the Bent Fork Pattern in a June post while showing a bullish roadmap for the XRP price. In the earlier post, the analyst points out ‘four distinct tracks’. These include the “Track A) Major Historical Support, Track B) Ranging Zone, Track C) Mid-Cycle Top, and Track D) Cycle Top.”
As Egrag explained, the Track D is the cycle top which could see the altcoin’s price reach as high as $15, although not without incidence. Despite expecting a surge, Egrag says that XRP could fall lower before this happens. However, the analyst asks investors not to fret when this happens. Rather, they should see it as an opportunity to buy the cryptocurrency for lower prices.
Now, four months after the initial post was made, Egrag has revisited this Bent Fork Pattern, doubling down on the previous prediction. In a post made on Wednesday, October 18, Egrag updated the previous prediction, showing what needs to happen for the XRP price to reach the lofty price of $15. This would mean at least a 3,000% price increase for XRP if the pattern plays out exactly as expected.
In the chart below, the analyst explains that the XRP price needs to breach the white line for the rally to begin. “the real excitement is if #XRP shatters the ‘White’ Ascending Triangle – get ready for some market-shaking action,” the analyst said.

Looking at a time frame, the crypto analyst asks investors to keep an eye out for the 3rd and 4th week of November as this is when something interesting might happen. “Feeling uncertain about your next move? This might just be your last chance to seize a buying opportunity,” Egrag said in closing.
Interestingly, Egrag’s XRP price prediction using the Bent Fork Pattern also matches their other predictions for the altcoin. Earlier in the week, Egrag had also put forward another forecast but used the Elliot Wave Theory to present the bull case.
As Egrag notes, the fifth wave is where the main movement really lies where the analyst expects the price surge to happen. Just like with the Bent Fork Pattern, it also suggests a double-digit price level at the top. However, the wave theory takes it a step further with a $27 price mark compared to the Bent Fork’s $15 mark.
Another similarity between both predictions is that the June Bent Fork chart shows the XRP price at $15 somewhere between 2025 and 2026. This is the same timeframe presented using the Elliot Wave analysis, so most of this will likely play out in the bull market.

Bitcoin Price Prediction: Will The Bull Run Continue?;"The cryptocurrency market recently experienced a surge in prices, largely attributed to the news of the Bitcoin ETF approval. Investors and traders were buzzing with excitement, only to find out that the news was false. This incident has once again brought the topic of Bitcoin price prediction to the forefront, with many wondering what lies ahead for the world’s most popular cryptocurrency.
In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin’s price has seen a mix of highs and lows. Starting at a price of $27,392, it experienced a slight dip to $26,873 before rebounding to its current price of $28,522. This represents a 5% increase in just one day.
Looking at the past 7 days, Bitcoin’s journey has been a bit rocky. The price started the week at $27,392, dipped to $26,873, and then gradually climbed to its current position. Over the week, Bitcoin has seen a decrease of approximately 2.48%, but the recent 24-hour surge has provided some optimism for investors.
The recent buzz around the Bitcoin ETF approval, which turned out to be false, has left many in the crypto community in a state of uncertainty. However, the possibility of a Bitcoin ETF being approved is not off the table. Regulatory bodies are closely monitoring the cryptocurrency market, and there’s a growing sentiment that an ETF could be on the horizon. If and when this happens, Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, is poised to see higher prices as institutional investors could potentially enter the market in droves.
While the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF is a significant factor, it’s essential to remember that other elements also influence Bitcoin prices. Geopolitical events, such as the Ukraine war and the Gaza war, have historically impacted the cryptocurrency market. Economic situations, both globally and locally, can sway investor sentiment. Additionally, crypto-specific industry news, such as regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market trends, play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s price trajectory.
For those looking to invest in Bitcoin, Bitpanda is an excellent choice. As one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitpanda offers a user-friendly platform, making it easy for both beginners and seasoned traders. Moreover, the exchange boasts low fees, ensuring that investors get the most out of their transactions. Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or trade, Bitpanda provides a seamless and efficient experience.

BlackRock and JPMorgan’s Strategic Moves Hint at Potential Crypto Market Rally;"The post BlackRock and JPMorgan’s Strategic Moves Hint at Potential Crypto Market Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The 5th largest crypto, XRP, has seen its share of ups and downs, yet its steadfast community, known as the XRP army, remains unfazed. Despite recent bearish trends, XRP has managed to hold its ground, even as it dipped below a crucial support line. 
This resilience hints that the recent pullback may be a short-term reversal rather than a prolonged downturn. With the SEC’s softened attitude towards Bitcoin ETF approval, more prominent institutions are taking a keen interest in crypto assets. Here’s the top reason behind the anticipated bull run. 
While XRP struggles to regain the $0.5 price mark, despite this, Forbes is uncovering a massive bull run. It could be a reality soon as whales switch from Ethereum to XRP, and accumulation is up. Santiment reports that wallets with 100K to 100M XRP possess $7.89 billion in currency, up from $7.16 billion last year. 
On similar grounds, Senior Forbes Contributor Billy Bambrough, hints at a significant potential upswing, driven by an unexpected force. Forbes unveils the silent but strategic preparations by global financial titans BlackRock and JPMorgan, setting the stage for a significant surge in the cryptocurrency market.
The report highlights collaborative efforts between BlackRock and JPMorgan in the crypto space. BlackRock has achieved a historic milestone by becoming the first Wall Street giant to adopt JPMorgan’s blockchain-powered collateral settlement program. As outlined by BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink, this move aligns with the broader vision of ushering in the next era for financial markets, including a pivotal role for cryptocurrencies. 
Meanwhile, the report also unveils BlackRock’s utilization of JPMorgan’s Ethereum-based Onyx network and tokenized collateral service. This allowed the conversion of shares from one of its financial market funds, ultimately facilitating a transfer to Barclays in an over-the-counter derivatives transaction. Fink’s recognition of blockchain’s pivotal role further underscores the significance of this technology in financial operations.
On the flip side, Ripple is making strides in its legal battle against the SEC; combined with increasing developments in the blockchain sector and heightened XRP volatility, bullish sentiment is growing. Several analysts have offered diverse forecasts, but a recent X post from user EGRAG CRYPTO has caught attention, speculating that XRP could reach a staggering $27 within three years. This bold prediction is rooted in the “Elliott Wave Theory,” highlighting the significance of the pivotal “Wave 3” for XRP’s potential rise. 
In other news, the SEC’s active engagement with Bitcoin ETF applicants hints at the possibility of $17.7 trillion entering the market, surpassing existing futures ETF volumes.

BlackRock Reacts To False Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval News In A Positive Way;"Investment management firm Blackrock has reacted to rumors about the approval of its Bitcoin Spot ETF application by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which caused quite a stir among the cryptocurrency community.
On Monday, crypto news outlet CoinTelegraph posted on X (formerly Twitter) that the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved a long-anticipated application of Bitcoin Spot ETF, but later retracted the report. However, the post sparked excitement within the crypto community causing the Bitcoin price to rise rapidly.
The cryptocurrency’s price surged to almost $30,000 earlier in the day after the alleged post was made by Cointelegraph yesterday. However, the cryptocurrency’s price fell almost immediately after the report was proven to be false by Blackrock’s Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink and other prominent voices in the crypto community.
Eleanor Terrett was the first to report that this news was false after speaking with BlackRock and that the company’s Bitcoin Spot ETF is still under review by the US regulator. 

In an interview with Fox Business, Fink, who said he only learned about the ‘news’ hours later due to him being extremely busy all day, took a rather positive stance on the event. According to the CEO, noting that Monday’s event solely proved the worldwide need and desire for a Bitcoin spot ETF.
“I think the rally today is about a flight to quality, with all the issues around the Israeli war now, global terrorism,” Fink said. “I think there are more people running into a flight to quality, whether that is in Treasuries, gold, or crypto, depending on how you think of it. And I believe crypto will play that type of role, as a flight to quality.”
The SEC also confirmed that the alleged news report was false and that the application is still pending. “Careful what you read on the internet. The best source of information about the SEC is the SEC.” the post read.
So far, CoinTelegrah has apologized with a post on X for the false report it posted “which led to the dissemination of inaccurate information.” The crypto media outlet later posted the result of its internal investigation which showed a team member had posted the ‘news’ without getting approval from its editorial team.
Crypto tracker, Coinglass revealed that short trading positions held by investors betting on lower prices were liquidated to the tune of over $104 million within 24 hours due to the false news.

Lightning Network Sees Record Adoption Amidst New Applications;"The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.
The Lightning Network, a node-based payment protocol designed to solve Bitcoin’s solvability problem, has shattered all expectations of success with its rise of over 1200% in the last two years.
The Lightning Network is a “layer 2” decentralized network based upon Bitcoin’s blockchain, designed to solve the scalability problem in bitcoin transactions. Essentially, Bitcoin can function as a trustless and decentralized global currency because of its proof-of-work system that can verify all operations on the blockchain, one block at a time. However, as Bitcoin has exploded in popularity and value over the years of its existence, the number of transactions that need verification has risen logarithmically, into the tens of millions per month. And every one of these transactions requires computing power to be verified.
The tremendous growth of Bitcoin usage and adoption has come with a double-edged sword, that there are increasing millions of people who want to try out Bitcoin to purchase their coffee, a cab service, or any of the other million everyday transactions that make up normal life. But the transaction fees necessary to validate these tiny purchases have only increased, to the extent that the cost of spending the money would outweigh the actual expenditure dozens of times over. This problem has been anticipated since the early days, and since 2015-2016, new innovation has been creating the Lightning Network.
A system of Lightning nodes operating on top of Bitcoin can handle huge numbers of microtransactions in a decentralized fashion without directly updating the blockchain, and these trades are resolved en masse in a minimal number of on-chain transactions. Usage is near-instantaneous, and the efficiency improvement is a game changer. Since Lightning made its first public debut in 2019, it has only grown in popularity over the past few years. What has been unexpected, however, has been the extreme growth potential in this protocol even years after its launch.
New data from River, a firm specializing in financial services and Bitcoin technology, has shown that Lightning Network transactions have risen by a mind-boggling figure, more than 1,200%, in the last two years alone. River’s report, published on October 12, set out to disprove myths about the Lightning Network. Far from stagnating or plateauing, the active usage of the protocol has shot up tremendously starting in 2021. River estimated that there are anywhere between 279k and 1.1 million users per month, a wide figure made complicated by the difficulty at measuring private transactions and those between two participants.
Furthermore, even as their data has suggested that the number of active nodes has plateaued since mid-2022, the Network’s actual capacity to process bitcoins has been steadily increasing all the same. River draws attention to several subtler factors of Lightning Network success in their study: for example, the fact that Bitcoin’s highest prices ever took place in 2021. During the period observed, they claim that “Google search volume for Bitcoin decreased by 45%, and the price decreased by 44%”, and yet still the Lightning Network has grown out of all proportion in the same time period! This suggests that more experienced users, those who remain invested in Bitcoin’s revolutionary economic model despite its setbacks, have been a key force in adopting this protocol.
Additionally, the report analyzed the types of transactions that 27% of their measured transactions were conducted in some unexpected “growth areas”, such as tipping on social media and streamers and also the gaming industry in general. Indeed, on the same day as this report’s release, gaming firm THNDR began a limited rollout of its new API, Clinch. It uses the Lightning Network to enable gamers worldwide a novel new access to the gambling industry: a series of games with Lightning-based wagers that can be played anywhere, instantaneously, for no fees with bets as low as one satoshi. Considering that increasing numbers of Lightning users have taken to such games in recent years, a success here could break into a multibillion dollar industry.
Bitcoin Magazine Pro is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support our work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.
This is not even the only new application for the Lightning Network launched in mid-October 2023. Blockstream, a Bitcoin infrastructure company, also announced Greenlight, a solution to offer secure self-custody options for Lightning transactions. Project lead Christian Decker claimed that Greenlight is “designed to let developers integrate Lightning in their apps seamlessly while granting users full exclusive control over their funds,” ensuring that the convenience of Lightning microtransactions is preserved even as a host of new security measures are used. As Blockstream is attempting to attract both private and institutional customers with this “Lightning-as-a-Service” model, it has even offered developers free access to on-demand nodes to develop applications on this protocol. 
In other words, the growth of the Lightning Network in nearly all metrics is clearly visible all around. Despite a bear market for Bitcoin and the plateauing of new Lightning Network nodes, this revolutionary protocol has grown tremendously. Counting more users and a substantial portion of all bitcoin transactions, the Lightning Network and its community are pushing forward at high speeds. Most importantly, as evidenced by the new applications that are released at a constant rate, Lightning enjoys an active and dynamic ecosystem of new developers to constantly expand on the project. It is this metric, more than any other, that can guarantee success. Bitcoin has built up its incredible reputation and staying power, the ability to bounce back from market downturns and government crackdowns, through the innovation of its worldwide community. And, as the numbers will plainly tell you, that community loves the Lightning Network.

River estimated that there are anywhere between 279k and 1.1 million users per month, a wide figure made complicated by the difficulty at measuring private transactions and those between two participants.
Furthermore, even as their data has suggested that the number of active nodes has plateaued since mid-2022, the Network’s actual capacity to process bitcoins has been steadily increasing all the same. River draws attention to several subtler factors of Lightning Network success in their study: for example, the fact that Bitcoin’s highest prices ever took place in 2021. During the period observed, they claim that “Google search volume for Bitcoin decreased by 45%, and the price decreased by 44%”, and yet still the Lightning Network has grown out of all proportion in the same time period! This suggests that more experienced users, those who remain invested in Bitcoin’s revolutionary economic model despite its setbacks, have been a key force in adopting this protocol.
Additionally, the report analyzed the types of transactions that 27% of their measured transactions were conducted in some unexpected “growth areas”, such as tipping on social media and streamers and also the gaming industry in general. Indeed, on the same day as this report’s release, gaming firm THNDR began a limited rollout of its new API, Clinch. It uses the Lightning Network to enable gamers worldwide a novel new access to the gambling industry: a series of games with Lightning-based wagers that can be played anywhere, instantaneously, for no fees with bets as low as one satoshi. Considering that increasing numbers of Lightning users have taken to such games in recent years, a success here could break into a multibillion dollar industry.

This is not even the only new application for the Lightning Network launched in mid-October 2023. Blockstream, a Bitcoin infrastructure company, also announced Greenlight, a solution to offer secure self-custody options for Lightning transactions. Project lead Christian Decker claimed that Greenlight is “designed to let developers integrate Lightning in their apps seamlessly while granting users full exclusive control over their funds,” ensuring that the convenience of Lightning microtransactions is preserved even as a host of new security measures are used. As Blockstream is attempting to attract both private and institutional customers with this “Lightning-as-a-Service” model, it has even offered developers free access to on-demand nodes to develop applications on this protocol. 
In other words, the growth of the Lightning Network in nearly all metrics is clearly visible all around. Despite a bear market for Bitcoin and the plateauing of new Lightning Network nodes, this revolutionary protocol has grown tremendously. Counting more users and a substantial portion of all bitcoin transactions, the Lightning Network and its community are pushing forward at high speeds. Most importantly, as evidenced by the new applications that are released at a constant rate, Lightning enjoys an active and dynamic ecosystem of new developers to constantly expand on the project. It is this metric, more than any other, that can guarantee success. Bitcoin has built up its incredible reputation and staying power, the ability to bounce back from market downturns and government crackdowns, through the innovation of its worldwide community. And, as the numbers will plainly tell you, that community loves the Lightning Network.

Bitcoin ETF Price Action Hints At $16 Billion Inflows For BTC, Report Breaks Down Scenario;"A recent report from an analyst, “Crypto Researcher,” dives directly into the implications of a Bitcoin ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) for the cryptocurrency’s price. The potential launch of this financial instrument has already impacted the nascent market, but this report expects a massive balance shift upon its approval in the US.  
According to the analyst, the spot Bitcoin ETF proposal filed by asset manager BlackRock will inevitably get approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As its CEO shows, the asset manager is betting on this launch.
Just yesterday, BlackRock’s top executive Larry Fink publicly defended Bitcoin and crypto. This interview coincided with speculation that the US regulator approved the Bitcoin ETF. These rumors were confirmed untruth by Fink and others.
However, BlackRock’s CEO saw the rally as a signal that institutions are increasingly interested in cryptocurrency. The rally was driven, according to Fink, by investors “fleeting” to Bitcoin as a “quality” asset.
In this scenario, where the Bitcoin ETF is imminently launched in the US, “Crypto Researcher” claims that crypto investors should focus on the amount of capital that will flow into this product. For example, when BlackRock launched its iShares Gold ETF, the product absorbed $25 billion in market capitalization.
The Gold ETF market is more significant, holding over $85 billion in capital. Ever since the launch of these financial products in the US, the underlying asset’s price has skyrocketed to new highs.
An additional factor comes into the picture with the current macroeconomic situation. Launching a Bitcoin ETF could combine with a shift in this landscape, propelling Bitcoin back into uncharted territory. The analyst stated:
As a recession looms in Europe and US inflation appears to be in check, the money printing machines will eventually be switched on again, which is when Bitcoin will thrive. No matter where you stand on this inflation/deflation question, having exposure to both might be a worthy hedge. It is fair to assume that 10-20% of those Gold ETF holdings would be switched to Bitcoin (…).
If this scenario continues, the Bitcoin ETF market could take over $16 billion in capital inflows. As seen in the chart below, the analyst used Tether (USDT) as a proxy to gauge the potential impact of these inflows.
For every $2 billion in inflows with USDT, the price of Bitcoin experienced a 4% rally. In other words, Bitcoin could soar above $37,500 if the ETF market injects $16 billion in capital.
Addressing yesterday’s speculation, the analyst said:
As the example shows, Bitcoin rallied +10% without an official statement by the SEC, based on an unconfirmed news source. In that case, the actual approval can have a more pronounced impact, and a +20-30% rally appears to be a reasonable assumption – which would imply $16-24 billion of Bitcoin ETF inflows.

Macro Guru Dan Tapiero Says Crypto Being Adopted at ‘Breakneck’ Speed, Highlights Trillion-Dollar Opportunity;"Macro guru and crypto fund manager Dan Tapiero says that the adoption of digital assets is happening quickly and there are no signs of it slowing down.
In a new interview with Coin Bureau host Guy Turner, Tapiero says that the crypto space has seen massive growth in the past four years alone.
“When I first had the idea for the [crypto] fund was the middle of 2019 and the total value in the space then was $300 billion. That was the value of all the cryptocurrency in the world and the value of all the equity. It’s an internal measure that we use. So it was $300 billion. At the peak 18 months ago, it had gone to $3.2 trillion. And today, we’re $1.7 trillion. So there’s $1.7 trillion of value in our world, which is unbelievable. 
Okay, it’s down half from the peak, but it’s up 5x from four years ago. And so, I just think that people don’t realize that adoption, as we always talked about it, institutional or retail adoption, is happening at pretty much a breakneck speed. Something that goes up 5x in four years, it’s like 100% a year. That’s pretty fast.” 
The trader says that there is huge potential for more growth in the crypto space, particularly in tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) on blockchains.
“Even this concept of tokenizing real-world assets, RWAs, which has been growing a little more in vogue in the last six months, we went from $100 million of assets tokenized to now $800 million in a few months. But it’s $800 million. 
There are hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of assets. And then you look at something like the stablecoin market, which literally three years ago was zero. And last year, in 2022, you had $8 trillion of stablecoins settled, $8 trillion. Now, what in the traditional world goes from zero to $8 trillion in three years?”
According to the trader, the crypto space is now growing at a faster rate than ever before.
“The reality is that the space is growing and morphing at a faster rate today than at any time since I’ve been involved: the number of innovations, the number of new ideas, new products, new use cases, the whole world of DeFi (decentralized finance).”

Bitcoin: $50K-$73K Range Foreseen Post Approval of Spot ETFs;"The excitement surrounding Bitcoin exchange-traded funds [ETFs] remains undiminished, despite their persistent delays. On the contrary, approval of these applications has sparked a surge in bullish wagers. CryptoQuant, a data analytics company, has more recently disclosed that if Bitcoin spot ETFs receive approval, BTC could become a $900 billion asset. Along with this,  the overall cryptocurrency market could expand by $1 trillion.
Presently, Bitcoin holds a market capitalization of $557 billion, with the leading cryptocurrency trading at $28,582.96. The total market capitalization currently stands at $1.09 trillion. The addition of another $1 trillion could potentially push it to the $2 trillion mark. 
In this context, CryptoQuant is actively considering that the institutional adoption seen in 2020–2021 resulted from institutions incorporating BTC into their balance sheets. The firm envisions that the upcoming trend might involve financial institutions granting their clients access to BTC through spot ETFs.
CryptoQuant suggests that if the entities seeking approval to list Bitcoin ETFs allocate 1% of their Assets Under Management [AUM] to these ETFs, it could introduce around $155 billion into the BTC market. This would account for nearly one-third of Bitcoin’s existing market capitalization. In the event of such a development, it could theoretically drive Bitcoin’s price to a range between $50,000 and $73,000.
Earlier this week, a false report claiming that BlackRock’s application had received approval caused a nearly 10% surge in the price of BTC. Consequently, the aforementioned forecast doesn’t seem entirely unattainable.

Numerous prominent financial institutions have submitted applications to introduce Bitcoin ETFs based on the spot market in the United States. Approvals for these ETFs are anticipated, with the latest expected date being March 2024. However, several conjectures regarding their approval have been surfacing. For instance, cryptocurrency analyst Miles Deutscher has disclosed a high likelihood of a Bitcoin spot ETF receiving approval in the coming 85 days.

BCH Price Analysis: Will BCH Cross Sellers Mark At $250?;"The post BCH Price Analysis: Will BCH Cross Sellers Mark At $250? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Sustaining a remarkable, bullish trend in 2023, the BCH price displays a remarkable growth of 135% year-to-date growth. With the ongoing Uptober season and the Blackrock ETF under review, the sentiments are on the verge of sparking a new hopium rally. 
The recovery rally increases the possibility of a breakout rally for Bitcoin Cash and the BCH price prediction of reaching $300 in 2023. 
The recent pullback from the $300 level leads to a sharp correction to the $180 support zone. Nevertheless, with the high volatility in September, the buyers were able to ride the volatility to give a bullish breakout and challenge the $250 mark. 
In the larger picture, the Bitcoin cash price action displays a positive bullish pattern that may soon cross the $300 mark. The bullish pattern is an inverted head-and-shoulder pattern with a neckline at the $250 resistance zone. 
Currently, the price action is forming the right shoulder of this pattern as it takes support from the 50-day EMA. The recent 7.29% growth last night leads to a bullish engulfing candle and completes a rounding bottom reversal, increasing the likelihood of a prolonged uptrend. 
Technical indicators:
MACD indicator: The MACD indicator displays a positive crossover on the verge as the MACD and signal lines converge. Therefore, the momentum indicators give a positive signal. 
EMA: The positive trend in the 50 and 200-day EMA certifies the ongoing bull run in BCH price. Moreover, the rising EMAs provide a dynamic cushion to absorb any sharp selling spree. 
As the overall market sentiments improve, the possibility of a bullish pattern breakout is increasing rapidly. The overhead resistance breakout of $250 will mark an entry point for sideline traders. The breakout rally is expected to cross the $300 mark and reach the $329 high. 
Conversely, a failure to sustain above the 50-day EMA will plunge the market value to the $180 support zone.

XRP Price Prediction – Chances Of Steep Decline If It Closes Below This Level;"XRP price is attempting a fresh increase from $0.4730 against the US Dollar. The price could climb toward $0.5320 unless there is a downside break below $0.4880.
After a steady decline, XRP found support near the $0.4730 zone. The price started a recovery wave above the $0.480 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
There was a move above the $0.4880 resistance. The bulls pushed it above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $0.5510 swing high to the $0.4730 low. Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $0.4915 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair.
However, the bears remained active above the $0.500 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $0.500 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.500 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5065 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours) or the 50% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $0.5510 swing high to the $0.4730 low.

Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com
A close above the $0.5065 level could send the price toward the $0.521 resistance. A successful break above the $0.521 resistance level might start a strong increase toward the $0.550 resistance. Any more gains might send XRP toward the $0.585 resistance.
If XRP fails to clear the $0.5065 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.488 zone.
The next major support is at $0.4730. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.4730 level, XRP price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.4320 support zone.
Technical Indicators
4-Hours MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.
4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $0.488, $0.473, and $0.432.
Major Resistance Levels – $0.5065, $0.5210, and $0.550.

On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.500 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5065 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours) or the 50% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $0.5510 swing high to the $0.4730 low.

A close above the $0.5065 level could send the price toward the $0.521 resistance. A successful break above the $0.521 resistance level might start a strong increase toward the $0.550 resistance. Any more gains might send XRP toward the $0.585 resistance.
If XRP fails to clear the $0.5065 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.488 zone.
The next major support is at $0.4730. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.4730 level, XRP price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.4320 support zone.

4-Hours MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.
4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

Dogecoin [DOGE] Price Prediction: October End 2023;"Similar to Shiba Inu’s pursuit of reaching the $0.01 mark, Dogecoin has been striving to attain the $1 threshold. However, these ambitions have frequently encountered obstacles. Yet, it appears that the OG meme coin is entering a more bullish phase. Dogecoin’s current performance shows positive aspects, outperforming Bitcoin [BTC], Cardano [ADA], and Ethereum [ETH] in selected metrics. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a notable 10.32% surge in daily active addresses for Dogecoin.
However, can this momentum alone drive Dogecoin to reach $1? Not quite. According to machine learning algorithms, it is expected that the meme coin will deviate from its bullish trend and experience a major decline as October comes to a close.

According to Changelly’s price prediction, Dogecoin is expected to end October on a predominantly bearish trajectory. Currently, DOGE is being traded at $0.058266, marking a daily decline of 1.6%. Additionally, it’s worth mentioning that over the past month, the meme coin has witnessed a notable decrease of 6.5%.
Dogecoin is projected to reach a lower level of $0.054196 on Oct. 30, which reflects a dip of 7.53% from its current price. Furthermore, on Oct. 31, DOGE is expected to decline by 9.32% to $0.053143. It is anticipated that the asset will remain within the $0.05 range and will not be able to reach $0.06.
However, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has provided a dose of optimism for the Dogecoin community through his recent price prediction, which indicates favorable signals on the meme coin’s price chart.
Notably, Martinez has pointed out that Dogecoin is currently “approaching the apex” of a “multi-year descending triangle formation.” Consequently, if the meme coin manages to achieve a weekly close above the $0.0835 threshold, it could potentially “initiate the start of a new DOGE bull run, possibly reaching $1,” as highlighted by the crypto expert.

Furthermore, on the flip side, Martinez advises the community to closely monitor the support level at $0.0482, as falling below this point could open the door to a new yearly low.

Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Odds Bolstered By Fresh SEC Insights;"In a significant twist to the spot Bitcoin ETF saga, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seemingly intensifying its communication with applicants, a development that stands out in the long history of the Bitcoin ETF application process. This move comes on the heels of fake news regarding BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF approval, adding to the momentum surrounding potential SEC acceptance.
Historically tight-lipped on Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC’s proactive outreach has been acknowledged by some major players in the investment world. Ark Invest, in collaboration with 21 Shares, became the pioneering applicant to revise its submission in direct response to the SEC’s feedback in recent days, as Bitcoinist reported.
Following their lead, other key players, including Fidelity, have made similar adjustments. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s noted ETF analyst, remarked via X, “Now Fidelity has filed an amended application. Three issuers down, six-ish to go.”
Diving deeper into the substance, Fidelity’s renewed application elucidates several pivotal components of its spot Bitcoin ETF. Among them are the intricacies of custody arrangements, the procedures around hard forks, how they determine valuation and pricing while adhering to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), comprehensive risk disclosures related to regulatory uncertainties, the energy consumption implications of Bitcoin mining, and potential risks linked to illicit transactions.
Scott Johnsson of Davis Polk weighed in on the trends he observed from the amendments: “The amendments thus far have been detailed in specifying custodial arrangements, explaining the mechanics around hard forks, clarifying the sources of valuation and pricing and their adherence to GAAP, and discussing the risk factors associated with regulatory uncertainties, energy-intensive nature of mining, and illicit transaction implications.”
He further speculated on the trajectory of these developments and predicted that it will be “most interesting” to see the next round of amendments, as it should be “more apparent what is actually being focused on by the SEC versus merely issuers enhancing their disclosures given that approval seems more plausible now.”
James Seyffart, another Bloomberg expert, responded to Johnson’s insights with his observation: “These amended applications are further evidence that potential spot Bitcoin ETF issuers are actively communicating with the SEC about the changes and amendments needed for potential SEC approval. It’s a positive sign, in my opinion. However, we can expect more amendments in the coming weeks and months. This appears to be a dynamic dialogue with feedback loops and responses. I’m keenly awaiting the SEC’s subsequent requests in these documents.”
Shedding further light on the matter, in a podcast session with Scott Melker, both Seyffart and Eric Balchunas dived deeper into the implications of these developments. Balchunas articulated, “There will be multiple at once. […] If it is January 10th, I bet we will hear about the approval in 2023.”
The momentum suggests that everything is aligning for a January launch. If the SEC doesn’t greenlight Ark’s ETF by this date, they’ll need to provide an entirely new rationale. But given their recent engagements with issuers, this doesn’t seem plausible.
“And so we think they’ll do the same thing as with Ether [Futures ETFs], accelerate the rest of them, move them up to Ark’s state and then let them go out in two rounds or on the same day whoever is ready or not,” Balchunas explained.
Given these developments, the Bitcoin and investment community is on the edge of their seats as they eagerly await the SEC’s next move on the spot Bitcoin ETF front. The recent proactive stance by the regulatory body has certainly given new glimmers of hope to those anticipating a favorable verdict.
At press time, BTC traded at $28,683, after facing resistance at the $29,000 mark during the Asian trading hours.

Crypto Exchanges Will Need To Register for Financial Services License Under New Australian Proposal;"The Australian government is floating a proposal that if implemented will require crypto exchanges to seek licensing from the country’s financial services and financial markets regulator to operate.
According to the proposal, a digital asset intermediary must obtain an Australian financial services license granted by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to “issue and deal in digital asset facilities.”
The proposal says that digital asset intermediaries holding assets with a value not exceeding $5 million AUD ($3.18 million) are exempt from the Australian financial services license requirements.
The proposal also ropes in crypto brokers and other dealers in the envisaged licensing regime for Australia.
“A person who deals in, or arranges for another person to use, a digital asset facility in the ordinary course of a business that is not primarily a financial services business, does not need to hold an Australian financial services license if:
(i) They are dealing in a digital asset facility provided by a licensed platform provider; and
(ii) the dealing does not involve digital assets that are financial products.”
With regard to the various forms of market misconduct such as “market manipulation, false trading and market rigging, wash sales, and fictitious transactions,” the proposal places the burden of fighting the vices on crypto exchanges.
According to the proposal, crypto exchanges will be required to “have and apply ‘listing criteria’ for any product made available for transactional functions on its platform” and ensure that digital asset transactions only occur after making sufficient disclosures on the particular token or tokens.

Bitcoin ETF Update: SEC’s Mysterious Stance on GBTC Sparks Speculation in Crypto Market;"The post Bitcoin ETF Update: SEC’s Mysterious Stance on GBTC Sparks Speculation in Crypto Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The crypto market went wild when a fake SEC approval for Blackrock’s Bitcoin ETF sent BTC to $30K! This frenzy highlights the massive demand for regulated Bitcoin. But SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s mysterious stance on GBTC adds an extra twist. Everyone’s wondering, “What’s the SEC up to?” Gensler’s careful words about GBTC have left us in suspense! 
Following the SEC’s unsuccessful appeal of its August court loss regarding Grayscale’s bid to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), Grayscale and the crypto industry are contemplating their next moves.
SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s recent interview with Bloomberg has sparked speculation and scrutiny over his guarded stance regarding the status of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and other spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Legal experts, notably financial lawyer Scott Johnsson, chimed in on the implications of a recent DC Circuit ruling and its potential impact on GBTC. 
“So the tricky question is how does this order to vacate by the DC Circuit actually impact GBTC?” 
Johnsson highlights the nuanced interpretation of “vacate” about the SEC’s statutory timelines, suggesting that without a clear disapproval order, GBTC could be “deemed approved,” albeit amidst legal complexity. 
Grayscale’s legal team has conveyed this interpretation to the SEC, urging recognition of their previous application. With the uncertain legal landscape, Johnsson speculates that Grayscale may wield this argument as leverage in ongoing negotiations with the SEC, even though a smoother path might involve refinement.
On a controversial note, Gensler’s responses in the interview, characterized as “cagey,” refrained from providing direct insights into the matter. While he acknowledged the diligent review of multiple filings by agency staff, he avoided divulging specific details. Gensler emphasized his reluctance to judge outcomes, indicating a deliberate and cautious approach prematurely. Notably, he avoided outlining the SEC’s next steps following last month’s court decision, adding to the uncertainty surrounding GBTC’s status and the broader realm of spot Bitcoin ETFs.
The twist in the story came with Fidelity, the asset management giant, submitting an amendment to its proposed spot Bitcoin ETF, the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing outlines measures to protect customers’ Bitcoin in custody accounts and address risks associated with the uncertain regulatory waters of digital assets, among other considerations. 
Moreover, Fidelity joins Ark Invest and Invesco in amending their spot Bitcoin ETF filings. Invesco resubmitted on October 11, with Ark Invest following suit a day later. These moves suggest a continued dialogue between potential ETF providers and the SEC, generating bullish sentiment among traders and market observers.

He clarified that his ETH transactions are primarily donations, not personal sales, and that he has not “sold” ETH for personal gain since 2018.

Echoes of ’07: 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield rises to pre-crisis levels;"The bond market is exhibiting significant destruction, as reflected by the current state of the U.S. 10Y note. Recently, the yield on the note surged above 4.843%, a high unseen since 2007 and just 17bps from the 5% mark. This high-yield period precedes the creation of Bitcoin by several years, illustrating just how long ago it was.
The rise in U.S. yields follows a considerable unexpected surge in U.S. retail sales, where the month-over-month increase reached 0.7%, more than double the initial projection of 0.3%.
This surge signifies a strong sell-off in the bond market, evident in the performance of long-duration bonds such as the TLT, a 20-year+ treasury bond. The TLT opened at a notably low level of 84.89, a mark only replicated a scant few times in 2004 and 2006.
This paints a stark picture of the upheaval bonds have endured due to the most rapid tightening of interest rates witnessed in four decades. The bond market is in a precarious position due to the intricate inverse relationship between bonds and yields, a dynamic that becomes even more critical in the current climate of swiftly rising interest rates.

Fed Governor Says a CBDC in the US Has ‘Unclear’ Use Case and Presents Significant Risks;"Federal Reserve Bank governor Michelle Bowman says that the use case for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the US remains unclear.
In a new roundtable speech at Harvard, Bowman says that there may be alternatives to CBDCs that already solve the same issues that a digital dollar purports to address.
“It is quite possible that other proposed solutions may address many or all of the problems that a CBDC would address, but in a more effective and efficient way. 
Further, the potential benefits of a U.S. CBDC remain unclear, and the introduction of a U.S. CBDC could pose significant risks and tradeoffs for the financial system. These risks and tradeoffs include potential unintended consequences for the U.S. banking system and considerable consumer privacy concerns.”
According to Bowman, stablecoins, or dollar-pegged crypto assets, could be viable alternatives to CBDCs, but she says they also pose risks to the US financial system as they are less regulated and have been unstable in the past. Bowman cautions that CBDCs and stablecoins should both be approached with wariness.
“Another alternative to traditional forms of money and payment, or to a CBDC, is stablecoins. This form of payment emerged primarily to support the trading of crypto-assets but increasingly has been proposed as an alternative to traditional payments and as a store of value. 
Stablecoins purport to have convertibility one-for-one with the dollar, but in practice have been less secure, less stable, and less regulated than traditional forms of money. Digital assets used as an alternative form of money and payment, including stablecoins, could pose risks to consumers and the U.S. banking system. 
Therefore, it is important to understand risks and tradeoffs associated with digital assets and new arrangements used for banking and payments. While I support responsible innovation that benefits consumers, I caution against solutions that could disrupt and disintermediate the banking system, potentially harming consumers and contributing to broader financial stability risks.”

Canadian police warn Calgary residents of rising crypto scams;"Calgary, Alberta, Canada, is currently grappling with a surge in cryptocurrency-related scams, prompting local law enforcement to issue a targeted warning to its residents. Victims in Calgary have collectively lost more than $22.5 million to various scams within the cryptocurrency space so far this year. Reports from Canadian officials indicate that the number of reported crypto scams in 2023 has significantly risen. In contrast to 2022, where residents reported losses totaling $14 million across 321 scams in 12 months, the figures for 2023 have already reached 340 reported scams.
Canadian authorities have also warned that these numbers may significantly underrepresent the actual extent of the issue. Calgary, a cosmopolitan city and historically the heart of Canada’s oil industry, was recently ranked as the third most livable city in the world by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). However, its residents are now contending with the escalating threat of cryptocurrency scams. The most common forms of scams in this region are investment scams. These scams typically involve perpetrators promising victims higher returns on their investments in cryptocurrency in exchange for an upfront payment.
It is a red flag when scammers demand full payment before delivering on their promises. One notorious example includes phishing videos impersonating Bitcoin billionaire Michael Saylor, where victims are convinced to send their Bitcoin to the scammer’s wallet in the hope of doubling their holdings. In January 2022, one victim fell for this scheme, sending $1.1 million in Bitcoin to the scam address. In addition to investment scams, authorities are cautioning residents about individuals online who promise significant returns in the cryptocurrency markets. They also advise people to be wary of those they encounter online.
Scammers on social media dating apps also mention crypto investments, and these messages are often indicators of fraudulent activity. The rise in cryptocurrency-related scams is not unique to Calgary; it is a global issue. According to Chainalysis, scams constitute a significant portion of the volume of cryptocurrency-related crimes, which also include hacks, activities on the darknet, and ransomware attacks. However, Chainalysis’s 2023 crypto mid-year update suggests that global cryptocurrency crime is on the decline compared to the previous year. Unfortunately, this positive trend does not seem to apply to Calgary.
A survey conducted in June 2023 by Toronto Metropolitan University sheds light on the scope of the problem. The survey found that one-third of digital asset owners in Canada have fallen victim to cryptocurrency scams, underscoring the need for increased vigilance and awareness among cryptocurrency users. Aside from scams, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) issued a warning in July regarding a different type of threat. Some Canadians reported that their cryptocurrencies were stolen directly from their homes by individuals posing as delivery persons or authorities, further highlighting the creativity and audacity of cryptocurrency scammers.
Residents of Calgary, Alberta, are grappling with a surge in cryptocurrency-related scams, resulting in substantial financial losses. These scams come in various forms, with investment scams being the most common. Local authorities have issued warnings to help residents protect themselves from falling victim to these fraudulent schemes. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, users must remain cautious, exercise due diligence, and be aware of the potential risks associated with this emerging financial technology.

Bitcoin data shows a growing trend of dormancy as hodlers remain strong;"The movement, or lack thereof, of Bitcoin in the market can provide significant insights into the behavior of investors and the overall health of the market. When there’s little movement of Bitcoin, it often indicates a robust holding sentiment among investors.
Long-term holders, i.e., addresses that have held onto their assets for longer than 155 days, play a pivotal role in shaping the market dynamics. Their behavior is crucial to monitor as it can signal market confidence, potential price movements, and overall market stability.
As of recent data, the amount of BTC held by long-term holders has been on a steady rise since the beginning of the year. It has now reached an all-time high of over 14.85 million BTC.
To put this into perspective, 76.1% of the circulating supply has not been transacted in the last 5 months or more.
Another metric that sheds light on this phenomenon is the ‘hodler net position change.’ This metric provides insights into the market’s coin dormancy, showing the change in the part of Bitcoin’s supply held by entities that are the least likely to sell. It offers a sustained regime of coin dormancy, with over 50,000 BTC per month being “vaulted” by hodlers.
Vaulting refers to storing or holding onto coins without intending to transact or selling them in the near future. This behavior indicates a tightening supply and a widespread reluctance among hodlers to transact.
The increasing trend of hodling and the dormancy of coins suggest a few things. First, there’s a strong sentiment of confidence among long-term holders in the future value of Bitcoin. This tightening supply can lead to increased demand, potentially driving up the price of Bitcoin. However, it also means that the market is currently strapped for liquidity, making it harder for new investors to buy or for current holders to sell.

Ethereum Vs Bitcoin Now Trades At 15-Month Low! Are Bulls Losing Confidence In ETH Price?;"The post Ethereum Vs Bitcoin Now Trades At 15-Month Low! Are Bulls Losing Confidence In ETH Price? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Last week, the market maintained a stable condition, presenting investors with chances to accumulate more following a minor sell-off. This morning started with a buying demand, particularly for leading assets: Bitcoin and Ethereum, as they began to recapture their previous strength. However, despite the ongoing uptick in Ethereum’s price, there’s potential for investor confidence to decline, given that the ETHBTC ratio is hitting its lowest in 15 months – a level not seen since the Ethereum’s Proof of Stake (PoS) transition.
Setting aside the recent pump and dump game in Bitcoin’s value due to inaccurate news from Cointelegraph about the SEC approving Blackrock’s spot BTC ETF, the ETHBTC ratio is hovering at its lowest in 15 months. This represents the most significant dip since the event of Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) last year.
The ETHBTC chart has been on a notable downtrend in recent months, indicating Ethereum’s lost traction compared to Bitcoin. The ratio currently stands at 0.056, suggesting a growing investor inclination towards Bitcoin over Ethereum for massive returns. 
For example, Bitcoin-focused investment funds have seen an influx of $246 million from the beginning of the year until October 6, as per data from CoinShares. Conversely, during this timeframe, Ethereum funds have experienced a decline, with capital outflows amounting to $104 million.
Following the recent volatility in the ETH price, over $20 million worth of positions were liquidated and 50% of them were in long, suggesting an increased fear following Cointelegraph’s fake news. Moreover, there’s a decreased whale interest as the large transactions dropped from 1.3 million ETH to just 600K ETH today.
This analysis is made without considering the recent pump and dump situation on ETH price.
Over the last 24 hours, ETH price experienced a bullish push as it attempted to surge above $1,600. However, the increasing selling pressure from STHs is creating a barrier, strengthening the immediate resistance level. As of writing, ETH price trades at $1,578, surging over 1.6% from yesterday’s rate.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is flashing signs of a positive divergence, suggesting that the bearish momentum might be losing strength. The bulls are attempting to send the price towards the EMA200 trend line, where the bears are expected to put up a robust defense.
Should the price sharply decline from the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), it would indicate that the bears still maintain control. In such a scenario, the ETH price could potentially decline below $1,521.
To avoid this decline, the bulls must push the price above the moving averages. This could lead the price to climb to $1,660, although at this point, the bulls may once again encounter strong selling pressure from the bears.

Lido Finance Fees Exploding, Should Comparatively Low Revenue Be A Concern?;"The total amount of Ethereum (ETH) staked on Lido Finance, one of the many liquidity staking protocols available, has risen steadily over the past few years. Surprisingly, revenue accrued by the platform (compared to staking rewards distributed) remains comparatively low. 
Looking at Token Terminal data shared on October 19, the blockchain analytic platform observed that while staking rewards paid, counted as “fees” by Lido Finance grew from less than $10 million in early 2021 to over $60 million in June 2023, revenue has grown at a much slower pace. To illustrate, Lido Finance’s average revenue is roughly less than $5 million during this period.
Overall, Lido Finance is a liquidity staking protocol that supports the staking of multiple proof-of-stake (PoS) coins like Ethereum (ETH) without necessarily locking them up. Users can concurrently earn staking rewards while accessing their hard-earned ETH–or any other coin supported. 
The protocol issues another derivative, stETH, for every ETH staked to achieve this. This token can be freely traded on exchanges. It can even be used as collateral for users keen on taking trustless loans on supported platforms.
Ethereum recently shifted to be a proof-of-stake blockchain to be greener and conserve the environment. This transition was a boon for protocols that supported the first smart contract platform to confirm transactions and remain secure, especially after the activation of Shanghai in April 2023. 
The Shanghai upgrade allowed Ethereum validators to withdraw their staked ETH for the first time, permitting them to use alternatives, of which Lido Finance, looking at total value locked (TVL), was preferred. As of October 19, Lido Finance had a TVL of $13.913 billion, most of it being assets on Ethereum. 
Lido Finance makes staking more accessible to everyone while concurrently enhancing liquidity. However, the revenue generated appears low versus the amount of staking rewards distributed to stakers, most of whom are from Ethereum. Part of the revenue the network generates is also distributed to LDO holders and node operators. Whether the liquidity staking protocol plans to increase the 10% fee charged to increase revenue earned remains to be seen.
Presently, there are concerns that Lido Finance’s role on Ethereum could lead to centralization. Ethereum has been accused of being “centralized,” mainly in how it is built. Critics assert that the reliance on its co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, for endorsement and guidance could slow down development in the future.

Crypto Scams Costs Canadian Investors $22.5 Million;"Canadian investors residing in Calgary, Alberta, have fallen victim to crypto scams. This has resulted in a substantial loss of $22.5 million within the current year. The surge in fraudulent activities has prompted provincial officials to issue a specific warning to residents. They were urged to exercise caution when dealing with employment scams, romance scams, and other deceptive practices associated with digital currencies. This article will delve into the concerning uptick in crypto scams in Canada. It will also provide insights on how investors can protect themselves in this age of digital finance.
Reports originating from Alberta have unveiled a significant increase in crypto scams, with 340 cases reported since the year’s commencement. This represents a notable surge from the previous year, 2022. During this period, residents reported losses of $14 million across 321 scams over a span of 12 months. It’s crucial to acknowledge that authorities believe these figures merely scratch the surface. This is because many victims may refrain from reporting their financial losses.
The police department in Calgary has been diligent in addressing this issue. They emphasize that although crypto serves legitimate purposes, its unregulated nature has made it an attractive tool for scammers engaged in a variety of fraudulent activities.

One of the most prevalent forms of crypto-related fraud involves investment scams. Scammers promise victims substantial returns, contingent upon an initial financial contribution. Law enforcement agencies stress that legitimate investments do not demand full upfront payments, highlighting such requests as a warning sign.
For example, the well-known Michael Saylor phishing videos feature fraudsters posing as the Bitcoin billionaire, pledging to double the Bitcoin holdings of victims in exchange for transferring their BTC to the scammer’s wallet. In January 2022, an individual was duped into sending $1.1 million in BTC to a scam address as part of this scheme.
The police have also issued cautions against individuals offering unrealistic returns within the crypto markets. This is along with individuals on social media and dating apps who mention crypto investments, which often serve as indicators of potential scams.
According to Chainalysis, crypto scams constitute a substantial portion of crypto-related crimes. This encompasses activities like hacks, darknet markets, and ransomware attacks. However, their mid-year update for 2023 indicates a decrease in global crypto-related crime, a trend not mirrored in Calgary.

A survey conducted by Toronto Metropolitan University in June found that one-third of digital asset owners in Canada have fallen prey to crypto scams. In addition to scams, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police [RCMP] issued a warning in July regarding instances of Canadians having their crypto stolen directly from their homes by individuals masquerading as delivery personnel or figures of authority.

Canadian investors residing in Calgary, Alberta, have fallen victim to crypto scams. This has resulted in a substantial loss of $22.5 million within the current year. The surge in fraudulent activities has prompted provincial officials to issue a specific warning to residents. They were urged to exercise caution when dealing with employment scams, romance scams, and other deceptive practices associated with digital currencies. This article will delve into the concerning uptick in crypto scams in Canada. It will also provide insights on how investors can protect themselves in this age of digital finance.
Reports originating from Alberta have unveiled a significant increase in crypto scams, with 340 cases reported since the year’s commencement. This represents a notable surge from the previous year, 2022. During this period, residents reported losses of $14 million across 321 scams over a span of 12 months. It’s crucial to acknowledge that authorities believe these figures merely scratch the surface. This is because many victims may refrain from reporting their financial losses.

How much will Spot Bitcoin ETF approval add to the crypto market cap? $1 trillion, perhaps?;"According to CryptoQuant,  an additional $155 billion is to be added to the crypto’s market cap if the Bitcoin ETFs are approved by the United States Securities Exchange Commission. Additionally,  the crypto market could grow over $900 billion, peaking at $1 trillion in the long run, if the approval goes through.  
The crypto market has long awaited Bitcoin’s Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) approval, which could revolutionize the entire digital world. This would provide institutional investors, together with retail traders, a regulated and easily accessible infrastructure to invest in Bitcoin. Such events could have a positive impact on all crypto investors. 
Future-based ETFs track Bitcoin’s price through derivatives contracts. On the other hand, spot Bitcoin ETF directly holds the underlying digital currency, and this distinction is essential to investors. It provides direct exposure to BTC price movement and, as such, gives real-time analysis of the market movements. It eliminates the complexities associated with futures contracts.  
CryptoQuant, the popular data-driven crypto analysis firm, has commented on the impact spot Bitcoin ETF would bring to the digital realm. It could attract a wave of new investors who have been in line waiting for approval but hesitated due to regulatory uncertainty. 
The report argues that the potential gain from the approval could be greater than the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) funds recorded in the last bull run. Keeping in mind that the GBTC crypto fund is the largest in the world, with $16.7 billion, the potential gains could be massively understated. 
If GBTC converts to an ETF, it will be very bearish for Bitcoin. It means that billions of previously trapped Bitcoin will finally be released back into the market.
Additionally, CryptoQuant says that if the issuers apply to list ETFs and put 1% in the Assets Under Management (AUM), approximately $155 billion could flow into the market. If the approval takes place, the BTC price could overlap its all-time high, reaching $73,000. 
Even according to Bitcoin’s data history, recent bull runs have grown its capitalization by 3 to 5 times. In simpler terms, if $1 enters the Bitcoin market, its capitalization would be increased by $3 to $5. Consider the recent scenario when the fake post about the SEC’s approval of the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF brought a huge price movement that recorded an increase of its price close to the $30,000 mark. 
At the time of the writing, BTC price stands at $26,732.79 per (BTC / USD) with a current market cap of $ 521.60B. The coins’ 24-hour trading volume is at $12.10B with a circulating supply of 19.51M. 
According to CoinGecko, the global crypto market cap today stands at $1.13 Trillion, with a -0.3% change in the last 24 hours. Total crypto trading volume in the last day is at $39.2 Billion. BTC dominance is at 49.2%, and Ethereum dominance is at 16.8%. 
According to the head of research and strategy at Matrixport via Telegram broadcast, “Nobody will dare to short BTC now for the foreseeable future. Even if this Cointelegraph news was false, BTC can still grind higher in anticipation of the approval.”
An actual approval could raise the price through the roof and better solidify its position as the top crypto in the market. The mere prospect of the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF has already been awaited and fueled by positive market sentiments. 
This has also assisted in boosting investor confidence in the digital asset. It has also created a sense of legitimacy for digital assets. Such an approval could propel the entire digital space. 
The potential inflow from the spot ETF could bring about a substantial capital influx. Institutional investors, including asset managers and hedge funds, have continuously shown their concern for digital currencies. Due to the strict compliance requirements and regulatory challenges, the spot Bitcoin ETF would be a useful tool in providing a more familiar framework that gains exposure to the crypto market. 
Should Bitcoin’s market cap greatly increase, other cryptocurrencies could also face an increase in value. The digital currency market is majorly driven by retail investors and a number of institutional players. The introduction of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds could open a floodgate of more institutional capital. In turn, this would largely increase Bitcoin’s liquidity and drive its price upwards.

BlackRock Amends Spot Bitcoin ETF Filing;"Asset manager BlackRock filed an amended prospectus for its spot Bitcoin ETF application with the US SEC. 
BlackRock has submitted an amended prospectus for its spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
BlackRock becomes the third applicant to file amendments to its spot Bitcoin ETF applications this week, after Ark Invest and Fidelity. 
In its amendments, the asset manager acknowledged serious competition in the race for a Bitcoin spot ETF approval and provided further details on the product’s pricing and reporting mechanisms. 
BlackRock initially filed its “iShares Bitcoin Trust” ETF application in June. According to its filing, the Nasdaq stock exchange with the SEC, the custodian of the fund’s bitcoin will be Coinbase Custody Trust Company, while the Bank of New York Mellon would custody the Trust’s cash holdings. 
Blackrock is currently in the race with seven other applicants to receive the first spot Bitcoin ETF approval, and its competition includes Grayscale, the largest Bitcoin trust fund. Grayscale recently made waves with a courtroom win against the SEC after the agency rejected its application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to a spot Bitcoin ETF. The securities agency said that it would not challenge the ruling. 
The court was highly critical of the SEC’s decision not to allow Grayscale to convert its Bitcoin trust into a spot ETF.  
BlackRock also included amendments to the pricing details of the ETF in its financial statements. The updated filing now provides specific information regarding how the pricing source is determined in the Trust’s periodic financial statements. It also includes accounting specifications such as “Level 1 input according to ASC Topic 820.”

Chainlink Whales Moved Around $150M In LINK Before Latest Surge: Data;"On-chain data shows the Chainlink whales showed some high activity right before the latest surge in the cryptocurrency took place.
As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, whales and institutional investors have shown an increasing amount of activity recently. The relevant indicator is the “large transactions volume” from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, which keeps track of the aggregate volume of Chainlink transactions larger than $100,000.
Generally, the whales and institutional entities are the only investors capable of shifting such a large amount with a single transaction. These holders carry large balances in their wallets, making them influential on the network.
When the value of this metric is high, it means that these humongous investors are moving around large amounts right now. Such a trend implies that these investors are participating in some trading activity.
However, this metric alone can’t discern exactly what kind of activity it is, as both selling and buying transactions appear the same on the blockchain and count towards this volume.
On the other hand, when the indicator has low values, it suggests that the whales and institutional players aren’t interested in the cryptocurrency as they aren’t making too many moves. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Chainlink large transaction volume over the past few weeks:

As displayed in the above graph, the Chainlink large transactions volume registered a spike recently, implying that the whales had been moving many tokens across the network.
At the peak of this spike, the whales transferred around 20.38 million LINK within 24 hours. This stack would be worth over USD 150 million at the current exchange rate.
It’s uncertain why these humongous holders suddenly showed so much activity, but perhaps the surrounding price action could hint at it. This spike was seen a few days back, and since then, Chainlink has observed some net uptrend.
Thus, the timing of the transactions could suggest two likely possibilities. These large investors bought in anticipation of this rally (perhaps due to some inside information), or their buying is why the price surge found its appropriate fuel in the first place.
Either way, it’s a positive sign that the whales and institutional investors have recently participated in potential accumulation activity. In the coming days, this metric can be the one to keep an eye on, as further activity from these holders could signal that more volatile price action may be ahead.
Once again, though, any future spikes could arise from both buying and selling, so they won’t necessarily be a bullish signal for Chainlink like this latest one turned out to be.
At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading around $0.74, up more than 3% in the past week.

Central Banks to probe Crypto: Opportunity or overreach?;"Central banks are increasingly turning their attention to the crypto space, getting deeper into this industry that once sat on the periphery of their vision. 
But as they seek clarity in a world known for its opacity, we must ask: are they genuinely looking for answers, or is this just another power grab in an ever-changing financial landscape? 
At the heart of this new curiosity lies the Bank for International Settlements’ (BIS) Project Atlas report. Supported by heavyweight central banks from Europe such as Deutsche Bundesbank and De Nederlandsche Bank, the project seems innocuous. 
Their stated goal is to unearth more information on crypto-related data like cross-border Bitcoin movements. Yet, the broader implications are far-reaching. This isn’t just about Bitcoin. 
This dive signifies that the titans of traditional finance are acknowledging the undeniable force of crypto assets and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. 
They are, as they should, realizing that this isn’t just a passing phase; it’s an evolving financial ecosystem that has the potential to redefine how we look at finance.
But there’s a hint of skepticism. Concerns about the lack of transparency in this ecosystem are ever-present. Finding out which countries house crypto exchanges remains a challenge. 
Couple this with the recent vulnerabilities exposed in DeFi projects, and it’s evident that the traditional financial behemoths are wary. 
The notable crash of the Terra (Luna) protocol and the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange underscore the uncertainties of the unregulated market. 
The burning questions are: does crypto truly have an issue with data transparency? And if so, why is it so difficult to determine cross-border flows?
It’s no secret; central banks have always been eager to understand the assets their residents hold internationally. After all, during financial downturns, overseas assets can provide a much-needed buffer. 
Hence, they’re keen to gauge the amount and purpose of crypto being transferred out of their domains. Clemens Graf von Luckner, previously with the World Bank, points out that a substantial stock of crypto savings overseas could be seen as a buffer against financial distress.
However, due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, coupled with the pseudonymity of its transactions, gathering this data has proven to be a challenge. Unlike the fiat world where information flows systematically, in crypto, the structure is more peer-to-peer.
So, what’s triggering this newfound interest? The simple answer: the crypto industry’s sheer size. With a whopping valuation of over $1 trillion, central banks can’t afford to ignore it any longer. Furthermore, they’re aware of the impact these assets can have on traditional fiat currencies.
Currently, central banks source their crypto data from private analytic firms like Chainalysis. Yet, this method isn’t foolproof. The decentralized nature of transactions makes it challenging to pinpoint exact end destinations. 
However, the future isn’t entirely bleak. Tools for tracking chains are on the rise, and there’s a growing trend among major crypto exchanges to disclose more data voluntarily.
Would the journey become smoother if crypto exchanges took the initiative? Certainly. By providing clear insights, they can instill more confidence in central banks. Furthermore, it would aid in forging a harmonious regulatory framework beneficial for all.
However, it’s crucial to address the factors that contribute to the prevailing opacity in the crypto world. Whether it’s the ethos of a decentralized protocol, business interests like tax evasion, or other reasons, transparency can only be achieved if these are tackled head-on.
While some may argue that Europe’s focus on crypto regulation is a regional issue, recent advancements suggest otherwise. As the crypto industry gains momentum, the pressure is mounting to bridge the information gap. 
If cryptocurrencies are to thrive, they need to be assimilated into the mainstream financial framework. Only through integration can they avoid being relegated to the economic outskirts.

Meanwhile, in the realm of luxury automotives, Ferrari breaks traditional barriers by announcing its acceptance of cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and XRP for its high-end vehicles, a move anticipated to be replicated in Europe soon. However, the corporate world treads with caution, as many blue-chip entities shy away from cryptocurrency, citing concerns like volatility and regulatory complexities. Parallelly, global financial giant Jefferies sounds the alarm on potential ramifications on the U.S. dollar's prominence, suggesting potential advantages for both gold and Bitcoin investors.
Amidst these broader movements, individual cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR), Ripple (XRP), Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), and Chainlink (LINK) each tell their own captivating story. For those keen on understanding Monero's future prospects, there's an encompassing Monero (XMR) price prediction on StealthEX that you might find enlightening, which may be useful before we look at shorter-term prospects.
Monero (XMR) has always worn its privacy-first ethos on its sleeve. Born out of a Bytecoin fork, it has actively innovated with features like ring signatures, stealth addresses, and bulletproofs, ensuring anonymity isn't just an option—it's a guarantee. Diving into its latest GUI software release v0.18.3.1, it's commendable to see Monero extending support to macOS ARM, making it accessible to a broader set of users. Not to mention, the software updates to Qt and p2pool, alongside UI enhancements, further consolidate its robustness. 
But here's the twist: Monero's staunch commitment to CPU mining raises eyebrows. On one side, it's a noble pursuit—prioritizing decentralization, resisting the ASIC takeover, and favoring the 'little guy'. This approach reduces e-waste, ensures that consensus isn't monopolized by a hardware giant, and optimizes energy usage. But there's the flip side: concerns about the network's vulnerability due to a lower hashrate. Would ASIC integration boost the market cap or expedite transactions? Possibly, but it could also undercut the coin's value and centralize security, doing more harm than good.

Regarding the short-term outlook, the Monero (XMR) price analysis indicates a slight bullish momentum, with the current price range between $139.3 and $152. This narrow band suggests that XMR is in a consolidation phase at the moment. 
The first support level is pegged at $131.9, which means that if the price were to fall, this is a level where a significant amount of buying might be expected to kick in and possibly push the price back up. If, however, this level fails to hold, the next substantial support is at $119.2, suggesting that the asset could find further buying interest around this mark.
On the other hand, resistance levels indicate where potential selling pressure could set in. For Monero, the initial resistance is marked at $157.3. If the price manages to breach this level due to strong bullish momentum, the next significant resistance to watch out for is at the $170 mark. This level could prove to be a harder nut to crack, as it might attract increased selling, potentially pushing the price down.
The 200-day Moving Average stands at $152.9, which is just slightly below the current price. This may indicate that XMR is currently at or near its long-term average price, indicating that the market sentiment may be at a pivotal point.
The 10-day moving average at $153.4, almost in line with the 200-day MA, implies that there isn't much short-term volatility. If the price can sustain above both moving averages, it could signal a positive trend for Monero (XMR).
In sum, Monero's story is a blend of innovative ideas and idealistic pursuits. While its dedication to user privacy and decentralization is laudable, the CPU mining debate is a double-edged sword. As with most things crypto, keep informed and think about broader market dynamics.
Ripple's XRP Ledger, a decentralized public blockchain designed for business applications, is witnessing significant growth, nearing a milestone of 5 million accounts. This uptick in accounts indicates growing interest and trust in Ripple's infrastructure. Recent data from Whale Alert, a blockchain monitoring service, highlighted a transfer of 30,200,000 XRP to the EU-based crypto exchange, Bitstamp. 
Further analysis revealed that the transaction originated from a wallet associated with Ripple Labs, implying the company's continued active involvement in the market. Over the past two months, similar transfers of around 29-30 million XRP have been made to Bitstamp and Bitso exchanges, both of which collaborate with Ripple on its payment service. Previously known as On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) and now rebranded as ""Ripple Payments,"" this service utilizes XRP for swift, cost-effective cross-border payments, offering a competitive edge over traditional bank transfers by ensuring faster transaction times, even on weekends, without the need for prepaid accounts in destination countries.
In addition, with Ripple Labs consistently winning its legal battles, the future may look brighter than most expect.
Currently wavering between $0.4668 and $0.5561, Ripple has witnessed slight recovery recently.

If XRP maintains or exceeds its current upper range and surpasses both the 10-day Moving Average at $0.4965 and the 200-day Moving Average at $0.5282, this would suggest positive momentum. It would indicate a strong bullish sentiment in the short term as well as a potential longer-term uptrend.
If the price can break past the first resistance level at $0.5972, it will be a significant bullish sign. This breakout might attract more buyers, pushing the price further up.
If XRP can maintain its momentum and breach the $0.6865 resistance level, it could signal a robust bullish trend with potential for even higher price levels.
A bearish signal can be perceived when XRP's price drops and stays below the 10-day Moving Average ($0.4965) as well as approaches or dips below the 200-day Moving Average ($0.5282). This could suggest a short-term decline or potential shift in the longer-term trend.
A dip below the first support level at $0.4186 would further solidify the bearish sentiment, indicating that sellers are in control. If the bearish momentum continues and XRP reaches or breaches the second support level at $0.3293, it could suggest a more extended downtrend and might require monitoring for further decline. To get a more comprehensive picture, it might be a good idea to consider a longer-term XRP price prediction.
Litecoin has solidified its standing as one of the most resilient and long-standing cryptocurrencies, boasting 12 continuous years of operation without any downtime. This consistency is emblematic of the network's robust architecture and its capacity to weather various challenges in the crypto ecosystem. 
The diverse spectrum of the Litecoin community is remarkable, as evidenced by its 458 millionaires and 82 substantial accounts, each holding upwards of $10 million in LTC. On the other end, the 2.3 million unique addresses with merely $1 worth of LTC depict a broad, decentralized user base, suggesting widespread adoption and interest, ranging from small-scale individual holders to significant investors. Such a broad distribution of holdings indicates the currency's accessibility and appeal to a varied demographic, further strengthening its position in the market.
At present, Litecoin (LTC) is oscillating within the $59.66 to $70.33 bracket. Observing the moving averages, the 10-day Moving Average is pegged at $62.88, notably lower than the 200-day Moving Average, which sits at $81.71.

This suggests that Litecoin has been on a downward trajectory in the medium to long term. From a bullish perspective, should LTC overcome the immediate resistance at $74.68, it could pave the way for a rally towards the next significant resistance mark at $85.35. Such a move would also bring the price closer to the 200-day MA, hinting at potential trend reversal. 
Conversely, in a bearish scenario, if LTC drops below its first support level of $53.35, it may further descend towards the more profound support at $42.69. The gap between the current price and the 200-day MA indicates the need for a strong catalyst or momentum shift to bring the asset back into a long-term bullish zone.
Stellar's network is strategically designed to foster asset tokenization, facilitating the creation, issuance, and management of digital assets that mirror real-world assets (RWAs). Stellar's commitment to optimization for asset issuance is evident in its continuous endeavors to enhance native platform features. 
The recent revelation at Meridian 2023 by Cheesecake Labs CEO, Marcelo Gracietti, adds another feather to Stellar's cap. The enhanced Stellar Asset Sandbox is set to serve as a cornerstone for institutions eager to delve into the world of asset tokenization on the Stellar network. The no-code required feature of the sandbox not only lowers the entry barrier for businesses but also offers them a robust testnet environment. Here, they can experiment with creating, issuing, and managing digital equivalents of real-world financial assets, hinting at Stellar's vision for widespread asset digitalization and its readiness to offer necessary tools and infrastructure.
Currently, Stellar (XLM) is trading within the range of $0.1040 to $0.1275. The 200-day Moving Average (MA) stands at $0.1099, slightly above its 10-day MA of $0.1059, suggesting that the asset might be witnessing slight bullish momentum in the short-term. On the bullish side, if XLM manages to break above the initial resistance at $0.1428, it could target the next significant resistance at $0.1664, potentially indicating a more pronounced bullish run.

However, on the bearish front, should the asset fall below its first support level at $0.0956, further downward pressure could drive its price towards the more formidable support level at $0.0720. 
The close alignment of XLM's price with the 10-day and 200-day MAs signifies a crucial juncture, and any significant departure from these averages could set the tone for XLM's near-term price trajectory.
Stellar's advancements in asset tokenization and the developments unveiled at Meridian 2023 spell potential growth and diversification for the network.
Chainlink (LINK) has recently experienced considerable attention, primarily due to its association with the ever-growing trend of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The emphasis on Chainlink being possibly the ""safest choice"" for investors seeking exposure to this domain provides a significant boost to the project's fundamental outlook. K33 Research's David Zimmerman's acknowledgment of Chainlink's value proposition further reinforces this narrative. Chainlink's integration as an essential bridge between blockchains and real-world applications through its state-of-the-art oracles and its broad spectrum of collaborations bolsters its position in the crypto market. While Zimmerman concedes that LINK might not be the top performer in terms of ROI, its strategic positioning in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology places it as a strong contender for sustained growth and adoption.
Currently, Chainlink (LINK) is trading within the $6.52 to $9.05 range. Taking into consideration the moving averages, the 10-day Moving Average is at $7.39, slightly above the 200-day Moving Average of $6.76, which indicates a short-term bullish sentiment.

From a bullish viewpoint, if LINK can surpass its immediate resistance at $9.91, it sets the stage for potential upward momentum towards the next major resistance at $12.44. Such a rally could be spurred by the positive fundamental news and increased institutional activity, as recently witnessed.
On the bearish side, if LINK faces a downturn and breaks below its primary support level of $4.87, it might further decline to its next crucial support at $2.35. The proximity of the 10-day and 200-day MAs suggests a critical juncture for LINK, and any substantial news or market shifts could decisively influence its direction.

GBTC Discount Continues to Shrink as Bitcoin ETFs Move Closer to Reality;"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) – the world’s largest Bitcoin fund – reached its lowest point in 22 months last Friday. The decline in the discount has sparked optimism as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States are moving closer to becoming a reality.
This comes as the SEC passed the deadline to appeal against Grayscale’s attempt to convert its GBTC fund into a spot bitcoin ETF.
According to the latest data by YCharts, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares were traded at a 15.87% discount on October 13th, compared to the trust’s net asset value (NAV), a level not seen since December 2021, only a month after Bitcoin’s price peaked near $69,000.
In fact, the discount on GBTC started to decrease when BlackRock and several other financial institutions submitted applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs around mid-June. The discount, which was at 44% on June 15, reduced to 26.7% in a span of just three weeks, and it has continued to narrow since then.
The “Discount to NAV” is a percentage that gauges the extent to which a mutual fund or ETF is trading at a value lower than its net asset value (NAV). This metric serves as a means to monitor the deviation at which a security is trading in relation to its actual intrinsic worth.
The data depicts that this discount has been consistently narrowing since it hit a record low of almost 50% during the depths of the bear market in December of the previous year.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had until October 13th to appeal its dispute with Grayscale Investments over establishing a spot Bitcoin ETF. While a failure to appeal does not mean the regulator is ready to approve one.
Now that the deadline has expired, it is probable that the court will reaffirm its directive for the SEC to reassess Grayscale’s request to transform its GBTC product into a spot Bitcoin ETF. However, the financial regulator might still come up with alternative grounds for denial.
However, industry observers are optimistic about a potential approval. Bloomberg ETF analysts also increased the odds of approval to 90% after Ark Invest and 21Shares updated its spot Bitcoin ETF prospectus requested by the SEC.

Roblox Expands Payment Options with XRP Integration via BitPay;"In a significant move that underscores the growing embrace of cryptocurrency in the gaming world, Roblox, the immensely popular online gaming platform boasting over 214 million monthly active users, has integrated XRP as a payment method. This development was announced today by BitPay, a prominent cryptocurrency payment processing service, on their official BitPay on X (formerly Twitter) account.
Roblox’s decision to accept XRP is a strategic step aimed at expanding the options for in-game payments. The company responsible for handling in-game payments in Roblox, which is based in Los Angeles and known as Xsolla, has now integrated XRP as a payment choice. BitPay, a trusted partner in the cryptocurrency payment space, will be responsible for facilitating a seamless connection between Roblox users and their crypto wallets.
News Alert @Xsolla now accepts XRP(@Ripple) with BitPay as a payment method for their games, such as @Smitegame and @Roblox. You can use your favorite cryptocurrency to buy, play, and enjoy gaming like never before.#BitPay #crypto #Smite #Xsolla #Roblox pic.twitter.com/NAg2EyOVGM
Roblox has gained immense popularity over the years, with 66.1 million daily active users enjoying the platform’s diverse games and virtual experiences. A remarkable 43.96% of these users are under the age of 13, highlighting the platform’s appeal to a broad demographic. In the first quarter of 2023, Roblox users spent a staggering $773.8 million on in-game purchases, further emphasizing the platform’s financial significance.
Xsolla, the company behind the integration of XRP, has been actively pushing the boundaries of crypto adoption within the gaming industry. In August 2022, Xsolla formed strategic partnerships with the automated crypto management platform Coinchange Financials Inc. and the live-streaming social Web3 platform TradeZing, with the aim of developing a non-fungible tokens (NFTs) payment solution. This venture was part of a broader effort to explore new revenue streams and innovative solutions for the gaming ecosystem.
Further underlining their commitment to the crypto sphere, in August 2023, Xsolla joined forces with Crypto.com, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange and payment platform. This collaboration resulted in the integration of Crypto.com’s checkout solution into Xsolla’s Pay Station platform, making it easier for gamers to make payments with cryptocurrencies.
The partnership between Xsolla and BitPay dates back to 2014 when the service began accepting Bitcoin (BTC) payments. This early adoption of cryptocurrency paved the way for further innovations, ultimately leading to the integration of XRP as a payment method on Roblox. In September 2023, BitPay and Xsolla introduced PayPal USD (PYUSD) payments, further expanding the payment options available to merchants and consumers.
The integration of Ripple (XRP) on Roblox marks a significant milestone in the gaming industry’s journey toward greater cryptocurrency adoption. By embracing cryptocurrencies like XRP, Roblox is poised to offer its users a more diverse and secure payment experience, while also demonstrating the industry’s commitment to evolving with the times. As the gaming world continues to explore the potential of cryptocurrencies, it is evident that partnerships like this will play a vital role in shaping the future of in-game transactions.

Bitcoin Miners Sail Through Over 400 Difficulty Changes With 13 More Anticipated Before the Halving;"In 189 days or 27,000 blocks, Bitcoin’s block reward is anticipated to halve. Within this period, around 13 adjustments in Bitcoin’s difficulty are expected. The network’s difficulty indicates the complexity of finding a hash below a particular target, essentially representing the computational power needed to mine a block. This self-regulation, embedded in Bitcoin’s code, ensures steady block times, predictable issuance, and network security.
Bitcoin’s difficulty saw a 6.47% increase this week, surpassing the 61 trillion mark at block height 812,448. This marked the cryptocurrency’s 403rd difficulty epoch, some of which included retargets with no change. In basic terms, Bitcoin’s difficulty measures the challenge of identifying a new block relative to its easiest potential level.
This measure, denoted by a specific number, is adjusted by the Bitcoin protocol every 2,016 blocks — approximately every two weeks — based on the time taken by miners to discover those 2,016 blocks. The difficulty adjustment ensures a consistent discovery of new blocks by miners, regardless of the number of miners in the network.
Notably, during its initial phase at block height 2,016, the difficulty didn’t alter due to a lack of mining activity. The justification for an increase or decrease hinges on the time required to process 2,016 blocks. Ideally, blocks should surface every ten minutes, totaling approximately two weeks for 2,016 blocks.
If these blocks are discovered quicker than this ten-minute benchmark and the block discovery rate accelerates, the difficulty escalates. Conversely, if it lags, the difficulty diminishes. After 19 different epochs of 2,016 blocks, at block height 40,320, Bitcoin’s difficulty rose for the first time by 100% on February 14, 2010.
The February 2010 adjustment marked Bitcoin’s second most significant change, surpassed only by a staggering 302.22% leap at block height 68,544 on July 16, 2010. Just three days before this monumental shift, the difficulty had surged at block height 66,528, recording the third-largest jump with an ascent of 95.65%.
Fast forward to May 26, 2011, and the fourth most pronounced hike transpired, with a 78.15% uptick at block height 127,008. Not far behind, the fifth most substantial surge in difficulty occurred on June 24, 2011, at block height 133,056, showcasing a 57.27% increment. Some significant upward shifts were witnessed at block 52,416, block 86,688, and block 124,992.
On the flip side, July 3, 2021 bore witness to the steepest negative shift in Bitcoin’s history at block height 689,472, plummeting by 27.94%. Following closely, October 30, 2011, saw the second sharpest dip at block height 151,200, registering an 18.03% decline. The difficulty nosedived by 16.05% at block height 655,200, decreased by 15.97% at block 685,440, and took a 15.95% tumble at block height 622,944. Rounding out the top eight downward adjustments are block 552,384, block 149,184, and block 681,408.
Bitcoin’s difficulty will persistently adapt, responding to the ebb and flow of miners within its network. To date, miners have amped up their hashrate, pushing it by an impressive 0.68 exahash per second (EH/s) daily. Remarkably, despite 15 difficulty increases in 2023, the hashrate still surged, tacking on an extra 194 EH/s in under a year.

Here’s Why Loom Price Is Down Over 70% in The Last 4 Days;"TL;DR

Loom Network is an interoperability chain in production since 2018. It provides scalability and usability for DApps, with support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Chain, and TRON.
Here’s why LOOM price is down by so much this week.
The project gained some notoriety over the last month when LOOM price began to soar on Binance and Korean exchange UpBit.
For months leading up to mid-September, LOOM traded range-bound between $0.04 and $0.06. Then, suddenly, on September 16, LOOM price began to fly up the chart in a frenzy that started on UpBit and spread to Binance.
The drastic price increase made LOOM a trending crypto on CoinMarketCap.
An October 12th post noted that, “Loom Network has made its way among the top 100 cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization.”
So what caused the bull run on Loom Network tokens in the first place and the subsequent 70% selloff this week?
According to FXStreet, it may have been Korean traders pumping the coin for a quick profit.
That’s how it looks after the LOOM price bubble from $0.046 to an ATH of $0.343 popped on Sunday, October 15:
“Meanwhile, the LOOM token ranks as the leading bag on the Korean exchange Upbit, spurring concern considering the region’s traders are infamous for pump-and-dump schemes.”
After LOOM tokens fell some 70%, anyone who bought in near the top and didn’t make a hasty exit got left holding a bag on UpBit or Binance.
The LOOM pump didn’t last longer than a month because that was enough time for the market to make a serious evaluation of the Loom Network.
On-chain data from Santiment revealed:
“…this surge lacked a foundation in strong fundamentals, with on-chain data showing that developer activity on the Loom Network has slowed over the past few years.”
Adding to the confusion and mayhem, just as LOOM price reached its ATH, $3.5 billion software giant Atlassian announced a $975 million acquisition of a video messaging company with the same name.
Pump-and-dump trading is common on Korean exchanges. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Yung Ju has noted in the past that:
“It happens because South Korea has very strict capital controls, blocking arbitrage opportunities between global exchanges.”

BTC and Gold To Go Up ‘A Lot’ if Fed Pivot Triggers Severe Recession and Stagflation: Economist Peter St Onge;"Heritage Foundation think tank economist Peter St Onge says that economic stagnation and high inflation could positively impact Bitcoin (BTC) and gold.
In a new interview on Kitco News, the economist says that periods of stagflation have traditionally “been very, very good for hard assets.”
A period of stagflation is characterized by high or rising inflation rates, slowing economic growth, and high unemployment levels.
“I would be surprised if Bitcoin didn’t go up a lot if we get into this sort of a stagflationary trap where we’re following that 1970s pattern that was kind of like a Camel’s hump (because it went up once, came down and came back up again).”
On how high Bitcoin could appreciate, Peter St Onge says,
“Gold went up six-fold in the 1970s – actually during the entire decade I think it went more than that, silver was up seven-fold. And so at that point, it’s kind of an interesting parlor game to ask – well, Bitcoin usually moves a lot more than gold and so if we get this sort of second wind on the stagflation and gold soars, what happens to Bitcoin?
I’m very excited to see what exactly happens there but I would be surprised unless Bitcoin went up a lot as well.”
According to the Heritage Foundation economist, the Federal Reserve’s actions will be the telltale signs of the economic outlook.
“If we get to a point where inflation is still going yet the Fed starts cutting, that is where that death cross comes in. That’s where you would get really concerned because you would say, ‘Wait, so the inflation job is not done but you guys just gave up on the tools that they use to fight inflation?’. So that basically tells you, ‘Okay, so you’re afraid of something bigger?’ 
And specifically, what they would be afraid of is some sort of massive, maybe not a depression but a severe recession. Something like the 2008 crisis.”

Roblox Now Supports XRP As A Payment Method;"In a big win for XRP adoption, the cryptocurrency is now accepted as a payment option on the mega-popular gaming platform Roblox.
According to an announcement by the cryptocurrency payment processor firm BitPay, Xsolla now supports XRP via BitPay. Xsolla is a video game commerce company that offers a variety of services to game developers.
Over the years, the firm has grown into a known name in the industry, as it boasts clients like Ubisoft, Epic Games, and Twitch. The company is also currently a payment services provider for the super popular Roblox.
Initially released back in 2006, Roblox is an online gaming platform that allows users to create and host their own games, and play the games made by other users.
At first, the game was only available on Windows PC but has slowly rolled out on other platforms in the past few years. The PlayStation 4 (PS4) and PlayStation 5 (PS5) releases of Roblox happened just a week ago.
The game’s popularity blew up in the second half of the 2010 decade and only accelerated during the COVID years, as lockdowns boosted the gaming industry as a whole.
While Roblox has always been free-to-play, microtransactions are possible through the in-game currency Robux. With Xsolla’s partnership with BitPay, users can now buy Robux using XRP.
Given the massive popularity of Roblox, this is certainly good news for the adoption of the cryptocurrency. The asset can also be used on other games that Xsolla provides payment services for, like the multiplayer battle arena game SMITE.
The cryptocurrency market observed a rapid surge yesterday when an announcement of a Bitcoin spot ETF being approved surfaced. This news, however, turned out to be fake and the assets rolled back their gains in response.
XRP also mimicked this same pump-and-dump pattern, as the below chart displays:

At the peak of this rally, XRP had breached the $0.51 level, but with the retrace, the coin has come back down to $0.49. Interestingly, while Bitcoin has seen net profits during the past day even after the ETF debacle, XRP is in the red for the same period.
The asset has also performed poorly against other top coins when looking at the weekly returns. The below table shows how the coin has performed against its peers in the top coins by market cap list recently.

As is visible above, XRP has seen losses of 1% in the past week, while BNB and Solana have enjoyed profits in the same period. At present, the token is the fifth-largest in the market, but if its bad performance continues, it could lose its spot to the stablecoin USDC.

Bitcoin Changing Hands Cycle Signals Bear Market Recovery, Glassnode Study Shows;"New research shows bitcoin investors are rotating from long-term holders to short-term speculators, indicating the cryptocurrency market is recovering from the lengthy bear market.
A recent report by the onchain analytics firm Glassnode examines how bitcoin (BTC) changes hands between investors over time. The study tracks the ebb and flow of coins moving from long-term holders who accumulated bitcoin during the bear market, to short-term speculators trying to profit on price swings.
Glassnode utilizes a metric called “realized capital” to measure the total amount paid historically to acquire all existing bitcoins. This offers a view into when coins last moved between investors. Glassnode then segments the bitcoin supply into “age bands” showing the distribution of dormant coins held for various time periods.
“During market uptrends older coins are spent and transferred from long-term holders to newer investors,” the report states. “During market downtrends, speculators lose interest and gradually transfer coins to longer-term holders.”

The report identifies coins held for 1-2 years as a key long-term holder cohort. This group’s holdings peak during bear market bottoms as conviction buyers accumulate. In contrast, bitcoins held less than a month represent short-term speculators. Their share of the bitcoin supply surges during bull markets as new money flows in.
By comparing the holdings of each group, Glassnode’s models show where the market sits in its cycle. The current structure resembles the recovery phase after a major bear market bottom, similar to 2016 and 2019. Bitcoin’s price has rebounded from lows, but long-term holders still control over 80% of the supply.
“The bitcoin supply remains strongly dominated by the HODLer cohort, with a super-majority of coins now being older than 6-months,” the report concludes.
In addition to tracking coin age, Glassnode also models the profitability of short and long-term holders based on their average cost basis. This gauges the financial incentive to sell versus hold at different price levels. Here again, the firm’s models indicate the market may have entered an early bullish phase where long-term holders are in profit, but short-term traders are near break-even.

New research shows bitcoin investors are rotating from long-term holders to short-term speculators, indicating the cryptocurrency market is recovering from the lengthy bear market.
A recent report by the onchain analytics firm Glassnode examines how bitcoin (BTC) changes hands between investors over time. The study tracks the ebb and flow of coins moving from long-term holders who accumulated bitcoin during the bear market, to short-term speculators trying to profit on price swings.

Great Awakenings — Dormant 2012 Bitcoin Wallet’s $5.7M Spend Linked to October’s Initial 2012 Transfer;"On October 19, 2023, a dormant bitcoin address from 2012 sprang to life at block height 812,946, moving 200 BTC worth $5.74 million for the first time in nearly 11 years. This activity coincides with a recent surge of transfers from 2012 addresses, which began in early September.
On Thursday, another 2012 dormant bitcoin address was activated, transferring 200 BTC valued at $5.74 million. The address “1DabG” originated on November 1, 2012, when BTC was priced at $11.20 per unit, meaning the wallet’s initial value was $2,240.
Btcparser.com first noticed the transaction, which garnered a low privacy rating from Blockchair’s privacy tool. The 2012 transaction received an 11 out of 100, flagging three vulnerabilities: matched addresses, co-spending, and round values. To date, seven 2012 transactions have been recorded in October.
Last month saw a total of 19 transfers from 2012. The most recent 2012 transaction this month occurred on October 12, 2023, relocating 110 BTC. The address “1AVeQ,” originating on January 31, 2012, moved 100 BTC at block height 811,900. Soon after, the “1Agnu” address, established on September 30, 2012, executed a 10 BTC transfer at block height 812,168.
Before these transactions, notable 2012 transfers happened on October 9, and an unusual batch of 2014 transfers took place three days earlier. On October 6, 86 wallets from 2014 relocated 860 BTC, totaling $24 million, across various block heights. The 200 BTC shifted on Thursday was dispatched to the address “1NaoX“, which now possesses 404 BTC, equivalent to $11.62 million.
The mysterious address, 1NaoX, is distinct, having held 1,116 BTC over its existence and transferring 712 bitcoin. This address also received the first 2012 transfer of the month on October 6, 2023. That specific transaction moved 200 BTC from a 2012 address created on October 26, 2012, with that specific BTC now also located in 1NaoX. This means that several of October’s enigmatic 2012 transactions stemmed from the same owner.
What do you think about the 2012 bitcoin address waking up after all these years? Why do you think old holders are moving coins right now? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.

Whale loses $50k in minutes due to fake Bitcoin ETF news;"A significant misstep cost a cryptocurrency whale nearly $50,000 after falling victim to fake news regarding a Bitcoin Spot ETF. The investor hastily bought 20.5 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) for 613,201 USDC, only to sell at a loss of 563,970 USDC. This financial blunder occurred within a mere ten-minute window, highlighting the volatility and sensitivity of the crypto market to news, even when unverified.
Cointelegraph, a prominent source in the crypto news space, erroneously reported the SEC’s approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Consequently, this information set off a buying frenzy among investors, pushing Bitcoin’s price to an impressive $30,000. However, the bubble burst when BlackRock clarified that the news was false, causing the value to dip to $28,000.
The market’s frantic reaction underscores the influence of FOMO – the fear of missing out. Investors, driven by the urgency to capitalize on what appeared to be lucrative news, faced substantial financial repercussions. Such rapid shifts signify the market’s speculative nature and the enormous impact of news on investor behavior.
This incident, detailed by Look On-Chain, illustrates the risks tied to reactive trading in the cryptocurrency realm. The whale’s quick decision to invest heavily in WBTC, prompted by the false news, backfired significantly. Moreover, the rapid loss of $49,000 showcases the harsh reality of hasty, uninformed investment decisions. It serves as a reminder of the need for comprehensive analysis and the dangers of reliance on unconfirmed news.
Besides the immediate financial loss, this episode highlights deeper issues in the crypto news industry. The spread of misinformation is not just a trivial occurrence but a significant disruptor with the potential to unsettle markets. It emphasizes news outlets’ need to uphold stringent fact-checking protocols to maintain credibility.

BlackRock spot bitcoin ETF approval could catapult BTC to $56,000 – Matrixport;"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price could surge to as high as $56,000 if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves BlackRock’s application for a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), per an Oct. 19 research note by Matrixport shared with CryptoSlate.
The prediction is based on the projection that the U.S. registered investor advisor (RIA) community overseeing around $5 trillion in assets would allocate 1% of their holdings into BTC, which could usher in as much as $50 billion for the industry.
A more conservative estimate by the crypto platform predicted that the top cryptocurrency’s value could jump to $42,000 if the asset witnessed a sizeable inflow between $12 billion to $24 billion from 10-20% of precious metal ETF investors who are looking to diversify their portfolios through a Bitcoin ETF.
The prediction is coming on the heels of a similar one made by crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, which wrote that a spot BTC ETF approval would push the market capitalization of the flagship asset to $900 billion. In comparison, the broader crypto market could grow by $1 trillion.
Per CryptoQuant’s prediction, BTC’s price might surge to a range of $50,000 to $73,000 if the ETF applicants allocate a mere 1% of their Assets Under Management (AUM) to these funds.
CryptoQuant argued that the influx of capital from spot ETFs could substantially surpass the capital inflow experienced by Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) during the previous bull market. According to the firm, the initial stage of institutional adoption saw these firms integrate BTC into their balance sheets. However, the subsequent phase might involve financial institutions facilitating client access to the asset via spot ETFs.
These firms’ predictions align with the market reaction to a false report about a spot BTC approval. Following the news, BTC momentarily jumped to $30,000 before retracing to its current value.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the market reaction was “an example of the pent-up interest in crypto” and evidence of a “flight to quality.”
This view was also shared by several market observers who believe that a spot BTC ETF approval would push the asset’s value to new highs.

Tesla Q3 2023 Earning Report: How Much Bitcoin Tesla Holds?;"The post Tesla Q3 2023 Earning Report: How Much Bitcoin Tesla Holds? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
According to Tesla’s recently released third-quarter earnings report, the company didn’t complete any Bitcoin (BTC) sales in the previous three months.  This marks the company’s fifth consecutive quarter without any bitcoin sales. 
The Q3 2023 Report states that as of September 30th, Tesla held about 9,720 BTC, presently worth about $275.6 million. 
BTC was not mentioned in the Q3 report, indicating no digital currency conversion to fiat cash during the third quarter. If the company had taken any aggressive steps toward a selloff, it may have finally communicated its profitability and cash balance, and the company would have disclosed this. 
According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Tesla’s initial excursion into Bitcoin began in early 2021 with a $1.5 billion investment. The Elon Musk-owned business specifically purchased 43,000 units of the top digital asset by market capitalization at an estimated average cost of roughly $34,000. 
This move by Tesla was seen as a significant endorsement of Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and led to a surge in the cryptocurrency’s price. However, it also raised concerns about the company’s exposure to the volatile nature of the crypto market. 
Interestingly, this was also when the company started taking BTC as payment for its cars and other goods.
Tesla (TSLA), a manufacturer of electric vehicles, didn’t acquire or sell any bitcoins in Q2 2023 for the fourth consecutive quarter. 
After the second quarter, when Tesla stunned some investors by selling $936 million worth of bitcoin, or almost 75% of its entire holdings, to raise money, the value of its digital assets remained at $218 million. 
Since the bitcoin price stayed about the same after the second and third quarters at just under $20,000, Tesla did not record any impairment charges to the value of its holdings.
The absence of Bitcoin sales aligns with Tesla’s decision to halt accepting Bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles earlier this year due to environmental concerns. Despite this, the company focuses on increasing its holdings of digital assets and exploring more sustainable alternatives for cryptocurrency transactions.

Benjamin Cowen Warns Majority of Altcoins Will Never See New All-Time Highs Again Amid ‘Serious Declines’;"A widely followed crypto analyst is issuing a warning that most altcoins are in the midst of severe downtrends that will ultimately keep them below their all-time highs forever.
In a new video update, crypto trader Benjamin Cowen tells his 787,000 YouTube subscribers that most altcoins currently find themselves in “serious declines” that are being overlooked due to Bitcoin’s (BTC) relative resilience.
Cowen also notes that if Bitcoin were to decline, it would crush altcoins even worse.
“A lot of altcoins in the top 100 that are in pretty serious declines right now and a lot of people are completely ignoring it… The only reason people are ignoring it is because Bitcoin’s doing okay so it’s easy to discount [altcoins]… 
If you want exposure to the cryptoverse in the pre-halving year, Bitcoin can often offer you a decent amount of exposure to the upside while also minimizing your downside risk in the altcoin market. Some people think that that means that Bitcoin can’t go down – it can. 
I mean it went down in the second half of 2019, it even went down in the early phase of the halving year last cycle, so it can go down. It’s just that if it does go down it’s likely going to take the altcoin market with it.”
According to Cowen, very few altcoins that exist right now will ever hit new all-time highs again.
“I think that as a whole the altcoin market will recover. The issue is not ‘will the altcoin market recover?’ 
In my mind, it’s ‘will the altcoins that people are [dollar cost averaging], will those recover?’ And there might be one out of 10 or one out of 50 or one out of 100 that go on to put in new all-time highs but a lot of them can just go away.”
Cowen goes on to note that the next bull market could be sparked by a massive capitulation event for BTC that rinses out weak hands before springing to the upside.
“Even Bitcoin will probably bend the knee and we’ll have to figure out how low the secondary scare goes before we really get that move into sort of a more sustained bull market. 
There’s one interesting thing to look at with Bitcoin in the last two cycles and that [is] what really kickstarted the bull market… The real move to all-time highs did not come until [a] massive capitulation wick.”
Bitcoin is trading for $27,927 at time of writing.

Ripple May Be Preparing For an IPO, Job Listing Suggests;"Ripple has posted a job opening for the role of ‘Shareholder Communications Senior Manager.’ The job is listed for New York and Miami in the U.S. and for London, U.K. The job posting has led many to believe that the company may be preparing to go public. The opening in question involves a direct line of communication with shareholders, which is associated with a publicly traded company. 
As per the post, the person will “be responsible for the communications and relationship management strategy/execution for key groups of existing and prospective investors, current shareholders, and financial analysts.”

As per the New York opening, the individual will receive a salary between $143,792—$179,740 USD.
Many XRP proponents believe that the job posting is a hint that Ripple may be preparing to go public very soon. Moreover, many executives at the company have suggested on multiple occasions that the firm could go public. However, they have always refrained from giving any tentative time frame. 
Many have suggested that a Ripple IPO (Initial Public Offering) could help skyrocket XRP’s price. Some have even suggested a 20 times surge for the token’s price, hitting $10 overnight. The company will most likely earn massively on share sales if an IPO were to take place.

However, we do not have any confirmation from the company whether they will actually go public or not. The firm recently had a milestone partial victory against the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), which led to a sudden surge in XRP’s price. Coupling that with an IPO will most likely bring forth another bull run for the fifth-largest crypto by market cap.

Binance Japan — death knell or savior for the nation’s smaller crypto exchanges?;"When Binance Japan began trading on Aug. 1, it immediately offered 34 coins. That’s less than 10% of the total number of different cryptocurrencies listed on Binance’s global exchange, the world’s largest. But for Japan, the number is significant. It puts the new Binance Japan platform at the top of the national pile in terms of variety for crypto traders.
While that’s good news for the Japanese consumer and for Binance — under legal and regulatory fire in various locations across the world, including the U.S., the U.K. and Europe — it’s bad news for the plethora of small cryptocurrency exchanges that make up Japan’s own bloated crypto trading market.
In Japan, “if you want access to the most coins, now you need to go to Binance,” said Norbert Gehrke, a former Wall Street banker and founder of the Japan FinTech Observer newsletter, in an online note. “Everyone else (i.e., the smaller exchanges outside bitFlyer, bitbank, Coincheck, …) are screwed anyway and many should fold.”
As of Aug. 31, when the list was last updated, there were 29 cryptocurrency exchanges registered with Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA). The number of tokens listed by each exchange varies considerably. But a number of Japan’s smaller exchanges offer as few as one to five tokens, with Bitcoin and Ethereum generally featuring alongside a smattering of other major altcoins such as XRP, Matic and ADA.
The global crypto downturn has been unkind to exchanges around the world, particularly since the collapse of U.S.-founded exchange FTX in November of last year. Investor sentiment has soured, with an estimated US$2 trillion wiped off a once US$3 trillion market over the course of the past 18 months.
And while Japan’s bigger crypto exchanges remain globally competitive — bitFlyer, Coincheck and bitbank often rank inside the world’s top 25 exchanges in terms of trade volume — smaller exchanges, already struggling over a lack of liquidity and an inability to differentiate themselves from their peers, are faring far worse.

Some started life two to three years ago when Japan’s near-zero interest rates and an explosion of venture capital interest in crypto meant funding for projects was cheap and readily available. “The volumes were high, the prices were high,” said Gehrke. “Why not give it a shot?” 
But now, amid a period of extended crypto winter, Binance’s official arrival on Japanese shores — plus the attendant fanfare that goes with it — has only accelerated their decline. “Not only are volumes down, but prices are down,” said Gehrke. “Commission rates are also down significantly. I just can’t see them surviving.”
Assuming the strongest and the fittest do make it through the current bear market cull of crypto businesses, how many cryptocurrency exchanges does Japan — a country with a notoriously low tolerance for high risk investments at the best of times — actually need?
“I’ll be generous and say Japan could do with three to five,” said Gehrke.
“Buying and selling cryptocurrencies just isn’t profitable anymore,” said the chief executive officer of one small Japanese exchange. “Of course, if there were millions of customers, things might be different.” 
For now, however, business is so bad that the CEO asked not to include their name or the name of their company in this article for fear of things getting worse. Binance’s re-engagement with Japan, they said, could have a lot of positives for struggling exchanges, if just as a way of “brightening up” the market and restoring lost interest among investors. 
On the flip side, they said, Binance is such a big name and arrives in Japan on the back of so much bad press that, if something goes wrong, it could be “very bad” for the industry. “The situation is pretty high risk,” they said.
Binance Global is registered with a holding company in the Cayman Islands. Officially operating in 45 different countries — although reportedly available in far more — the exchange’s website claims it has over 150 million users worldwide, enjoying a daily transaction volume of US$65 billion. But its relationship with Japan is complicated. It previously received two separate reprimands from the FSA in 2018 and 2021 for operating as an unregistered online exchange.
In November last year, Binance fast-tracked its official entry into the country. It bought the Sakura Exchange BitCoin platform and transferred that exchange’s Osaka-region registration over to the Tokyo capital region, forming Binance Japan KK. The move is part of an industry-wide expansion effort toward the Asia Pacific, where recent regulatory action and a favorable political climate in places like Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan have opened the region up as a crypto growth market at a time of increasing U.S. opposition to the industry. 
Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has referred to nationwide adoption of Web3 — a new phase of the internet built on decentralized blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) — as a key socioeconomic growth strategy. Pro-crypto government figures and industry advocates routinely point to the strength of Japanese regulation as reason for foreign investment by foreign firms, now including Binance, in Japan’s Web3 industry. 
“It is likely that Binance attempting to create a new exchange in Japan would have taken years if it ever got somewhere,” said Mark Karpeles, former CEO of the collapsed Tokyo-based crypto exchange Mt. Gox. “Taking over an existing exchange gives them a shortcut into this very closed market.” 
The ease with which Binance was absolved of past run-ins with the FSA in order to get a license prompted some Japanese exchanges to call out a double standard. There is a feeling, said Tokyo-based fintech lawyer So Sato, that Binance’s fast and loose approach to the rules has allowed it to amass huge sums of money, pushing it to the front of the line as the world’s largest crypto exchange. 
“Some of their rivals feel that they were able to get a license here using that money,” Sato said.
The FSA, when asked about Binance’s re-entry into Japan, acknowledged that it had warned the company about operating as an unregistered exchange in the past. But a spokesperson for the regulator said that it had no reason or, indeed, authority to prevent the purchase of Sakura Exchange BitCoin as a way for Binance to re-engage with Japan, this time as a registered entity. 
Full steam ahead then for Binance Japan, as national director Takeshi Chino and his newly assembled team work through the process of transferring Japanese Binance Global customers over from the international platform to its domestic counterpart. Or not quite, given that Binance Global and its leadership structure, including CZ — whose alleged role in the FTX collapse has seen his actions come under the microscope — remain under intense regulatory and legal scrutiny elsewhere. 
In the U.S., both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have charged Binance with operating as an illegal exchange. The U.S. Department of Justice is also reportedly preparing an investigation into violations of international Russia sanctions. 
Elsewhere, criminal investigations into Binance’s operations are ongoing in Australia, France and, most recently, Brazil, while regulatory issues in Canada and a host of EU countries have seen the country beat a hasty retreat from those jurisdictions. On Monday, Binance said it will stop accepting new U.K.-based customers in compliance with the country’s new rules on overseas crypto promotions.
Asked if Binance Japan users should be worried about Binance Global’s legal trevails overseas, Sato said that existing regulation should protect Japanese investors in the event of an existential risk to operations. “If we assume that Binance Japan is obeying Japanese regulations by keeping 100% of Japanese customer assets in a cold wallet, the situation would be similar to the FTX collapse,” he said. 
On that occasion, regulations ringfenced Japanese FTX investors from the catastrophic losses incurred by crypto traders in other jurisdictions as the exchange folded. “Even if Binance Global went bankrupt, I think Japanese customer assets would be protected. Of course there will be some effect, such as a two or three month delay in withdrawals, as there was in the FTX case. But the assets themselves will be protected,” Sato said. 
High profile hacks on Mt. Gox in 2014 and fellow Japanese exchange Coincheck in 2018 led to the cumulative loss of billions of dollars worth of crypto at today’s valuations. In the aftermath, authorities came down hard on the industry, incorporating crypto assets into the regulations of its other financial systems from 2020. Those regulations require heavy investment in customer security and compliance.
The rigidity of regulation has led some international exchanges to question Japan’s viability as a profitable cryptocurrency market. U.S.-based exchange Kraken — where Takeshi Chino worked before joining Binance — left the country in January. Coinbase is also reportedly considering an exit due to the high cost of maintaining a licensed exchange amid low demand in the country.
Those requirements exert an outsized strain on Japan’s smaller exchanges, many of which are no longer commercially viable. 
“Definitely, there’s an oversaturation in the number of retail crypto exchanges compared to the demand,” said Justin Dhingra, chief strategy officer at Tokyo-based Web3 services platform Crypto Garage. “The question is: who are the active ones? I would say only around three are really making money. Last year, everyone was losing money. The rest are either for sale or they’re dormant.” 
A call to Tokyo-based Coinhub Inc., a one-token (BTC) exchange first registered in 2017, suggested this is in fact the case. Despite still featuring on the FSA’s updated list of registered cryptocurrency exchanges, a nonplussed-sounding voice on the other end of the line said the company is no longer in business. It is now just a phone number, they said, despite the declaration on the company’s website that its services represent “the future of digital finance!”
The problem, Dhingra said, is that the future of digital finance in Japan appears less about cryptocurrency trading, where “the types of people are finance guys, the engineers, techies and product managers,” and more about exploring and building out the creative possibilities of Web3. 
Japan, he said, is likely to experience success in developing a native digital economy by leveraging its existing strengths and intellectual property in video games, anime, manga. Which is why the bigger, more successful, even profitable Japanese exchanges have diversified to include services like Coincheck’s NFT marketplace — designed to make the most of those strengths rather than relying on one-note crypto trading services. 
Whether or not that goal is a good thing for smaller exchanges is a matter of debate. 
“Their [Binance’s] expansion to Japan is definitely positive for Web3 in Japan given that Binance is one of the top players across the globe, even though some of the local exchanges have strong opinions on this,” said Sota Watanabe, a government-affiliated Web3 spokesperson and the founder of the Astar Foundation blockchain development platform. Those opinions derive from a concern about the future, Watanabe said. 
Many domestic exchanges have also spent large sums of money on compliance in accordance with local regulations, he continued, whereas “Binance didn’t do this so far. In that sense, I can understand what existing exchanges are saying.” Still, Watanabe added, “I hope Binance changes the status quo and makes the environment better for users, not for exchanges.”
For former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, the amount of money required to maintain a licensed exchange means it is now difficult for anyone other than the biggest crypto companies to operate in Japan. “This is a strategy that results in a very closed market, very little competition and very little innovation,” he said. 
But it may not be all doom and gloom for the licensed smaller exchanges — particularly those with the capacity to adapt as they wait out the ongoing crypto bear market.
Blockchain evangelist and a member of the Tokyo-based Blockchain Collaborative Consortium, Tatsuo Oku, said Binance’s official entry into Japan was “inevitable.” He said he now hopes the arrival of the world’s largest exchange will spark an influx of foreign interest in the nation’s Web3 industry in line with other jurisdictions like Dubai and Singapore, revitalizing the domestic market.
“Exchanges will maintain their registration in Japan and wait for these opportunities,” Oku said. They will just have to be “patient and wait for the right time to get the market going,” he added.

Dogecoin Next Move: Will $0.055 Launch A Recovery Phase?;"Dogecoin (DOGE) has found itself in a precarious position, with its price being squeezed into a narrow range, hinting at a potential decisive breakout in the near future. 
Market analysts closely monitor the crypto’s struggle to breach a longstanding resistance trendline, as an upside breakout could trigger a fresh rally, while a continuation of the current stalemate may lead to a further decline.
Earlier this week, DOGE encountered its fifth rejection from a persistent resistance trendline that has thwarted its upward momentum. The rejection left its mark on the daily candlestick chart, characterized by a prominent high wick, indicative of aggressive overhead supply. 
Historical data reveals that such patterns often precede significant corrections in the cryptocurrency market.
The current price of DOGE, according to CoinGecko, stands at $0.058295, with a 24-hour dip of 1.5% and a minor seven-day loss of 0.1%. 

In the event that the prevailing selling pressure continues, there is a high probability that the value of the coin will see a further decline of approximately 4-5%. This decline may potentially lead to a reevaluation of the annual support trendline, with a projected value of approximately $0.055.
Presently, the price of this memecoin is situated inside the confines of two prominent trendlines, indicating an impending occurrence of either a definitive upward surge or a downward decline.
Despite the gloomy price outlook, there is a glimmer of hope for DOGE enthusiasts. The report also predicts that if the coin manages to sustain a breakout above the resistance trendline, investors could witness a sharp 16.8% surge, targeting the $0.068 level. This possibility is poised to keep traders and investors on the edge of their seats.
On the other hand, data from IntoTheBlock reveals some intriguing insights into DOGE’s current state. It’s been found that a significant portion of DOGE addresses, specifically 61%, are currently at a loss.

A deeper dive into the data exposes the fact that only 31% of the total DOGE holders are in profit, highlighting the challenging landscape for DOGE investors. An additional 10% of holders remain in a neutral position, while a substantial 59% of Dogecoin holders find themselves in a losing position.
One silver lining in this scenario is the fact that 72% of DOGE holders have maintained their positions for over a year, signifying a strong commitment to the digital asset. A further 26% of holders have held DOGE for a duration ranging from one month to 12 months, while 2% of holders have relatively shorter-term positions, spanning less than a month.

As the Dogecoin community eagerly awaits the impending breakout or breakdown, the cryptocurrency market remains a dynamic and uncertain space, where opportunities and risks are constantly shifting.

Dogecoin (DOGE) has found itself in a precarious position, with its price being squeezed into a narrow range, hinting at a potential decisive breakout in the near future. 
Market analysts closely monitor the crypto’s struggle to breach a longstanding resistance trendline, as an upside breakout could trigger a fresh rally, while a continuation of the current stalemate may lead to a further decline.
Earlier this week, DOGE encountered its fifth rejection from a persistent resistance trendline that has thwarted its upward momentum. The rejection left its mark on the daily candlestick chart, characterized by a prominent high wick, indicative of aggressive overhead supply. 
Historical data reveals that such patterns often precede significant corrections in the cryptocurrency market.
The current price of DOGE, according to CoinGecko, stands at $0.058295, with a 24-hour dip of 1.5% and a minor seven-day loss of 0.1%. 

In the event that the prevailing selling pressure continues, there is a high probability that the value of the coin will see a further decline of approximately 4-5%. This decline may potentially lead to a reevaluation of the annual support trendline, with a projected value of approximately $0.055.
Presently, the price of this memecoin is situated inside the confines of two prominent trendlines, indicating an impending occurrence of either a definitive upward surge or a downward decline.
Despite the gloomy price outlook, there is a glimmer of hope for DOGE enthusiasts. The report also predicts that if the coin manages to sustain a breakout above the resistance trendline, investors could witness a sharp 16.8% surge, targeting the $0.068 level. This possibility is poised to keep traders and investors on the edge of their seats.
On the other hand, data from IntoTheBlock reveals some intriguing insights into DOGE’s current state. It’s been found that a significant portion of DOGE addresses, specifically 61%, are currently at a loss.

A deeper dive into the data exposes the fact that only 31% of the total DOGE holders are in profit, highlighting the challenging landscape for DOGE investors. An additional 10% of holders remain in a neutral position, while a substantial 59% of Dogecoin holders find themselves in a losing position.
One silver lining in this scenario is the fact that 72% of DOGE holders have maintained their positions for over a year, signifying a strong commitment to the digital asset.

XRP Whale Takes Advantage Of Price Dip To Accumulate 410 Million Tokens;"As the price of XRP has dipped over the last few days, bearish sentiment once again took hold of the community. However, not everyone seems to have succumbed to this negative sentiment as one whale has chosen this as a perfect time to buy a large number of tokens.
At a time when morale is falling due to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) debunking rumors that it had approved the BlackRock iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF, one XRP whale has made an enormous token purchase.
The transaction which was reported by whale tracker Whale Alert showed that this single whale had bought more than 409 million XRP tokens. The whale had withdrawn the tokens from the Bitvavo Exchange to a private whale which is assumed to be for safekeeping. At the time of the transaction, the tokens were worth almost $202 million, showing a very high level of conviction in this whale.
         409,776,402 #XRP (201,627,816 USD) transferred from #Bitvavo to unknown new wallethttps://t.co/j0ho6BYxce
— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 17, 2023

This whale transaction is a welcome change from last week when XRP whales seemed intent on dumping their holdings as fast as possible. As Bitcoinist reported, whales had moved more than $20 million worth of tokens to centralized exchanges.
The purpose of these transactions was suspected to be for selling and this was selected by the token’s price falling not too long after, clearing the support at $0.48. However, there seems to be a turn in the tide and as accumulation ramps up, the digital asset is beginning to show strength on the charts.

As the XRP price has begun to see recovery, there is a slow but steady change in the attitude of investors toward the digital asset. As data from the CFGI website shows, the XRP Fear & Greed Index has moved back into the neural territory after falling into fear previously.
Interestingly, this recovery in sentiment mirrors that of the broader crypto market. According to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, sentiment is now sitting at a perfect neutral, giving both bears and bulls a perfect environment to pull crypto prices in their favor.

This means that there is just as much chance for a recovery in the XRP price as there is for a decline. In the end, the price will swing toward the camp which creates more pressure. So if buying pressure continues to mount, then a price recovery above $0.5 could be imminent. However, if sell pressure becomes higher, then it is possible to see the digital asset tumble back down toward $0.46.

The dark side of crypto: A story of fraud and political transformation in Florida;"Brian Beute is currently running for political office under Andrew Yang’s pro-tech political party. His history on crypto might have affected his decision as well as the ballot in the smallest elections. His decision to join the political world comes from the crypto fraud activities that have pushed many in Florida to losses. 
The region of Florida isn’t typically associated with major political innovations. The unexpected turn of events displayed a rise for its first Forward Party candidate, all fostered by a crypto fraud scandal. 
As such, the turn of events shows the relationship between activism, politics, and digital technology. In the long run, this means a new chapter for the state of Florida’s political landscape. 
Brian Beute was a new face in the political office back in 2019, a time when his knowledge of crypto was limited. However, he hadn’t encountered scandals and corruption in the political world before this. Moreover, under normal circumstances, the race of county tax collectors is barely involved with presidential advisory or copious criminal activities involved in illicit Bitcoin mining. 
Initially, Beute’s occupation was as a music teacher in a local school. His future opponent, on the other hand, who was fluent in Republican interaction, used public funding to create a crypto mine on government property and was part of a minor’s sex work trafficking after flying to Miami. 
Beute, being a conservative from Michigan, his move to Florida was an eye-opener as he witnessed the manipulation of the legacy finance system. This was done for political profit and land development. 
Still, the consequences of Beute declaring a run for political office, despite the controversies he has faced since his political declaration, are yet to reflect on his life today. 
Beute vowed this month to assist in cleaning up corruption crimes as an election supervisor and became the first candidate for the Florida Forward Party. It’s a centrist organization that was founded by Andrew Yang, a former presidential candidate, and a pro-crypto enthusiast. 
Brian’s story on his political rise shows the story of how the first candidate for the third party entailed the repercussions of disruptive technology. His tale explains the effects on existing systems, showcasing the growing discontent among moderators and how it could change America’s political trajectory. 
Brian Beute challenged the convicted crypto fraudster Joel Greenberg in his first campaign in 2019, during the Republican primary elections for tax collectors in Seminole County, Florida. His major focus was motivated by running rumors of Joel’s illegal cryptocurrency mining and abuse of power that also embroiled the US House Representative, Matt Gaetz in a scandal. 
Joel Greenburg started his crypto journey back in 2017 when he borrowed money from family members to balance the public funds he had commingled with his own. He had requested additional public funds for a crypto purchase and over $90,000 in ming equipment. All these funds were lost in a fire.
Joel also launched a corporate crypto entity tagged “Government Blockchain Systems LLC” that had the tax collector’s office as its only client. He later employed a convicted real-estate scammer, Keith Ingersoll, to aid him in acquiring the office property. 
The scam artist Keith had previously been involved in fraudulent activities, gathering over $15 million initial coin offering (ICO) scheme through the Organic Fresh Coin. The ICO never distributed any digital assets. 
Greenburg, being Beute’s opponent, launched a retaliatory campaign that targeted his opponent and designed to smear his reputation. Greenburg employed a team that sent letters and emails to the school and falsely debunked Beute, stating his involvement in sexual misconduct as a music teacher.
This orchestrated attack affected Beute’s political run as investigations about his alleged misconduct were ongoing. He even lost to J.R. Kroll, who replaced the convicted crypto fraudster Joel Greenberg. 
Greenberg pleaded guilty to 6 counts related to criminal activities, among them making false accusations against Brian Beute. He was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2022. 
Last month, the Forward Party announced a 12-state battleground map that included Florida. According to Beute, commenting on his decision on response to polling, he stated:
The Forward Party is an incubator for independents and moderates who genuinely care about discussing, designing and delivering consensus solutions outside of the current political structure.
Andrew Yang had declared the Forward Party as a crypto party and even released an NFT that assisted in launching the Forward Party. The party acknowledged the alignment of crypto proceedings with its goals. 
The Joel Greenberg crypto fraud greatly affected the state of Florida, and as such, the Florida Forward Party’s first candidate, Brian Beute, was motivated to get involved in politics.

Bitcoin Halving Countdown Begins: Here’s What To Expect From The 2024 BTC Halving!;"The post Bitcoin Halving Countdown Begins: Here’s What To Expect From The 2024 BTC Halving! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The crypto market continues gaining stability as Bitcoin price constantly gains momentum. BTC price has displayed massive fluctuations since Monday as the star crypto has added over 5.5% in its value within a week and has started gaining momentum.
At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price was trading at $28,676.58. The BTC coin is approximately 180 days away from the next halving. Investors eagerly await the prolonged bull run to ignite as the upcoming halving is predicted to set a new ATH for the BTC price, with the price crossing the $100,000 mark for the first time. Post-halving, the size will reduce to 6.25 per block.
The Bitcoin price is said to be currently trading in an accumulation phase. It is expected to gain significant traction by next year after halving, following which the coin is calculated to go as high as around $140K.
If the BTC coin manages to achieve the predicted price, this will result in a growth of a massive 388% increase in its value, with a difference growth of over $111,343 within the next two years.
The market is expected to record increased price volatility in the coming time as the halving date approaches. Further, due to the pending Bitcoin spot ETF approval by the SEC, the price may experience a correction in the short-term perspective, but a breakout is imminent. 
CrytpoCon, a well-known Bitcoin technical analyst with a substantial following of 55.9K+ on the “X” platform, has been testing the cycle top experiments lately for the Bitcoin price, of which the result was said to be the same. The analyst claims that the BTC coin is expected to reach a top of over $130K by the end of December 2025 as its new ATH.
I've been doing a lot of #Bitcoin cycle top experiments lately, and I keep seeing right around the same price… 130k.Here again, we see a price of 138k.These trends start at the bottom from the first early top (yellow dot)The trend is then drawn across diagonal support… pic.twitter.com/Flv61XYhE0
The price is expected to record its top at +/- 21 days from Nov 28th, 2025, according to the analyst’s halving cycles Theory, most likely in December, according to his BitTime model quotes the analyst. Further, he feels that the price is bound to mark its price above $130K as all possibilities show a similar outcome.
The BTC price was seen trading close to its important support level of $26,848.44 on 15th October, after which the price experienced a pump-and-dump as it quickly jumped to $29,990.67 and then plunged to $28,058.70 due to a hoax news in the market.
The price is currently hovering close to its support level of $28,466.41. If the bulls gain power, the price will continue to rise and test its resistance level of $28,800 soon.
Further, if the BTC continues to gain momentum, the price will make a run and test its upper resistance of $29,600 in the coming days.
On the contrary, if the bears come into power and pull the price below its support level, the star crypto will lose momentum and continue to fall and test its lower support level of $28,129.37 this week.

Grayscale To Sidestep SEC? Expert Ponders Bold Bitcoin ETF Move;"In a recent X (formerly Twitter) exchange, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store and host of the ETF Prime podcast, and Scott Johnsson, finance lawyer at Davis Polk, dissected the potential for Grayscale to make a daring move regarding the uplisting of its spot Bitcoin ETF to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Their conversation revolved around the possible advantages, risks, and implications of such a decision.
Geraci initiated the discussion by suggesting a daring strategy: “Interesting hypothetical play for Grayscale… Just go ahead & uplist GBTC to NYSE now. Make SEC force delisting & ask for forgiveness later (or just point to court victory). Obviously we need NYSE & market makers/APs to go along (probably the trickiest part), but what’s the risk at this point?”
Johnsson responded with skepticism about NYSE’s willingness to support Grayscale’s bold Bitcoin ETF move, pointing out the need for an effective registration statement for the ETF, which Grayscale currently lacks: “I had a similar thought and struggle to imagine NYSE Arca going along with this. Still need an effective registration statement as well for the ETF, which they don’t have.”
In defense of his stance, Geraci highlighted the SEC’s exceeded time frame, implying the ETF has been “deemed approved.” He questioned the risks involved and emphasized the possible rewards for the NYSE: “NYSE shows they go to bat for ETF issuers…They obviously want listings/volume. Volume they’d clearly get with the first mover GBTC ETF. Goodwill with prospective ETF issuers = priceless. Listings would increase IMO.”
Johnsson conceded to some of Geraci’s points but remained skeptical, stating: “I’ll buy that. Think SEC still has enough arrows in the quiver to tilt the calculus against such a move regardless of things like disclosure review.”
In a subsequent comment, Geraci emphasized the broader benefits the New York Stock Exchange could potentially reap by supporting Grayscale in this audacious move. He stated, “NYSE would gain a ton of credibility/new biz w/ ETF issuers tho IMO… Just don’t see SEC really questioning NYSE’s credibility at this point.”
By making this strategic move, the NYSE could fortify its position and reputation in the industry. Geraci believes that, ultimately, the decision would boil down to a cost/benefit analysis, adding, “I’m just saying that analysis has become much more compelling than some might be thinking.”
In a separate thread on X, Johnsson delved deep into the ongoing saga between the SEC and Grayscale regarding the conversion of the GBTC into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Citing a recent interview with SEC chair Gensler, Johnsson speculated that Gensler is keeping a low profile on GBTC, as there is likely a battle going on behind the scenes over whether Grayscale will have to resubmit its application after the ruling.
He highlighted that the SEC issued a disapproval order on June 29, 2022, just a week before their final deadline. Yet, in a turn of events, the DC Circuit ruled the disapproval order unlawful on August 28, 2023. Johnsson outlined the complicated implications of this ruling: “So the tricky question is how does this order to vacate by the DC Circuit actually impact GBTC? Did the SEC satisfy the statute to issue a disapproval order even if it was later ruled unlawful and vacated?”
According to Johnsson, the key issue lies in statutory interpretation. Grayscale’s lawyers are presenting an argument that, if the SEC’s order is deemed void, then GBTC’s conversion is “deemed approved,” eliminating the need for any further action from Grayscale.
However, Johnsson stressed that while this “deemed approved” argument holds some weight, it is not a guaranteed victory. He stated, “Now while I think the ‘deemed approved’ argument is colorable, it’s certainly not a slam dunk.”
He suspects Grayscale is leveraging this position in its negotiations with the SEC, saying, “To be clear, I do not expect this argument to come into play other than as a point of leverage. It would likely require litigation to resolve that would take longer than simply refiling.”
At press time, Bitcoin traded at $28,319.

In a recent X (formerly Twitter) exchange, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store and host of the ETF Prime podcast, and Scott Johnsson, finance lawyer at Davis Polk, dissected the potential for Grayscale to make a daring move regarding the uplisting of its spot Bitcoin ETF to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Their conversation revolved around the possible advantages, risks, and implications of such a decision.
Geraci initiated the discussion by suggesting a daring strategy: “Interesting hypothetical play for Grayscale… Just go ahead & uplist GBTC to NYSE now. Make SEC force delisting & ask for forgiveness later (or just point to court victory). Obviously we need NYSE & market makers/APs to go along (probably the trickiest part), but what’s the risk at this point?”
Johnsson responded with skepticism about NYSE’s willingness to support Grayscale’s bold Bitcoin ETF move, pointing out the need for an effective registration statement for the ETF, which Grayscale currently lacks: “I had a similar thought and struggle to imagine NYSE Arca going along with this. Still need an effective registration statement as well for the ETF, which they don’t have.”
In defense of his stance, Geraci highlighted the SEC’s exceeded time frame, implying the ETF has been “deemed approved.” He questioned the risks involved and emphasized the possible rewards for the NYSE: “NYSE shows they go to bat for ETF issuers…They obviously want listings/volume.

Coinbase’s liquidity boost: 80 trading pairs removed to strengthen market resilience;"Coinbase, the renowned United States-based cryptocurrency exchange, has made a strategic move to boost liquidity on its platform by suspending 80 non-USD trading pairs. This significant decision, announced is in alignment with Coinbase’s commitment to enhancing overall market health and consolidating liquidity.
Coinbase’s decision to suspend 80 non-USD trading pairs underscores the exchange’s dedication to maintaining a robust and efficient marketplace. Among the affected trading pairs are those involving prominent cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), stablecoins like Tether (USDT), and fiat currencies such as the euro. These pairs were removed from Coinbase, Advanced Trade, and Coinbase Prime platforms at precisely 19:30 UTC on October 16, 2023.
Coinbase justified this move by emphasizing its intention to improve liquidity and enhance market health. Users, however, need not be concerned, as they can still engage in trading these assets through Coinbase’s more liquid USD order books using their USD Coin (USDC) balances.
The exchange sought to clarify that the suspended trading pairs represented only a negligible portion of Coinbase Exchange’s total trading volume, indicating that the impact on most users would be minimal.
This action from Coinbase is part of a series of measures aimed at optimizing liquidity on its platforms. In mid-September 2023, Coinbase removed 41 non-USD trading pairs for similar reasons, with a focus on bolstering liquidity. Importantly, while numerous USDT-containing trading pairs were suspended, none of the affected markets included USDC, a stablecoin that Coinbase co-developed in collaboration with Circle.
Coinbase’s persistent efforts to improve liquidity are set against a backdrop of declining trading volumes in 2023. According to data from cryptocurrency market data provider CCData, Coinbase’s spot trading volumes for the third quarter experienced a notable 52% decline compared to the previous year. This decline in trading activity reflects a broader trend in the cryptocurrency industry, with other major exchanges also facing similar challenges.
Binance, one of the industry giants, has also encountered challenges in maintaining market share dominance in 2023. CCData’s data shows that Binance’s spot market share has witnessed a steady decline over seven consecutive months. From holding a commanding 55% share of the market in early 2023, Binance’s market share dwindled to 34% by September 2023.
The declining market share of both Coinbase and Binance suggests that factors beyond liquidity are at play in the crypto industry. Regulatory changes, market sentiment, and the maturation of the industry are some of the broader dynamics influencing these shifts.

Whales Holding at Least $1,572,000,000 in Ethereum Now Own Nearly 33% of Total ETH Supply, Says Santiment;"Blockchain analytics platform Santiment says that crypto whales are accumulating massive amounts of Ethereum (ETH).
Santiment says that addresses holding at least one million ETH have accumulated more than 32% of the total supply, the most since 2016.
The firm also says big ETH transactions are heating up.
“Ethereum’s whale addresses in the billionaire tier (holding at least one million ETH) now hold 32.3% of the available supply for the first time since 2016. Yesterday’s transactions valued at $1 million-plus also had its second-highest day in five weeks. History is being made.”
ETH is trading for $1,572 at time of writing.
Santiment also noticed that stablecoin activity picked up Monday after a news site falsely claimed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a spot market Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF).
“Tether’s largest wallets had big accumulation spikes during yesterday’s crypto fireworks. The top 10 largest wallets are back to holding a quarter of the entire USDT supply, and the top stablecoin’s on-chain transaction volume hit a two-month high.”
Lastly, Santiment said that altcoins used for tipping users on Reddit plummeted in value after the social media platform announced it was ending the three-year-old blockchain-based Community Points program.
“Reddit’s community is expressing disdain toward its CEO [Steve Huffman, known as “u/spez” on Reddit] and the choice to sunset community points [and] toward MOON, BRICK, DONUT, and others commonly earned through insight contributions and peer tipping. Moon plummeted as much as -89.9% in bout three hours.”

Spot Bitcoin ETF Could Trigger a 155% BTC Explosion, According to CryptoQuant- Here’s the Timeline;"On-chain data provider CryptoQuant says that the approval of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could boost the price of BTC by triple-digit percentage points.
In a new report, CryptoQuant says that billions of dollars would flow into the BTC market and consequently more than double Bitcoin’s price if the Wall Street firms that have applied to issue a spot Bitcoin ETF allocate a fraction of their assets under management (AUM) to the flagship digital asset.
Some of the financial giants seeking to issue a spot Bitcoin ETF include BlackRock, VanEck and Fidelity Investments.
“We could expect $155 Billion will flow into the Bitcoin market once these ETFs are approved. The total Assets Under Management of these companies are around $15.6 trillion. If they were to put 1% of their AUM into these Bitcoin ETFs, the total US dollar amount that would enter the Bitcoin market could be approximately $155 Billion…
The increase in the Bitcoin Market Capitalization we calculated above implies the market cap would increase between 82% and 165% from the current level and that Bitcoin price could reach between $50,000 and $73,000 as a result of these inflows of fresh money.”
Bitcoin is trading at $28,550 at time of writing and a jump to $73,000 would represent a 155% gain.
On when spot Bitcoin ETFs could be approved by the SEC, CryptoQuant says,
“Although these ETFs are not expected to be approved this year, the probability that they will be approved by the final deadline (March 2024) has been growing as a result of favorable court rulings for Grayscale (GBTC Fund) and XRP in the respective legal fight against the SEC.”

Pennsylvania reverses crypto mining permit ban amid union pressure;"Pennsylvania’s proposed cryptocurrency mining ban has been removed from a bill aimed at regulating the industry’s energy consumption. The move came after intense pressure from trade labor unions and concerns about the impact on Democratic Party support. Instead of the ban, the bill now imposes ongoing reporting requirements on crypto miners operating in the state.
Pennsylvania’s House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee narrowly passed the Cryptocurrency Energy Conservation Act, ending months of legislative inaction, with 13 votes in favor and 12 against. The bill had been sitting in the committee since its introduction on June 21.
Democratic Representative Greg Vitali, the chair of the committee and the bill’s sponsor, cited pressure from trade labor unions and Democratic Party leaders as the reason for removing the proposed two-year crypto mining ban. According to Vitali, the building trade labor unions had a consistent history of opposing environmental policies. He claimed that these unions held significant influence over his Democratic colleagues.

“Frankly, [the unions have] the ear of House Democrats, and they can peel off members who would otherwise be supportive of good environmental policy,”
Vitali stated, underscoring the sway these groups held within the Democratic majority in Pennsylvania’s House.
Vitali emphasized that pushing against the unions’ interests could risk the Democratic majority in the state’s House, making it preferable to pass the bill without the mining ban rather than not pass it at all. He noted that his earlier experiences as majority chair taught him that strong environmental policies had limited support.
The proposed two-year ban would have halted the issuance of new and renewed permits for crypto mining facilities in Pennsylvania. However, following the removal of the ban, the bill has been revised to include an impact study on mining operations and new reporting requirements.
Under the revised bill, crypto miners in the state must submit various pieces of information within six months. This information includes the number and size of mining sites operated, details about energy sources, emissions reports, and data on energy and water consumption. Pennsylvania-based crypto miners will be required to submit these reports annually. Additionally, new miners entering the state must provide the same information before commencing operations. 
The decision to abandon the two-year crypto-mining ban has significant implications for Pennsylvania’s emerging crypto-mining industry. Stronghold Digital Mining, a crypto mining company, recently established operations in the state, which is the third-largest coal-producing state in the United States. The company had acquired two coal-burning power plants with the intent to use plant waste to power hundreds of Bitcoin mining rigs.
In July, Stronghold Digital Mining had sought approval to burn shredded tires to produce up to 15% of its energy needs, a move that faced strong opposition from local environmental groups.

Uniswap’s New Fee Structure: Are You About To Pay More For These Tokens?;"Recently, Uniswap, a prominent decentralized exchange, made headlines by introducing a 0.15% swap fee on specific tokens. While generating buzz and curiosity, this decision has raised several questions regarding its impact on traders.
Decentralized exchanges (DEX) facilitate peer-to-peer trading without intermediaries. The absence of centralized entities has advantages but also presents challenges, especially regarding fee structures. 
Uniswap’s latest update to alter its fee structure is a significant shift with potential implications for its large user base.
According to data shared by Colin Wu, a blockchain-focused reporter, the daily fees from this change on Uniswap V3 could range between $388,000 and $444,000. 
Providing deeper insight into the platform’s operations, Wu mentions that approximately 35% to 40% of the entire transaction volume on Uniswap occurs on the front end.
These figures, while substantial, are just the tip of the iceberg. Specific tokens targeted for this new fee include popular tokens such as ETH, USDC, WETH, USDT, DAI, WBTC, agEUR, GUSD, LUSD, EUROC, and XSGD. 
However, according to the Chinese reporter, this fee will only apply when these tokens are traded through Uniswap Labs interfaces on the mainnet and its supported Layer 2 networks.
Currently, about 35%-40% of the transaction volume in Uniswap is completed through front end, H/T @1kbeetlejuice. Ethereum Uniswap V3 in the past 24h is $810m, excluding major stablecoin pairs, which is $740m, the daily fees charged by V3 may be $388k-444k.… https://t.co/EAeV6xwQHX
— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 17, 2023
While the announcement sparked curiosity, it also led to some confusion concerning the fees. Uniswap’s help center, in response, clarified that these newly implemented fees stand apart from the Uniswap Protocol fee switch, which is determined through votes by Uniswap’s governance mechanism.
Despite the explanation by the DEX’s team, the genesis of this new fee introduction remains ambiguous to many within the community. 
In response to Wu’s initial post, several individuals opposed the update, with a particular user questioning the rationale behind the 0.15% fee, the considerations leading to this specific percentage, and the selection of particular tokens for the fee imposition.
According to data from Coinmarketcap, Uniswap has reported a significant trading volume of $518.3 million in the past 24 hours, capturing 18.3% of the market share within the decentralized exchange sector.
Meanwhile, Uniswap native token UNI has witnessed a substantial decline. The asset has dipped by more than 10% over the past two weeks and showed a continuous drop of 5.5% in the last 24 hours. Currently, UNI is trading for $3.8.

Currently, about 35%-40% of the transaction volume in Uniswap is completed through front end, H/T @1kbeetlejuice. Ethereum Uniswap V3 in the past 24h is $810m, excluding major stablecoin pairs, which is $740m, the daily fees charged by V3 may be $388k-444k.… https://t.co/EAeV6xwQHX
— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 17, 2023
While the announcement sparked curiosity, it also led to some confusion concerning the fees. Uniswap’s help center, in response, clarified that these newly implemented fees stand apart from the Uniswap Protocol fee switch, which is determined through votes by Uniswap’s governance mechanism.
Despite the explanation by the DEX’s team, the genesis of this new fee introduction remains ambiguous to many within the community. 
In response to Wu’s initial post, several individuals opposed the update, with a particular user questioning the rationale behind the 0.15% fee, the considerations leading to this specific percentage, and the selection of particular tokens for the fee imposition.
According to data from Coinmarketcap, Uniswap has reported a significant trading volume of $518.3 million in the past 24 hours, capturing 18.3% of the market share within the decentralized exchange sector.
Meanwhile, Uniswap native token UNI has witnessed a substantial decline. The asset has dipped by more than 10% over the past two weeks and showed a continuous drop of 5.5% in the last 24 hours. Currently, UNI is trading for $3.8.

Bitcoin Attains New Spot Regime as Long-Term Holders Persist in Accumulation: Bitfinex;"Analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex have noticed a significant shift toward spot trading for Bitcoin, resulting from long-term BTC holders persisting in their accumulation strategy amid unfavorable market conditions.
According to the latest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha report, long-term holders now have 80.34% of the total bitcoin supply, accounting for 15 million BTC. In comparison, assets with short-term holders have fallen to 19.34%. Analysts said this indicated a strong commitment to holding assets.
With long-term holders carrying on with their accumulation strategy, the realized profits and losses for bitcoin have been negligible. Bitfinex found that the realized profit and loss per BTC has plunged to its lowest since 2019.
The current realized profit stands at $724 while the loss is $236, compared to April 2021 and May 2022, when the average profit and loss figures were $12,900 and $6,700, respectively. Per historical data, the decline in realized profit and loss indicates that the market is in a transitional phase, as bitcoin has shown pronounced volatility when the figures slump to current levels.
“Given these current levels, which are markedly lower than the last cycle’s profit and loss figures, the majority of coin transactions are occurring around their original cost basis. This paints a picture of a market where the dominant players are either seasoned holders who are indifferent to price changes or traders scrambling for a slightly advantageous position,” Bitfinex said.
Furthermore, Bitfinex analysts noted that the gap in supply across long-term and short-term holders is significant because, according to BTC’s history, the behavior usually occurs at the onset of a bull market or the transitory phase where the market ranges for some time in an illiquid environment after a pullback.
As the crypto market remains illiquid, analysts believe that spot transactions will play a pivotal role in determining the movement in the upcoming weeks and months.
Meanwhile, BTC and Ether have witnessed a surge in open interest in futures markets, with the former’s aggregate across centralized crypto exchanges surpassing $8.7 billion, suggesting impending volatility and mass liquidations for both short and long positions.

Bitcoin Spot ETF On The Horizon: Galaxy Digital CEO Forecasts Imminent Approval In 2023;"Amid recent fake news that rattled the crypto community, the anticipation and excitement surrounding the potential approval of Bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have not waned. 
Adding to the growing optimism, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has provided further hope for the imminent approval of these funds.
During a recent interview with CNBC, Novogratz, the CEO of the crypto asset management company, expressed his belief that the Bitcoin spot ETF will receive regulatory approval from the SEC in 2023. 
He cited the constructive discussions between Bitcoin ETF issuers and the SEC as an indicator of the likelihood of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval shortly. Novogratz emphasized: 
We think a Bitcoin ETF will be approved this year in 2023. All indications of dealing seem to be heading in the right direction. There’s a tremendous amount of pressure to do something that is rational. The American public wants this.
One crucial factor that Novogratz highlighted as a game-changer for the SEC is the recent court ruling for Grayscale. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission decided not to appeal the court’s decision in a case involving the federal securities regulator and Grayscale Investments. 
According to Novogratz, this development has significantly impacted the regulatory landscape and paved the way for potential approval.
Novogratz further revealed that the ongoing dialogue between Galaxy Digital, its partner Invesco for the spot BTC ETF, and the SEC has been encouraging, pointing towards an imminent approval. 
These discussions have provided positive signs that the regulatory authorities are open to embracing the spot Bitcoin ETF framework.
Regarding the earlier fake reports about spot BTC ETFs, Novogratz emphasized that any positive announcement in this regard will likely positively impact the market. 
Many believe that the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has significant implications for the Bitcoin market and the broader crypto space.
This week’s events have underscored the tremendous potential and influence that approval could have, not only in the Bitcoin market but also in shaping the future of the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. 
As the dialogue between Bitcoin ETF issuers and the SEC continues to evolve, the crypto community eagerly awaits the SEC’s decision, hoping it will pave the way for increased accessibility and mainstream adoption of Bitcoin investments.
The leading cryptocurrency in the market, BTC, is being traded at $28,100, representing a 0.9% decline within the past 24 hours.

Anthony Scaramucci Says Bitcoin To ‘Easily’ Hit $15-Trillion Market Cap As BTC Touches $28,000;"
In a jaw-dropping turn of events, Bitcoin soared back above the $28,000 mark on Monday as investors price in the SEC’s potential approval of several pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications. The electrifying rally has sparked bullish calls for the pioneer cryptocurrency to meet or even exceed a $15-trillion market capitalization.
SkyBridge Capital founder and managing partner Anthony Scaramucci is ultra-bullish on Bitcoin. The former U.S. politician now believes Bitcoin has the potential to grow by a whopping 2,662% from its current market capitalization of approximately $546 billion, per CoinGecko data.
“I think Bitcoin could easily be a $15 trillion asset,” Scaramucci said in a recent interview that he expects Bitcoin to “easily be a $15 trillion asset” in the coming years amid the broken U.S. financial system. According to the business magnate, Bitcoin is “more valuable than gold” and could become a store of value. Scaramucci noted that because of those reasons, “we own a lot of Bitcoin here.” 
Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a 4.8% gain in the past 24 hours, pushing its price above $28,138 at publication time. The rapid ascent came after an important legal update in Grayscale’s Bitcoin spot ETF aspirations. As ZyCrypto reported previously, the Securities and Exchange Commission did not file an appeal against an August court ruling related to its blocking Grayscale’s ETF application.
Many have predicted a steep rise in #Bitcoin Here are some catalysts as to why:ETF, halving, fed easing, increasing appetite for hard assets as US deficit takes center stage w investors, inclusion in model portfolios.    The ETF is huge because it essentially eliminates…
Scaramucci’s $15 trillion prediction of the Bitcoin market cap signifies a price of over $700,000 per coin, considering its hard cap of 21 million.
Ethereum (ETH), the second most valuable cryptocurrency, saw a 4.0% increase, recapturing support above $1,618.
The rest of the cryptocurrency market took cues from the upsurge in Bitcoin and Ethereum, with across-the-board rallies.
The overall crypto market cap surged 4.0% since yesterday, adding around $25 billion. The most bullish move came from Solana as the FTX bankruptcy estate staked roughly 10% of its massive holdings over the weekend, easing worries of a potential dump. SOL rose by 7.8%, making it the best performer among the market’s top ten cryptocurrencies.
BNB, the native token of the global Binance exchange, has also enjoyed a rally today after the company eliminated a colossal sum of 2.14 million BNB tokens — valued at $453 million — from circulation in its 25th quarterly burn event.

Bitcoin And The Arab Spring: Lessons For Revolutionaries Communicating;"Bitcoin is not simply a new monetary tool, a new currency, or an additional asset class. I tell people that Bitcoin is a Monetary Revolution. The Bitcoin eco-system is full of innovations to bring value beyond simply price growth to new all-time-highs. You can say that the value proposition is built on the foundations of the ever-expanding benefits of the wonder-currency. 
After my failed attempt to first invest in Bitcoin in early 2010, I found myself traveling and working in the Middle East, and Egypt in particular, later that year. Inadvertently, the events of the Arab Spring in the region showed me how today the Social Layer of Bitcoin can be a powerful tool supporting Bitcoin adoption.
The year 2010 was the culmination of several visits I made to the region over the previous years that allowed me to amass a large group of friends and colleagues in Egypt. Egypt is a massively impressive country that hosts a grand capital. Cairo is the world’s first truly international metropolis. In some way its ancient wonders mask the multinational and multicultural mix of the city. It is a financial hub, the people are wondrous, friendly, and open to ideas. It is the globe’s first melting pot, having been established as such thousands of years before New York city coined the phrase. I found the most delicious sushi restaurants in Cairo, the best mango and the freshest fish served on the banks of the Nile River brought in from the Alexandria seaside. 
Unfortunately, underlying the ancient wonders there existed issues of poverty, political unease, and the impact from regional tensions. I was told that around 1/3rd of the population of Cairo’s approximately 20 million people had trouble feeding themselves daily. Bribes to public servants, while prevalent, were not really the wicked administrative corruption found in the Western world but occurred as a survival mechanism to enable people to simply earn enough money for their daily necessities. The brewing pot of concerns in Egypt and the region ignited the Arab Spring in late 2010 and early 2011. 
When we speak about Bitcoin adoption, we talk about expanding the understanding and knowledge of people. The Bitcoin eco-system is filled with start-ups offering both free and paid services to help the broader public become knowledgeable and comfortable enough to adopt it. Not only is understanding important, the ability for current users to interact and communicate among themselves with clarity and no noise is also vital. 
Just as with Bitcoin adoption and the need for a supporting communication framework through the Social Layer, the role of Social Media was equally important in contributing to the events of the Arab Spring. Wikipedia stated that “In the wake of the Arab Spring protests, a considerable amount of attention focused on the role of social media and digital technologies in allowing citizens within areas affected by ‘the Arab Uprisings’ as a means for collective activism to circumvent state-operated media channels.”
In 2010 Facebook was the go-to platform for attempting to communicate semi-noise-free on various topics and connect with like-minded cohorts. It was the organizing tool anchoring a broader Social Layer supported by the likes of WhatsApp and Tango, with the latter being the main used chat app across the Middle East at that time and the mechanism, along with direct old-style phone calls, that I used to keep in touch with my Egyptian friends and colleagues. 
Noise and the Social Layer
We all know about and have experienced email spam, fake accounts on various social media portals, and comments from influencers that are masked self-promotions. In the Bitcoin world, we often attribute such noise to the crypto-sphere with the all-to-often “free coin giveaway” promotions. 
Noise, or white noise as was written about in the novel titled “White Noise” by Don DeLillo in 1985 that won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction, has haunted Bitcoiners for over a decade. This noise equally impaired efforts during the Arab Spring in allowing clear communication between people. It continues to impair Bitcoiners like myself today, if perhaps under less ominous circumstances. 
A social experience or movement can only become an effective Social Layer when noise is lessened. Reducing or removing noise enables development of a usable and supportive Social Layer for Bitcoin.
During the days of the Arab Spring, reports by mainstream media in the region were highly questioned. The region did not trust the various cable-based news services. This reinforced the role of a Social Layer as the mechanism to communicate and share views, thoughts, and plans. For me, I tried often in vain to keep updated about the events and the safety of my friends. However, news sources were unclear, often conflicting, and biased. I took all this with a grain-of-salt and had to go directly to the sources on the ground, meaning chats with my friends via Tango, following Facebook groups and via old-style phone calls. 
Like the noise I experience today when trying to understand and sort through information that is valuable and factual regarding Bitcoin, I experienced the same noise dilemma during the Arab Spring events. 
Today I am frustrated when I read a report or see a Tweet commenting on the price of Bitcoin based on some influencer’s supposed “expertise”, only to then find over the next few weeks that Bitcoin rallies to a near-term high. I recall one specific Tweet, just as when Bitcoin hit its recent cycle low, saying that “we should all expect it to hit $10,000.” I am not a trader of Bitcoin but get upset when this type of noise is spread. I also get irritated when I am contacted by someone implying that they are a Bitcoiner only to find out that they just want to connect within the realm of the dating-world and don’t even know how to spell hodl. Back during the Arab Spring, I was equally frustrated when phone calls to colleagues dropped unexpectedly, messages via Tango were cryptic and the Facebook accounts of friends were blocked. With frustration the questions I sent were often unanswered: “Was that you on TV at the march?” “Is your area of Cairo blocked off?”
While today I can say that noise in the Bitcoin world is more of an unreasonable annoyance, to my friends in Egypt noise was a matter of personal well-being or even life-and-death. Social Media then was the means for mobilization and action, a Social Layer. Today the Social Layer of Bitcoin is the mechanism for pursuing further adoption. We are all certainly irritated today when some social media giants block or restrict accounts that discuss Bitcoin. However, can you imagine what it felt like to my Egyptian friends back in 2011 when they could not access their perceived noise-free gateways to understand what their future would hold? 
I have experienced that “Noise” is the adversary of freedom. It impaired my Egyptian friends from effectively supporting their desired national transformation. It also impairs my support for Bitcoin and its Monetary Revolution. A strong Social Layer provides feeling, context and motivation. Just as I felt the angst of my friends day-to-day as they experienced the uncertainties of the Arab Spring, I feel disappointment when I seek to find rigorous and valuable connections in the Bitcoin space that only result in wasted time and false relations. From my first investment in Bitcoin I have supported the development of its echo-system and simultaneously support the role-out of a deep Social Layer so that there can be Less Noise but More Signal.
What I have learned from my experience is that the Social Layer of Bitcoin is creating a Social Revolution for the asset. We need to disrupt old modes of communication to assure and protect the ability for real human interaction among Bitcoiners that is not impaired by noise. I don’t want to have my life’s Bitcoin connections held ransom to the whims of whom I meet only randomly. I am taking the seeds of what I learned from the time during the Arab Spring and planting them today in Bitcoin’s Social Layer. Stronger relationships will help to build a stronger Bitcoin.

With frustration the questions I sent were often unanswered: “Was that you on TV at the march?” “Is your area of Cairo blocked off?”
While today I can say that noise in the Bitcoin world is more of an unreasonable annoyance, to my friends in Egypt noise was a matter of personal well-being or even life-and-death. Social Media then was the means for mobilization and action, a Social Layer. Today the Social Layer of Bitcoin is the mechanism for pursuing further adoption. We are all certainly irritated today when some social media giants block or restrict accounts that discuss Bitcoin. However, can you imagine what it felt like to my Egyptian friends back in 2011 when they could not access their perceived noise-free gateways to understand what their future would hold? 
I have experienced that “Noise” is the adversary of freedom. It impaired my Egyptian friends from effectively supporting their desired national transformation. It also impairs my support for Bitcoin and its Monetary Revolution. A strong Social Layer provides feeling, context and motivation. Just as I felt the angst of my friends day-to-day as they experienced the uncertainties of the Arab Spring, I feel disappointment when I seek to find rigorous and valuable connections in the Bitcoin space that only result in wasted time and false relations. From my first investment in Bitcoin I have supported the development of its echo-system and simultaneously support the role-out of a deep Social Layer so that there can be Less Noise but More Signal.
What I have learned from my experience is that the Social Layer of Bitcoin is creating a Social Revolution for the asset. We need to disrupt old modes of communication to assure and protect the ability for real human interaction among Bitcoiners that is not impaired by noise. I don’t want to have my life’s Bitcoin connections held ransom to the whims of whom I meet only randomly. I am taking the seeds of what I learned from the time during the Arab Spring and planting them today in Bitcoin’s Social Layer. Stronger relationships will help to build a stronger Bitcoin.

Forbes predicts BlackRock and JPMorgan will drive the next bull run;"BlackRock and JPMorgan, one of the leading companies in America, are at the forefront of crypto as well. Since its inception, the crypto market has been on a rollercoaster ride, with Bitcoin having the lead charge and being a poster child for the digital revolution. 
Bitcoin’s notary has grown over the years, igniting development proceedings in the financial sector. Termed as digital gold, the crypto has acted as a hedge against uncertainties of the economy. 
According to Forbes, two financial giants, JPMorgan and BlackRock, could fuel the next Bitcoin bull run. The report confirms the same for Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP). Following the buzz on BlackRock – one fuelled by fake news- shows that the crypto market is set to witness a huge surge in the coming months. 
According to Forbes, JPMorgan and Blackrock are quietly assembling the groundwork for an upcoming Bitcoin price surge that could also affect other crypto coins. Based on the report, Bitcoin’s recent surges have boosted other major coins, ETH and XRP included. 
This was after a recent false report that spiked Bitcoin’s market value to the $30,000 mark before correction to its current level, ranging between $28,300 and $28,500. 
The report also states that the crypto space will face “a huge BlackRock-led earthquake this month.” This was following the mistaken report this week on the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving the BlackRock spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF). 
Moreover, the recent fake reports have brought more attention to developments concerning BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF approval. The long-awaited ETF approval has been anticipated, and positive sentiments on the matter loom over the future of crypto. 
As the firms use blockchain technology and tokenization, they are set to attract significant institutional demand, leading to their investment in the crypto space. This will, in turn, increase the capitalization of certain assets as well as their liquidity. Among them are Bitcoin and XRP.  
Forbes also pointed out that  BlackRock has become the first Wall Street titan to employ JPMorgan’s blockchain-based collateral segment. This coincides with part of BlackRock’s plans as a chief executive of the firm, Larry Fink, commented, stating it  “will usher in the next generation for markets.” Fink news crypto as an elevation of traditional currencies.
Reports have it that Fink has been a top advocate for cryptocurrencies. Since last year, his vocal sentiments on digital currencies call out the technology as an “essential” tool in the financial market. He has commented on crypto, claiming “very interesting developments are happening in the digital asset space.”
Following XRP’s struggle to hit the $0.5 mark, Forbes has confirmed a potential Bitcoin bull rally that could be massive for the crypto community. This has also been supported by reports that the XRP wallets with 100k to 100M have increased since last year from $7.16 to $7.89. 
Additionally, Senior Forbes Contributor Billy Bambrough hints at a potential upward swing driven by these firms, and this sets the stage for an impressive appreciation of cryptocurrencies in the market. 
Forbes’s report highlights a collaborative effort between JPMorgan and BlackRock in the digital space. BlackRock’s historic milestone aligns with the vision of providing a pivotal role in the crypto market. The tangible manifestation of this integration on tokenization of shares is among its money market funds. 
BlackRock has leveraged JPMorgan’s Ethereum-based Onyx blockchain. This enables an over-the-counter derivatives trade. This has the potential to revolutionize the traditional handling of financial assets as they become more accessible at a friendly cost. 
Bitcoin provided the possibility of digital asset open-ledger tokenization that involves ownership conversion and implementation of rights into crypto tokens. As such, they can be effortlessly traded as well as recorded in the blockchain ledgers. The advantages it offers include accessibility, efficiency, and security.

Inaugural Bitcoin Ordinals Trading Fund Attracts Institutional Interest as It Goes Live;"Institutional investors are taking a bold step into the world of Ordinals as the sector’s first managed fund goes live, promising to actively trade and invest in Ordinals-related assets. Led by portfolio manager L. Asher Corson from Consolidated Trading, the Unbroken Chain fund has already secured significant partnerships and is poised to raise $5 million from limited partners.
The world’s first Ordinals trading fund will specialize in trading and investing in various Ordinal types, encompassing BRC-20 tokens, unique sats, and inscriptions. This move marks a pivotal moment for Ordinals as they transition from niche ventures to a recognized asset class. General partners of the fund include the creator of the BRC-20 token standard, Domo; BTC Inc.’s UTXO Management; and Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor’s former communications director, Isabel Foxen Duke. 
Domo, the innovator behind the BRC-20 token standard, expressed enthusiasm for the growing institutional interest in Ordinals. ""It’s very exciting to see institutional interest in Ordinals as an independent asset class rather than an exclusive venture capital play.""
Unbroken Chain has already made waves in the Ordinals market with its initial investments. Notably, the fund was the buyer of the Bitcoin Rock sold for 3 BTC on September 21, 2023. This marked a significant milestone as it was the first Bitcoin Rock purchase since March 7th, drawing widespread attention from the Ordinals community.
Rocktoshi, founder of Bitcoin Rocks, shared an inscribed image of the fund's announcement, declaring, ""the institutions are coming.""
UTXO Management investor and BTC Inc. CEO David Bailey expressed his excitement, stating, ""We’re thrilled to be leading the charge of institutional investment directly into Ordinals assets.""
The Unbroken Chain fund's plans to raise $5 million from limited partners demonstrate the confidence that investors have in the potential of Ordinals. With initial contributions already reaching $1.5 million, it is evident that there is strong demand for exposure to this emerging asset class.

BlackRock Says Bitcoin Market Is Unregulated, Lacks Transparency In New ETF Filing;"Investment management giant BlackRock filed an amended version of its spot Bitcoin ETF S-1 application form on Wednesday, following numerous updated filings from rival firms.
The updated filing includes five additional pages of text warning of additional risks the fund’s investors may face, including risks related to Bitcoin itself.
In the filing dated October 18, BlackRock modified a risk disclosure related to how its share prices can be impacted by chaotic events in the crypto industry at large. While previously addressing how fraud and security failures around major Bitcoin exchanges could affect the fund, BlackRock expanded its warning to include Bitcoin itself, whose market is “unregulated” and “lacks transparency.”
“Due to the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of digital asset exchanges… as well as the wider bitcoin market, the value of bitcoin and, consequently, the value of the Shares may be adversely affected, causing losses to Shareholders,” wrote BlackRock.
The filing cited data from 2019 claiming that 80.95% of spot Bitcoin volume was “false or noneconomic in nature” – particularly that volume being traded outside of U.S. regulated venues. More recent analysis from Bitwise, a rival ETF applicant, suggests that fake volume as a share of total BTC volume is far less than it was four years ago, though it is still significant.
Regarding such rivals, however, BlackRock’s amendments acknowledge the fierce competition the company faces from other applicants, which may absorb market share from BlackRock’s own product. “There can be no assurance that the Trust will achieve initial market acceptance and scale due to competition.”
According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, eleven different companies besides BlackRock are racing to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF as of October 17.
The new applications also explain how BlackRock will calculate Bitcoin’s price, using an aggregate from several spot Bitcoin exchanges to form its benchmark.
In an interview on Monday, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood noted a change in behavior from the SEC concerning its tone toward ETF issuers, given its willingness to ask constructive questions regarding their applications.
“The fact that the SEC chose to ask questions is a change in behavior,” said Wood. “Therefore, I do think hopes are rising that a – or a number of – Bitcoin ETFs will be approved.”
Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz is equally bullish, predicting on Wednesday that a spot Bitcoin ETF will likely be greenlighted within the next three months.
After Bitcoin pulled above $28,000 earlier this week, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink called the asset’s rally a “flight to quality.”

Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF resubmission challenges SEC’s caution;"Fidelity Investments has resubmitted its application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the “Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust,” their anticipated Bitcoin spot ETF. This revised proposal comes as a response to the regulator’s earlier concerns.
The essence of the Bitcoin ETF is straightforward. Investors can buy and sell fund shares that reflect Bitcoin’s price, eliminating the need to handle or secure the cryptocurrency directly. Hence, this becomes a more accessible avenue, especially for institutional investors, to navigate the unpredictable waters of the crypto market.
Moreover, Fidelity’s resubmission underlines its trust in digital assets’ enduring growth and significance. It also highlights the firm’s intent to address its clients’ increasing appetite for varied and avant-garde investment solutions.
Abigail Johnson, Fidelity Investments CEO, is no stranger to the importance of blending traditional finance with cryptocurrencies. She’s been a vocal supporter, aiming to simplify access to digital assets like Bitcoin for investors.
However, the SEC’s stance on Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has been one of caution. Concerns about market manipulation, potential fraud, custody issues, and the overarching need to protect investors have been at the forefront. Consequently, proposals from firms like VanEck and Valkyrie have yet to see the light of day, facing rejection or prolonged delays.
Yet, Fidelity’s proposal might tilt the scales. With its established reputation and significant resources, the firm’s updated ETF proposal pledges improved transparency, liquidity, and security. These elements could address the SEC’s apprehensions.
Significantly, the crypto community is on tenterhooks, awaiting the decision on Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF. An approval could open the doors for institutional investors, potentially boosting demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a rejection might dampen investor spirits, influencing market sentiment and value.
Additionally, the market is still rebounding from the recent misinformation about BlackRock’s iShares Spot BTC ETF approval on 16th October. This led to a substantial disruption, wiping out over $1 billion in total open interest.

‘Ripple Is The Internet Of Value’ Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Says In Recovered Video;"The competition between Ripple and Ethereum has been a long-running one given the capabilities of both networks. This was further exacerbated by the fact that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chose to bring a lawsuit against Ripple over XRP being allegedly a security but the same was not done about Ethereum’s ETH token.
Both communities have since been at loggerheads with each one trying to prove that they’re better than the other. As a result of this, a video from 2014 has been dug up where Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin seems to be praising Ripple.
In the video that was posted by X (formerly Twitter) user @NerdNationUnbox, Buterin seems to be very convinced about the value proposition of Ripple. The setting which suggests a talk at an event featured a young Vitalik Buterin talking about what Ethereum is really about.
The 14-second video seems to be focused on the ‘internet of value’ which the Ethereum founder explained that people often think Ethereum is about. However, as he explained, Ethereum is not the internet of value. Rather, the founder said that Ripple is actually the internet of value.
Internet of value is actually a concept that was presented by Ripple which looked to build an Internet that makes it easy for people to transfer any asset of value seamlessly between themselves. It consists of any asset that could be valuable including information, internet currencies, stocks, etc, to be transferred instantly to someone.
Steven Nerayoff who has become widely known in crypto circles as the ‘Ethereum Whistleblower’ is back once again and going for Vitalik Buterin. In an October 13 post, Nerayoff tagged Buterin, whom he describes with #CryptoJudas, saying that he actually wanted to be XRP.
Nerayoff attached a screenshot of a deleted tweet from the Ethereum founder talking about XRP as sound money. “But he’s so shy he deleted his tweet which is in this article stating that XRP is ‘better sound money than Bitcoin’,” Nerayoff wrote.

However, as other X users have pointed out, Buterin seemed to actually be making fun of XRP in the tweet. Responding to another user who presented Bitcoin as sound money, Buterin said “The chart for XRP/XRP would look the same”, but his use of ‘TM’ with the terms Institutional adoption and Partnerships suggests he was not being serious as this has been an established way to joke about something on the internet.
Nevertheless, the post is still very open to interpretation and there have been responses from both sides. One Ripple community member stated:
This is the same guy who a few months earlier was rejoicing when XRP was attacked by the SEC, he also was angry that Chris Larsen had suggested the Chinese had too much influence in BTC and ETH.  XRP really hit a nerve not because we were wrong, but because we could see through his scammy games.

Attention Traders: Bear’s Captivate $29,000 Levels, BTC Price May Withness Another Massive Plunge;"The post Attention Traders: Bear’s Captivate $29,000 Levels, BTC Price May Withness Another Massive Plunge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
After trading within a prolonged period of uncertainty, the Bitcoin price appears to be materializing the term ‘Uptober’. Despite the interim losses, the price continues to flash bullish signals that indicate a larger possibility of reaching the short-term milestone of $30,000 in the next few days. As a result, the bears have found a nice opportunity to cash out their profits, which may certainly not be a good sign for the BTC price rally.
The token made a massive rise in the past few trading days, reaching above the crucial levels at $29,000. Although it faced a minor pullback from these levels, it continues to display huge bullish momentum. Ever since the start of the year, the traders have been extracting small profits at minor spikes, and a similar action is expected to occur very soon. A popular analyst, Ali, shared data, according to which investors are going against the trend.

According to the above data, traders have begun to short BTC heavily, expecting the price to continue to plunge. As the Bitcoin price approached $29,000, nearly 51% of all the accounts on the Binance exchange with an open BTC futures position went short. This indicates that the traders believe the price may undergo another rejection, as it did a couple of days before.
However, this can also be considered a huge bullish signal, as the price could rebound finely and trigger a fine rise as soon as the short positions are closed. This could propel the Bitcoin price not only above $29,000 but also closer to $30,000. The BTC price, after rising above the crucial resistance at $28,446 failed to strengthen its presence above $29,000. Despite a significant pullback, it continues to trade around the same levels, indicating strength among the bulls.
Therefore, larger possibilities of a continued ascending trend may be expected that may assist the Bitcoin price to regain the lost levels above $29,000.

Bitcoin Diamond Hands Now Hold 76.2% Of Supply, A New Record;"On-chain data shows that Bitcoin long-term holders now own 76.2% of the entire supply, a new all-time high for the cryptocurrency.
In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards talked about the trend in the supply of BTC long-term holders. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to the investors who have been holding onto their coins since at least 155 days ago.
Generally, the longer a holder keeps their coins dormant, the less likely they become to move these coins at any point. Because of this reason, the LTH group includes the investors with the strongest resolve.
Historically, the LTHs have kept quiet regardless of what’s going on in the wider market, as they don’t easily get enticed by profit-taking opportunities and ignore FUD situations. This resilience has earned this cohort the popular name “diamond hands.”
The simplest way to track the behavior of the LTHs is through the combined supply that they are holding in their wallets right now.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that these HODLers own currently:

As displayed in the above graph, the supply held by the Bitcoin long-term holders has seen an uptrend in the past year or so, suggesting that HODLing has become more dominant among investors.
Something to keep in mind is that the LTH supply going up doesn’t mean that these HODLers are buying right now. Rather, what it reflects is that some accumulation happened 155 days ago; the coins have only matured enough to be part of the cohort today.
After the latest rise that the indicator has registered recently, it has reached the 76.2% mark, and in the process, has broken the all-time high (ATH) set back in 2015.
The current value implies that the Bitcoin short-term holders (STHs), the hands who are weaker in resolve and make regular trades, control less than a quarter of the supply. “Less liquid supply means the same people are bidding on less coins,” notes Edwards. “You do the math.”
An interesting fact is that since the supply of the cryptocurrency is always heading up as miners produce new coins by mining blocks, the supply today is notably higher than back in 2015 when the LTH supply hit its previous ATH.
This naturally means that the pure amount of capital that’s locked in the holdings of these diamond hands is now also much more at a similar percentage of the supply held.
With such an unprecedented dominance of the LTHs in the market, it now remains to be seen how the cryptocurrency’s price will develop in the long term.
Bitcoin’s rally has hit a pause in the past few days as the cryptocurrency hasn’t been able to gain any significant momentum above $28,400.

Ripple CTO Questions SEC’s Stance on Ethereum (ETH) Security Classification;"The post Ripple CTO Questions SEC’s Stance on Ethereum (ETH) Security Classification appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
After Slamming Charles Hoskinson over his defense of the SEC’s views on Ethereum (ETH) over other projects, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has raised an eye-opening question to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning the security classification of Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. 
Schwartz’s query transpired from the recent fake news of the SEC-approved BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This news created a ripple effect in the market, leading to an instant surge in the prices of significant digital assets, including Bitcoin, which saw a spike of over 10% and halted at $29K. However, this initial rally was short-lived as it was revealed that the news was based on misinformation. This correction prompted a rapid retraction of crypto prices back to their previous levels. 
Awesome. Does the SEC think people selling ETH on exchanges are selling securities? I'd like to hear from the best source. https://t.co/Mvgaa9DgUH
In response to this, the SEC issued a stark warning urging the public to exercise caution when consuming information from the internet, emphasizing that the most reliable source of information about the SEC is the SEC itself.
David Schwartz took this opportunity to pose a pertinent question to the regulatory agency. He inquired whether the act of crypto traders selling ETH on digital exchanges could be interpreted as a transaction involving securities. Schwartz expressed his desire to receive an official response from the SEC, emphasizing the Commission as the ultimate authority. As of the time of writing, the SEC has not yet addressed Schwartz’s inquiry.
This question from Schwartz carries significant weight due to the ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple. In this lawsuit, the SEC alleges that Ripple’s systematic sales of XRP on digital exchanges constitute an investment contract falling under the category of securities. Although a federal court ruled in favor of XRP, determining that secondary market sales did not infringe securities laws, the SEC maintains its stance, asserting that the decision raises pivotal legal questions.
David Schwartz’s inquiry regarding the security status of ETH comes in light of the belief within the crypto community that the SEC has been particularly favorable towards Ethereum. Despite current SEC Chairman Gary Gensler reiterating that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency unequivocally outside the SEC’s regulatory scope, suspicions persist regarding the SEC’s stance on Ethereum, fueling the ongoing discussion within the crypto community. 
While Bitcoin approvals will open the market for Bitcoin, it will also clear the XRP path for future rallies. If $16 billion flows into the ETF market, history suggests a potential 4% Bitcoin price surge, taking it beyond $37,500, says analyst Crypto Researcher.

When Will Bitcoin Price Reach $1,000,000? Pundit Lays Out A Timeline;"Since the Bitcoin Price crossed $50,000 back in the 2021 bull market, there have been speculations on when the price will hit $100,000, and on the other extreme end, $1,000,000. Over time, various analysts and pundits have put forward their forecasts, but the most recent of these is from budding economist Alessandro Ottaviani who believes BTC could hit the $1 million mark in the next three years.
Ottaviani starts out his X (formerly Twitter) post by pointing out that the Bitcoin market cap had climbed rapidly following fake news of a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Now, recall that on Monday, media outlet Cointelegraph made a post on X saying that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved the BlackRock iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF filing.
Following this, the price of Bitcoin surged above $30,000 and in a matter of minutes, over $50 billion was added to the crypto’s market cap, as Ottaviani points out. Going by BTC’s reaction to this news which eventually turned out to be fake, the analyst was able to draw a parallel for what might happen when Spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved for real.
Main take away of today: Bitcoin makrket Cap went up by more than $50 billion in minutes, and very likely the money flowing into Bitcoin were less than $500 million (ratio 100:1)
A former Blackrock Director said that we can expect $150-200 billion flowing into Bitcoin in 3…
— Alessandro Ottaviani (@AlexOttaBTC) October 16, 2023
Ottaviani points out that this $50 billion increase in market cap came from an around $500 million injection into the market, meaning the market cap rose at a ratio of 100:1. Thus, going by what BlackRock Director and CEO Larry Fink said about a Spot ETF triggering a $150 billion to $200 billion inflow into the asset, Ottaviani explains that this would put BTC’s market cap at $21 trillion. At a $21 trillion market cap, the price of each BTC would be going for $1 million.
Now, about when this might happen, Ottaviani reverts to Fink’s statement. When Fink made his forecast that $150-$200 billion could flow into Bitcoin, he said that this could happen over a three-year period. So if a Spot Bitcoin ETF is approved in 2024 as Bloomberg analysts believe, then the price of Bitcoin could reach this $1 million mark in 2027-2028 if all goes as planned.
“Surely on the way up there will be many people selling, but this is already directionally clear how much could be the effect of the BTC ETFs being approved,” Ottaviani said in the X post.

Ottaviani is only the most recent in a long line of market participants and crypto enthusiasts who have predicted that the price of Bitcoin would reach $1 million. Some notable personalities who believe it will reach this level include ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, and finance author Robert Kiyosaki.
Cathie Wood who has been a very vocal proponent of Bitcoin said last year that she expects the price of BTC to hit $1 million by 2030. Due to this belief, Wood’s investment firm ARK Invest has been heavily investing across the crypto space, buying hundreds of thousands of shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, as well as Coinbase stock.
Next on the list is Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan who made a bet in June 2023 that the BTC price would reach $1 million. Srinivasan pointed to “hyperbitcoinization” as the reason behind this. However, Srinivasan’s forecast was on a much shorter timeframe (90 days) and didn’t play out as predicted.
Last but not least is finance author Robert Kiyosaki. Kiyosaki has been sounding the alarm of a potential collapse of the US dollar and has presented the likes of Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin as good alternatives to hedge against this potential collapse. In August, Kiyosaki said in an interview that if the economy were to collapse, Bitcoin could reach $1 million, while Gold and Silver could rise to $75,000 and $60,000, respectively.

SBF dined with Eric Adams at the NYC Mayor’s go-to Italian restaurant;"Sam Bankman-Fried, commonly known as SBF, has been on the radar amidst the lawsuit against him. According to the FBI trial testimony, SBF was scheduled to meet up with the New York City governor, Kathy Hochul. Additionally, reports prove that SBF had links with the NYC Mayor, Eric Adams. 
Reports have it that the Mayor and the former FTX CEO had a meeting at a famous Italian eatery. 
SBF is a well-known crypto titan and is the founder of FTX, the former leading crypto exchange that has been an instrument in realizing the disclosure of digital currencies. Before the collapse of the exchange firm, Sam Bankman-Fried was in conversations with top political officials. The nature of their meetings is still unknown. 
In the months preceding the FTX collapse, Sam Bankman-Fried was in talks with top financial power brokers before his arrest. At one point, Sam had a soiree with the NYC Mayor at his treasured late-night haunt. This information was gathered by the FBI and was presented as a testimony in his latest hearing. The FBI agent was a specialist in phone record analysis. 
Both SBF and the NYC Mayor dined at the Osteria La Biba Italian restaurant in March 2022. According to the mayor’s public schedule, the meeting titled “Hold for Mayor” was at 8:30 p.m., set for March 3. The details of who he was meeting were undisclosed. 
Moreover, Mayor Adams is a well-known supporter of digital currencies and is termed a huge crypto enthusiast. This can be proved by his first mayoral paycheck that was denominated into Ether and Bitcoin.
He even had talks of turning New York City into a crypto hub. Adams had previously expressed these crypto development interests that also aligned with SBF’s vision for the digital world. The meeting could have been part of the financial manipulations or just a friendly dinner between friends. However, this is yet to be proved in detail. 
In another report, Sam had also planned to meet up with NYC Governor Kathy Hochul at The Capital Grille Steakhouse, which was ironic since SBF is a vegan. This happened in September 2022. 
Based on the emails prosecutors selected, Bankman-Fried was in demand before the fall of the FTX firm. In another incident, SBF has also been asked by the Bahamian Prime Minister to give his son advice on a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) project. 
The crypto wunderkind was a prominent personality in the investment world. This was evidenced by a group of 32 senior financial representatives requesting access to SBF at a group dinner. Among them included Morgan Stanley and George Soros.
The FBI agent who was on record, Special Agent Richard Busick, explained to the jury using a series of meetups and testified, highlighting how SBF’s alleged criminal activities played out in Gotham City. 
Agent Busick also testified and revealed that the crypto guru often visited the Big Apple in 2022 before the fall of his company, despite living in the Bahamas.
Once, SBF showed up for a 15-minute photoshoot with Forbes in midtown. Another time, he was spotted with Saudi Arabia’s finance minister, Khalid A. Al-Falih, and also the head of the sovereign wealth fund, Yasir Al-Rumayyan. All these meetings were scheduled and streamed by the former CEO’s personal assistant, Natalie Tien. She assisted in managing SBF’s business activities. 
Sam Bankman-Fried’s activities impacted NYC’s financial landscape despite not residing in the city. The meetings held together with political officials sparked interest in whether there was a political collaboration with the crypto billionaire or intended manipulation activities in the city’s financial circle.

US Government Holds Over $5,500,000,000 in Bitcoin (BTC), According to On-Chain Data;"On-chain data indicates that the US government is currently one of the largest Bitcoin (BTC) whales in the world.
According to researchers at 21.co, the US government possesses 194,188 BTC worth more than $5.5 billion at time of writing.
21.co is the parent company of 21shares, the world’s largest crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) issuer.
That trove represents nearly 1% of BTC’s total circulating supply.
The 21.co researchers also note their analysis is a “lower-bound estimation of the US government holdings based on publicly available information.” Their dashboard tracks wallets associated with the government’s three largest BTC seizures since 2020.
The US government has reportedly confiscated at least 215,000 BTC since 2020, though some of that was moved earlier this year.
Blockchain security company PeckShield notes that the government sent 9,826 BTC worth $217 million to top domestic crypto exchange Coinbase in March.
The government also reportedly transferred an additional 39,175 BTC worth $867 million to two new addresses that appear to be internally controlled and not linked to any exchanges.
BTC is trading at $28,384 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 71% since the start of 2023 but remains nearly 59% down from its all-time high of more than $69,000, which it hit in November 2021.

Bitcoin’s Next Move: Is $30,000 Just Around The Corner? Glassnode Founder Predicts;"As Bitcoin teases the psychological barrier of $30,000, enthusiasts and analysts appear to be closely watching every price movement. The general sentiment so far seems to be not a question of ‘if’ but ‘when’ BTC will make its way past this significant mark.
Glassnode founder, aptly named “Negentropic”, recently shed some light on Bitcoin’s current price action via a post on X (formerly known as Twitter). The analyst observed that the top cryptocurrency remains comfortably perched above the 100-hourly SMA, consistently maintaining its price above the $28,000 range.
Diving deeper into the specifics, Negentropic pinpointed an immediate resistance for Bitcoin at $28,550. This is the threshold that the analyst believes could act as a catalyst for further price movements. 
According to Negentropic, if Bitcoin breaches this resistance and pushes past the $29,500 mark, it’s almost certain that the top crypto will set its sights on the coveted $30,000 level. Going by the momentum, it’s not unrealistic to even anticipate a peak of around $30,650, the analyst concluded.
Are bulls taking control as they rally around the $28k zone?
Main takeaways:
• Current price > $28k & above the 100 hourly SMA 
• Immediate resistance at $28.55k 
• Break past $29.5k could lead to $30k target 
• Potential to reach beyond $30.65k with continued momentum… pic.twitter.com/Al8q2xGg5V

However, price isn’t the only metric painting a bullish picture for Bitcoin. In another post on X that sparked considerable interest, on-chain analytics firm Santiment disclosed that the number of Bitcoin wallets holding a minimum of 100 BTC has surged significantly, reaching 15,970.
 #Bitcoin‘s number of wallets holding at least 100 $BTC has jumped to 15,970 after the largest single day jump of 2023 on Saturday. Since this accumulation, $BTC‘s price is +5.3%, and they may not be done. We will continue to monitor. https://t.co/l0drhvkf7E pic.twitter.com/0mDAmys7N4

His statistic often signifies increased confidence among larger investors, suggesting that the ecosystem’s key players are anticipating a continued upward trajectory for BTC.
Recently, Bitcoin’s price has exhibited a bullish trend. Over the past week, the asset has surged by 7.5%. This uptick has propelled BTC to trade above the $28,500 threshold, currently priced at $28,698, marking a 1.2% increase in the last 24 hours.
From the analysis provided by Negentropic, BTC seems to have decisively breached its resistance at $28,550. This break could signify an imminent upward rally, based on insights from the Glassnode founder.
Another expert, Ali Martinez, recently pointed out the significance of the $25,000 and $30,000 price ranges in BTC’s trajectory. According to Martinez, these are “crucial demand bucket(s) in BTC history,” marking the entry points of institutional giants like MicroStrategy and Tesla into the Bitcoin arena.
Most people, especially institutional investors like @saylor @MicroStrategy & @elonmusk @Tesla, bought #Bitcoin between $25K & $30K, making this a crucial demand bucket in $BTC history.
So when they tell you “It’s too late to buy #BTC” or “Wait for $20K,” please ignore them! pic.twitter.com/B6rGtYidY6

Mainstream media still trying to smear crypto with terrorist financing claims;"A recent Wall Street Journal report, among others, claim that terrorist organisations such as Hamaz and Hezbollah are arranging their funding through the use of cryptocurrency. 
That mainstream media can still be attempting to blacken crypto by continuing to state that it is being used for money laundering and terrorist financing, is becoming rather puerile.
Of course, there is bound to be some use of crypto, but compared with the dollar, this is likely to be a drop of water in the barrel by comparison. The Wall Street Journal article claims that $41 million in crypto was used by Hamaz, while $91 million was used to fund Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
This is like claiming that a drug dealer bought his latest shipment of drugs with U.S. dollars, and therefore the dollar is a dirty currency and should be sanctioned.
Mainstream media appears to still be using the strategy of if you throw enough mud at crypto and continue to do so, surely some of it will stick and the name of crypto will perhaps be tarnished in the eyes of ordinary people, thereby giving the government more power to levy even heavier regulations and restrictions.
The real reason behind the constant barrage of negativity with crypto is that governments fear private money. If the people start protesting against the persistent debasement of their currency by buying and holding crypto such as bitcoin, the entire rotting carcass of the banking system will cave in on itself and collapse.
What happened in Canada last year with the truckers should be a warning to the lengths that a government will go to in order to stop citizens from legally donating their money to a cause. Entering people’s homes and demanding they supply their private keys to crypto wallets is an extreme.
Chris Skinner, author and commentator on digital finance, wrote a thought-provoking article earlier today on the subject of crypto funding for terrorists. He stated:
“The thing is that these reports smear the use of decentralised or alternative currencies all with the same brush. Crypto bad, internet bad, government good, banks good. It is a crude delineation that does not recognise that most terrorist funding actually takes place through the traditional banking system, using nested accounts and money laundering that, even with all of the efforts of governments of the world, is rife.”
Skinner is of the view that terrorist funding is a problem across all financial assets, and that crypto forms a very small part of this. Political influence being used to try and blame this issue on crypto could be considered a fraudulent undertaking in itself.

Bitcoin Price Nears $30,000 Amid Ongoing Spot Bitcoin ETF Talks with US SEC;"The post Bitcoin Price Nears $30,000 Amid Ongoing Spot Bitcoin ETF Talks with US SEC appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Bitcoin flirted with $29,000 in a resounding move, heralding fresh hope in the crypto-sphere. What fueled this surge? The impetus behind this surge stems from ongoing discussions between spot Bitcoin ETF applicants and the US SEC. The agenda? Crucial alterations—ranging from custodial intricacies to environmental mindfulness in mining.
Break down on pivotal amendments, covering custodial protocols, adherence to GAAP standards, risk disclosures, and the environmental impact of mining operations. 
Bitcoin’s relentless ascent currently sees it not just breach $29,000 but edge tantalizingly close to the $30,000 milestone. Despite a notable pullback from the critical $28,446 resistance, it holds its ground around these levels, signaling robust bullish sentiment. 
This persistence may help reclaim the $29,000 threshold that was briefly lost. Bitcoin’s price has risen 2% in 24 hours and 6% weekly, surpassing $30,000. This surge is propelled by heightened institutional interest and positive market sentiment.
The market anxiously awaits Bitcoin’s next move. While other crypto assets battle SEC rules, a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval will boost Bitcoin bullishness before December. Let’s see how crypto reacts to the SEC’s ETF talk show.
According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst, James Seyffart, the recent developments signal a positive shift towards the SEC’s potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. While more revisions are anticipated, the ongoing dialogue underscores growing confidence in the possibility of ETF approval. Analysts have significantly raised the odds of this approval, particularly following updates made by major players like Ark Invest and 21Shares to their spot Bitcoin ETF prospectuses. Plus, he anticipates SEC spot Bitcoin ETF approval by January 10.
More proof that potential spot #Bitcoin ETF issuers are in communication with SEC regarding changes/amendments required for SEC to consider approving. Positive signs IMO https://t.co/2LYU5aTlyJ
“This back-and-forth between the SEC and fund sponsors is standard practice for new launches but a first for spot Bitcoin ETF applications, indicating that the SEC is working to approve Ark’s proposal.” An analyst quoted previously. 
Now Fidelity has filed an amended application. Three issuers down, six-ish to go.. https://t.co/47Aw37MDTa
To increase the chances of approval, Fidelity Investments aligns its spot Bitcoin ETF filing with the latest SEC recommendations, indicating a concerted effort to navigate regulatory waters. This development mirrors a broader trend, with other key players in the Bitcoin ETF sphere also in the process of refining their applications. 
SEC’s no-appeal show on the Grayscale case is pumping the heart of Spot ETF enthusiasts as they see this as a sign that the SEC may approve all pending ETF applications. In this regard, Grayscale believes converting GBTC to an ETF would align prices with actual bitcoin value. This shift allows for the creation or removal of ETF shares based on demand, potentially eliminating any discount.

September Sees Web3 Industry Growth with 2,607 Blockchain Games;"Footprint Analytics provided significant insights on market attitudes and advancements in September in the ever-changing world of blockchain gaming. Bitcoin’s price range was $25,158 to $27,210, reflecting market stability.
The Web3 gaming industry is growing. September saw 2,607 games, up 2.6% from August and 15.0% from April. The expansion indicates a healthy ecology and rising creator and player involvement. However, the Web3 gaming industry faces various obstacles. Player acquisition, retention, and longevity remain issues.
Polygon was the leading blockchain platform with 39 games and 1,000+ active users. This represents 8.6% of the site’s games. The BNB Chain grew 5.3% and Ethereum 1.5%. The findings show that blockchain gaming is varied, with many platforms gaining popularity.
In September, 13 projects had token prices rise 20% or more. Nakamoto.Games was particularly popular due to an 80.4% price increase. This shows the potential for Web3 gaming developments.
Web3 gaming received eight significant investment rounds in September. ProofOfPlay, a notable firm, raised $33 million in the month’s largest financing round. Funding growth indicates investor interest in blockchain gaming projects.
DappRadar found that Web3 gaming projects raised $600 million in the third quarter of 2023. Thus, this domain’s annual investments totalled $2.3 billion. The above figure is significant, yet it represents only 30% of the total funds earned in 2022.
The third quarter saw the participation of technology startup capital firm A16z and its Speedrun accelerator program. Early-stage gaming and technology companies might get up to $75 million under this plan.
According to DappRadar, this year’s financing trend shows a remarkable distribution of cash. Investment firms received $125 million, 20.8% of total investment. Game/metaverse initiatives received $213 million, 35.5% of the money, while infrastructure projects earned $262 million, 43.6%.
The relevance of $600 million depends on one’s perspective. In the latest episode of TechCrunch Equity Monday, TechCrunch+ Editor-in-Chief Alex Wilhelm highlighted the gaming and cryptocurrency sectors’ differences. Some companies have raised significant money to integrate cryptocurrencies into the game business, but most have struggled to gain mainstream adoption.
The data shows that Web3 projects raised $600 million in the third quarter, down from $973 million in the second quarter. However, the value is close to $654 million from the fourth quarter of 2022.

Polygon was the leading blockchain platform with 39 games and 1,000+ active users. This represents 8.6% of the site’s games. The BNB Chain grew 5.3% and Ethereum 1.5%. The findings show that blockchain gaming is varied, with many platforms gaining popularity.
In September, 13 projects had token prices rise 20% or more. Nakamoto.Games was particularly popular due to an 80.4% price increase. This shows the potential for Web3 gaming developments.
Web3 gaming received eight significant investment rounds in September. ProofOfPlay, a notable firm, raised $33 million in the month’s largest financing round. Funding growth indicates investor interest in blockchain gaming projects.
DappRadar found that Web3 gaming projects raised $600 million in the third quarter of 2023. Thus, this domain’s annual investments totalled $2.3 billion. The above figure is significant, yet it represents only 30% of the total funds earned in 2022.
The third quarter saw the participation of technology startup capital firm A16z and its Speedrun accelerator program. Early-stage gaming and technology companies might get up to $75 million under this plan.
According to DappRadar, this year’s financing trend shows a remarkable distribution of cash. Investment firms received $125 million, 20.8% of total investment. Game/metaverse initiatives received $213 million, 35.5% of the money, while infrastructure projects earned $262 million, 43.6%.
The relevance of $600 million depends on one’s perspective. In the latest episode of TechCrunch Equity Monday, TechCrunch+ Editor-in-Chief Alex Wilhelm highlighted the gaming and cryptocurrency sectors’ differences. Some companies have raised significant money to integrate cryptocurrencies into the game business, but most have struggled to gain mainstream adoption.
The data shows that Web3 projects raised $600 million in the third quarter, down from $973 million in the second quarter. However, the value is close to $654 million from the fourth quarter of 2022.

After An ETF, You Just Need To Orange Pill Financial Advisors;"I wanted to write some thoughts about Bitcoin as it relates to the financial advisor industry because I think it’s a highly overlooked relationship that not many have touched on. Between the wealth management industry, financial advisors and family offices, trillions of dollars of capital is controlled. As of 2023 here are some estimates:
This is essentially the largest collective of controlled capital in the world. As a prior financial advisor I can speak from experience, the wealth management industry is riddled with misaligned incentives. Specifically, the industry’s relationship with Bitcoin as an asset has been backwards since Bitcoin's inception, however this may be about to change. 
A few comments on the wealth management space that may sound broad and un-nuanced, but I believe to be true. 
The entire wealth management and investment advisory space is built on the backbone that the “risk-free rate” is the universal benchmark which all investments should be measured against. The risk-free rate generally refers to the 10-year treasury bond’s current yield (today 4.77%). To people who have been in bitcoin for a while the concept of a risk free rate is absurd, to the other 99% of the world this is accepted as fact. As of last week total losses on US Treasuries are approaching $1.5 trillion, they don’t seem that risk free when you’re a forced seller. 
In addition, the actual rate is completely manipulated and centrally controlled by unelected actors. The result is an entire global economy making investment decisions based on a false benchmark with no ties to the free market, nobody on the planet knows what the real cost of capital is. We would argue the only thing that qualifies as “risk-free rate” is the 4 year CAGR of bitcoin in self custody (about 30% in the heart of a bear market).
This factors in the un-manipulatable monetary policy of the bitcoin network, the elimination of counterparty risk, and the free market price discovery taking bitcoin halvenings into account. All of this to say a $100 trillion industry is using the wrong benchmark.
Another point in relation to the wealth management industry is the collective misunderstanding of the CPI, widely regarded as the current inflation rate. Again, many people in bitcoin have been preaching for over a decade that this number is incredibly manipulated. 
The basket of goods that the CPI measures is frequently changed to fit narratives. 
Alternatives to measure inflation should be considered, like the increase in M2 money supply or the Chapwood Index.
Asking any person living in this country what they’re experiencing in terms of price increases for basic items would likely give you an inflation rate closer to 20% - 30%. 
The combination of these two lies proliferated throughout society is potentially the most dangerous recipe for disaster our economy has ever had. If the artificial benchmark that everything is measured against is 4.77% and the real inflation rate is something like 15% it means almost everything is negative yielding in real terms. If you denominate in USD you’re losing purchasing power almost anywhere you try to invest or store wealth, this is actually what bitcoin fixes. The wealth management industry manages $100 trillion in assets without this knowledge, that’s a very scary bubble if they find out too late. 
Lastly, the investment advisory industry is built on the concept of “fiduciary responsibility”. A fiduciary is a person or organization that acts on behalf of another person or persons, putting their clients’ interests ahead of their own, with a duty to preserve good faith and trust. Being a fiduciary thus requires being bound both legally and ethically to act in the other’s best interests. On paper, this is probably what convinces $100 trillion of value to flow into the wealth management space, in practice it’s just an industry term that is not enforced at the margins or respected. For the most part, an individual or businesses incentives will always trump a vague industry guideline. This is where I think the relationship between the wealth management space and bitcoin becomes very interesting. 
Currently, investment advisors have completely misaligned incentives related to bitcoin and I believe a spot ETF approval in the US will create an enormous shift in the opposite direction. Financial Advisors make fees for their Assets Under Management, if they want to offer a client bitcoin exposure right now, they more than likely need to send that clients money out of their book of business, and towards a separate broker, exchange, or custodian. The unfortunate truth is this has been the case since bitcoin’s inception and has not improved at all since I realized the situation in 2016-2017. If you were an independent advisor who could make your own decisions, there were bespoke ways to offer clients exposure that still ended up messy. Advisors could create a Self Directed IRA for clients which allows direct access to alternative investments like bitcoin. This was extra work and sometimes couldn’t be displayed or tracked in clients management software, this defeated the purpose as all clients wanted to do was see their entire net worth and all assets in a clean, concise UI. Advisors could also offer access to inferior products like GBTC, which trades at a premium or discount to bitcoin’s real price, and has many additional downsides which many came to realize. 
Now it should be universally understood in the bitcoin space that owning shares of a spot bitcoin ETF is not owning bitcoin. Everybody should strive to take full self custody of their bitcoin but the reality is most of the world, especially legacy finance is not there yet. With that being said, approval of a spot bitcoin ETF via Blackrock, the largest capital manager in the world, would shift legitimate bitcoin exposure into the purview of the entire wealth management industry.
Spot ETF bitcoin exposure also aligns very well with the incentives of the investment advisors. They would be able to offer access to clients the same way they allocate to equities or mutual funds. The bitcoin exposure would be displayed within a clients portfolio, and would look just like another portion of their total net worth. 
Perhaps the most important unlock is that the bitcoin Spot ETF would start to proliferate itself into the existing models that the wealth management industry relies on. In my experience, almost all investment advisors outsource allocation decisions to “experts”. The experts, as you could guess, are Blackrock, State Street, and Vanguard, essentially responsible for almost every investment model I’ve ever seen. Within these models there may be different baskets of assets, different breakdowns of risk, exposure, and sectors, but they are created by the same institutions, all chasing performance and diversification. Even legacy finance representatives that hate bitcoin for one reason or another have to admit one thing, it is the single best source of diversification in the investment world. Whether they know it yet or not, bitcoin is a hedge on sovereign credit default, it’s a hedge against centralized money printing, and it’s a hedge on the entire fiat currency system. Bitcoin offers an asymmetric investment opportunity and diversification characteristics that you simply can’t get anywhere else. For this reason, once the Spot ETF is approved it will slowly start to creep its way into the existing models that make up the capital allocation of the entire world. This may happen over years, with the Spot ETF eating .01% of a basket at a time. However, in the trojan horse of diversification, I think the bitcoin Spot ETF becomes the switch that turns on the entire Wealth Management industry to bitcoin as a must own asset in every client's portfolio.

Over 100 US Lawmakers Petition Biden To Combat Crypto-Funded Terrorism;"The Biden administration is being called upon by over 100 lawmakers in the United States to clarify its efforts at combatting global terrorist financing using cryptocurrencies.
The bipartisan letter follows reports that Hamas, the Islamist organization that launched attacks on Israeli civilians earlier this month, used crypto to raise millions of dollars over the past two years.
Citing the Wall Street Journal, lawmakers alleged that between August 2021 and June 2023, both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) raised over $130 million in crypto, of which $12 million was sent to the Islamist militant group Hezbollah this year.
“Given the clear and present danger posed by the financing of these and other militant organizations, we ask the Administration to provide additional details on its plan to prevent the use of crypto for the financing of terrorism,” the lawmakers wrote.
Some efforts to combat financing for Hezbollah and Hamas are already underway by the Israeli government. Days after the attacks took place, Binance announced that it had successfully collaborated with Israeli police in seizing over 100 Hamas-linked exchange accounts.
In June, Israel also seized $1.7 million linked to Hezbollah and Iran. Two months prior, the Hamas military wing also announced a closure of its crypto donation program due to successful efforts at prosecuting donors.
Nevertheless, lawmakers say that just a “small percentage” of crypto flowing through Hezbollah and Hamas has been seized and that the administration “must take strong action” to prevent crypto from being “used to finance another tragedy.”
Some of the letter’s requests included an estimate of how much crypto Islamist military groups currently possess, and to describe any challenges the government might face in stopping successful raises through cryptocurrency channels.
It also asked for information on which actors are facilitating such transactions, noting that most of the PIJ accounts at Binance “primarily used the stablecoin tether to transact.”
On Monday, Tether froze over $800,000 in USDT on crypto addresses with ties to terrorism in Israel and Ukraine.
Lawmakers leading the information request include U.S. Representative Sean Casten (D-Ill.) and senators Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) – the latter of whom has long criticized crypto for its roles in tax evasion, money laundering, terrorist financing, and bypassing sanctions.
In August, Warren joined a slew of Democrat senators in petitioning the Treasury and IRS to propose rules addressing an estimated $50 billion tax gap plaguing the U.S. crypto industry. In May, she also called on the Senate Banking Committee and others to combat crypto’s use in global fentanyl trading.
Between terrorism and drug trading, the U.S. Treasury is already taking action. On Wednesday, the Office of Foreign Assets Control announced sanctions against a Gaza-based Bitcoin exchange and its founder for bearing ties to Hamas.

Gary Gensler Says SEC is ‘Doing Work’ on Bitcoin ETF Filings;"The agency’s chair, Gary Gensler, has said that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is “doing work” on the host of Spot Bitcoin ETF filings they’ve received. Subsequently, when speaking with Bloomberg, Gensler said that he would not “pre-judge” applications.
The quest to get the first spot Bitcoin ETF approved in the United States has been long. Yet, there remains optimism that the agency will deviate from its string of rejections. Mike Novogratz recently stated his belief that approval would arrive at some point in 2023.
However, Gensler refused to comment on the Grayscale court case that made a landmark ruling last month. The courts ruled against the agency, requiring a re-evaluation of the previous rejection of Grayscale’s application to convert its Bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund.

The digital asset industry has seen a host of companies seek the creation of the United States’ first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF. Yet, the SEC has been entrenched in its position against its creation. However, traditional finance firms like Fidelity and BlackRock have still sought to submit applications that could sway their opinions. 
Now, speaking to Bloomberg, the agency chair, Gary Gensler, has said that the agency is “doing work” on the Bitcoin ETF applications. Moreover, during the interview, he stated that he would not “pre-judge” during the process. Thereafter, Gensler refused to comment on this agency’s court defeat to Grayscale, in which the rejection of their application would be rescinded.

“What we have in front of us, just so that the viewing public understands, we have not one, but multiple; I think its eight or ten filings that the staff, and ultimately the Commission, is considering,” Gensler told Bloomberg. When an asset manager is seeking to take something public, these exchange-traded products need to register with the SEC, and they go through a filing somewhat similar to going public, like an IPO.” 
Additionally, Gensler stated that the agency’s Division of Corporation Finance and Division of Trading and Markets look at the filings and give feedback. Then, he noted that the Disclosure Review Team will give their opinion in what he called a “time-tested process that goes back decades.”

Bitcoin’s Dominance Keeps Rising Despite BTC’s Failed Attempt at $29K (Market Watch);"Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down the $29,000 level once again hours ago but was stopped in its tracks and currently sits several hundred dollars below it.
However, its dominance over the altcoins keeps rising to new multi-month peaks, as most of the alts are sitting in the red now.
BTC’s price performance was quite dull during the weekend, with the asset trading sideways at around $27,000. However, it couldn’t overcome that level until Monday morning. That’s when the bulls took control of the market and pushed the cryptocurrency north by a grand.
More price gains came later that day following a fake report that the SEC had finally greenlighted a spot Bitcoin ETF in the States. The asset reacted with an immediate surge that pushed it north by $2,000 to a two-month high.
As the report was refuted, though, the cryptocurrency started losing value somewhat rapidly and came back down to $28,000. It reacted well to this retracement and spiked to $29,000 hours ago.
Nevertheless, the bears intercepted the move, and BTC now trades about $500 away from it. Its market capitalization, though, is up to $557 billion, and its dominance over the altcoins has pumped again to a new local peak of over 51% on CMC.
The rising BTC dominance means that most altcoins have either failed to produce any substantial gains or have lost ground within the past 24 hours. Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Ripple stand in the first corner, while Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, Polygon, Polkadot, and Litecoin are in the second one.
Toncoin is among the few alts with a notable price increase. TON is up by over 5% and trades above $2.
With most other lower- and mid-cap alts trading in the red today, the total crypto market cap has failed to overcome the coveted $1.1 trillion level and sits below it now.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Ordinals Don’t Matter: Jimmy Song Talks Bitcoin (BTC Amsterdam Interview);"Jimmy Song is among the names in the Bitcoin landscape that doesn’t require an introduction. He has been involved with the BTC ecosystem for about a decade, from being a developer and supporter of the network to publishing several books on the matter, trying to educate the masses about Bitcoin’s advantages, whether in terms of developers or retail investors.
CryptoPotato had the chance to speak with Song during the Bitcoin Conference 2023 in Amsterdam, where we talked about various BTC-related topics, such as Ordinals, ETFs, the blockchain’s future, and others like inflation and money printing.
Whether or not the US will finally have a spot Bitcoin ETF has been on the minds of many, with some, such as Edward Snowden, refusing to accept a possible approval for a positive development while others believe such a product will help legitimize the cryptocurrency, especially for institutional investors.
Speaking on the matter, Jimmy Song said he stands in the “I don’t care camp.”
“A lot of people are wanting it to mean something and just because it has been sort of a promise for a long time. However, we have had futures ETFs for a while now in the US. We’ve had spot ETFs all over the world for a while now.”
He acknowledged the fact that some institutional investors will be able to have an easier entrance to the BTC ecosystem, but they will also have the option to employ short ETFs, which is “going to be very dangerous” since redemptions of the spot product will have to be delivered in actual Bitcoin.
While opining on another hot topic from earlier this year – Bitcoin Ordinals – Song categorized them as a “normal pump and dump.” He believes such schemes typically take place on altcoins, such as the DeFi summer and the NFT craze – both of which were primarily on Ethereum.
This time, it was on Bitcoin, which was the unexpected part. Nevertheless, the author of five BTC books believes the hype around the Ordinals has “already come and gone,” and he added that “I don’t think it matters at all.”
In his first interview with us from five years ago, Song said he wears his famous cowboy hat to showcase that the Bitcoin industry is in the Wild West era as it lacked regulations and any real adoption. When asked five years later if he had seen any developments on the matter, Song, who was still wearing the cowboy hat, said:
“I would say we are still in it, but maybe a little bit later in the Wild West era, when you had bounties and stuff like that. But I think in the past five years, we saw just so many scams, and nothing sort of encapsulates that more than Sam Bankman-Fried, who’s now on trial. So some of the wildness is being reined in, especially by the authorities with the prosecution of SBF, but also just more regulation in general.”
When it comes down to Bitcoin specifically, Song said, “I have seen a lot of regulators sort of recognize that it’s very different than everything else.”
Separately, Song said five years ago that he believed a lot more people would look for “freedomish” assets like Bitcoin within the next 15 years, which would strengthen BTC’s adoption curve. With governments using the COVID-19 pandemic to implement more control on the global population and the imminent launch of CBDCs, we asked Song whether he still has the same projection on the future of Bitcoin.
He admitted that most people “gave in” a bit too easily when the pandemic broke out, and especially when the vaccines were introduced. The controversial results and reports since then are making people ask themselves whether they would undertake the same steps as they did a few years ago when everything was so new to us.
As such, Song believes most people will be looking for alternatives and better education before making such big decisions. In terms of CBDCs, he said many will comply with them once they are fully launched, but a large chunk of the population has become a lot more skeptical. This was exemplified by the Canadian truckers, the farmer protests in a few European countries, and other similar events.
He added that the whole process of people seeking alternatives and becoming more freedom-minded is a long one:
“So, maybe it’s not 10 or 20 years, but 50 years from now, I think you are going to see a population that’s way more freedom-minded.”
When trying to fight the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, world governments essentially closed almost everything – from small and large businesses to people in their homes. In some countries, this was done for weeks, while in others – months and even years.
To alleviate some of the financial pressure, authorities, especially in the Western world, decided to print tons of fiat money and distribute them among their population. Whether that was successful or not is hard to determine, but the impact on the global economy is seen with inflation skyrocketing across the globe. Of course, some governments are trying to place the blame on the Ukraine-Russia war or something else.
In his fifth and latest book focusing on Bitcoin’s advantages, Song weighed in on the matter, which is evident by its title – Fiat Ruins Everything.
He asserted that it is aimed at a different audience than his previous books – this one is “squarely” for Bitcoiners – “the people that already own Bitcoin, and to help them understand how bad the fiat corruption has gotten and to sort of rally the troops a little bit. This is the anthem, a way to understand just what kind of a corrupt system they are escaping through Bitcoin.”

Crypto Market Analysis: Here’s What’s Next for Bitcoin, Ethereum & Altcoins;"The post Crypto Market Analysis: Here’s What’s Next for Bitcoin, Ethereum & Altcoins appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The global crypto market cap witnessed a notable rise in the past few days, as the levels are now raised beyond $1.09 trillion. Despite a drop in trading volume in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin’s price is able to sustain above $28,000. Besides, the Ethereum price trades above $1500, while the other tokens in the top 10 are trying hard to materialize decent gains. 
In times when market sentiments are closer to making a notable shift from being pessimistic to optimistic, the possibility of a bearish turn-down could hinder the progress of the rally for a while. A popular analyst, anonymously known as Colin Talks Crypto, believes that the BTC price could drop below $24,000 while the ETH/BTC pair could make new lows in the next several months. 
Referring to the above chart, Colin Talks Crypto believes the BTC price could complete its head and shoulder pattern. With this, the price could drop to levels between $18,000 and $23,000, which is likely to happen by the end of 2023 or the very beginning of 2024. Moreover, the analyst also believes the Bitcoin spot ETF could get approved sometime after the crash, causing a huge ‘God Candle’ recording a minimum $10,000 jump. 
While the BTC price is undergoing some compression, the analyst believes the ETH/BTC could get decimated and drop to new lows somewhere between 0.035 and 0.045. As no Ethereum ETF is getting approved, all the liquidity will FOMO into Bitcoin first, pushing the ETHBTC pair down. However, approval may be expected after the ETH/BTC ratio hits new lows. In the meantime, the other altcoins are also expected to make new lows against Bitcoin. Therefore, the Bitcoin price prediction for 2023 and for the beginning of 2024 appears to be bearish at present.

Binance’s EUR Trading Volume Crashes To 3-Year Low, What Happened?;"In October 2023, EUR-denominated weekly spot volume on Binance, a top cryptocurrency exchange, fell to $160 million, an 88% drop from $1.3 billion recorded seven months earlier in March 2023. At this level, EUR trading volume on the besieged exchange is at a three-year low, pointing to how consequential the decision by regulators to crack down on the platform has been this year. 
According to Kaiko, on October 18, the contraction was worsened by Paysafe’s decision to terminate its partnership with the exchange by the end of September 2023. 
Following this move, clients in the European zone had no options to swap their tokens for Euro. Instead, they had to exit to other cryptocurrencies, mostly the USDT and Bitcoin (BTC), two of the zone’s most liquid assets supported by the exchange’s subsidiaries.
Paysafe didn’t explain why they were terminating their collaboration with Binance. However, considering the increased regulatory pressure on crypto exchanges, especially by agencies in the United States and Europe, Paysafe likely wanted to play safe and not damage its reputation by being associated with the on-siege exchange. 
Additionally, with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) set for implementation in the coming months, crypto exchanges must comply with complex regulations to increase transparency and protect users. Subsequently, Paysafe might have found it challenging to comply with all expected regulations while servicing Binance, necessitating the pullout.
Beyond Paysafe termination, Binance has been exiting various European countries. Recently, Binance sold its Russian subsidiary to CommEx. In late July, the exchange also left Germany, citing challenges with licensing. 
According to the exchange, they “proactively withdrew” their Bafin application after the German regulator declined to grant the exchange a license in June. Around the same month, Binance said they were exiting the Netherlands after failing to secure a virtual asset service provider license from Dutch regulators.
While Binance has scaled down on its European operations, the exchange has a presence in several countries, including Spain, Italy, and France. The French regulator, Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF), has already licensed the exchange, but updates will be made from January 1, 2024. Approved ramps in France, including Binance and Bitstamp, must reapply before MiCA takes effect.
On October 17, Binance said it would stop accepting new clients in the United Kingdom in compliance with the Financial Conduct Authority’s rules. New regulations implemented by the FCA on October 8 prohibit unlicensed crypto firms from advertising services to clients in the country.

Will Cardano Slide To $0.20? What Awaits ADA Investors This Week;"Cardano (ADA) investors are currently grappling with a critical juncture as the cryptocurrency struggles to maintain its positive momentum within a triangle pattern. 
Priced at $0.246925 according to CoinGecko, the ADA market is currently navigating through a complex landscape of potential pitfalls and prospects. 
Despite a 1.3% decline in the last 24 hours and a measly 0.1% dip over the past week, the market sentiment remains cautious, with traders closely monitoring the possibility of a downturn to $0.20.
At the heart of the current ADA price conundrum lies the intricate triangle pattern, a technical formation that often signifies a period of market indecision and potential trend reversal. 
Within this pattern, the coin’s price movements are constrained between a converging support trendline and a resistance trendline. 
The ongoing struggle to sustain a positive cycle hints at a potential bullish breakout. However, the looming threat of a significant plunge to $0.20 keeps many traders at the edge of their seats, anxiously observing the market dynamics.
Adding to the air of caution, renowned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has sounded an alarm for ADA investors, issuing a grave warning regarding the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. 
In a recent tweet, Cowen highlighted ADA’s declining value in terms of Bitcoin (BTC), predicting a potential drop to as low as 400 satoshis. 
#ADA / #BTC is breaking down, probably headed to 400 sats pic.twitter.com/ZwYZ0dxS4h
— Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) October 16, 2023
Cowen’s warning stems from an in-depth analysis of ADA’s price chart, which revealed a troubling trend that has sent ripples of concern across the market.
According to Cowen’s analysis, Cardano experienced a critical breakthrough of a key trendline, triggering a phase of accumulation before entering a subsequent downtrend. 
Despite a brief consolidation phase, ADA’s gradual departure from this period led to the erosion of vital support levels. 
Currently valued at 890 satoshis per ADA, Cowen anticipates a staggering 50% drop from its present level, urging investors to tread cautiously in the volatile ADA market.

Underlying ADA’s price turmoil is the persistent battle between resistance and support levels. The crucial support at $0.24 has provided a temporary foothold for the cryptocurrency, preventing a more precipitous decline. 
However, multiple lower-high formations resulting from overhead bearish pressure have cast a shadow over ADA’s short-term prospects, creating a challenging environment for sustained bullish momentum.
Despite these obstacles, ADA’s price action continues to reflect a tenacious effort to resist the downward pressure and retain a foothold within the symmetrical triangle. 
Yet, the looming threat of a potential downtrend breaking below the support trendline remains a tangible concern for traders and investors alike. 
As the crypto community awaits further developments, the fate of Cardano’s price trajectory hangs delicately in the balance, with investors bracing for potential fluctuations in the days ahead.

Met Police unmask crypto’s role in crime syndicates;"The Met Police have dug deep into the shadows, highlighting the intertwining tendrils of cryptocurrency in the dark world of organized crime. 
The prominence of digital coins in illicit activities has evolved from being a mere sidenote to being at the epicenter of transactions, from trafficking to trading.
Cryptocurrency, often lauded for its decentralized and transparent nature, is now getting an unsavory reputation. The Met Police, London’s premier law enforcement body, has been spearheading efforts to unmask these cyber culprits. 
Just a year ago, the thought of assembling a crypto-focused investigation team might’ve seemed excessive. Today, this team stands strong with about 40 experts dedicated to unearthing crypto-related misdeeds.
Detective Inspector Geoff Donoghue paints a grim picture: where they expected to find traditional traces of crime, they often stumbled upon its digital counterpart. 
Whether it’s the trade of illicit substances or human trafficking, cryptocurrency has inarguably anchored itself within these operations. 
Since May, the Met’s specialized team has been hard at work, and their investigations have rapidly piled up, with 19 currently active criminal probes.
The broader digital currency industry isn’t enjoying smoother waters either. It’s been riddled with enforcement actions, some even culminating in high-profile lawsuits against industry giants like Coinbase and Binance. 
Let’s not forget the swift action by Israeli authorities earlier this month, shutting down numerous crypto accounts believed to be supporting terrorist endeavors.
Digital criminal activities aren’t limited to organized crime. The realm of ransomware and identity theft is another battleground. 
A report by Israeli firm AU10TIX, which collaborates with tech giants like Google and Microsoft, indicated a surge in identity fraud targeting the crypto sector.
Despite the volatility of digital currency values, crime rates remain unswayed. Detective Sergeant Mat Stanley from the Met’s cybercrime unit drives home a stark reality: fluctuations in Bitcoin or Ether prices don’t deter transactions. 
A deal remains a deal, regardless of the conversion rate.
While the Met is making strides on the crime front, the UK is grappling with cryptocurrency on the policy front. The digital revolution has left legislators at a crossroads. 
Earlier this year, the government hinted at plans to align crypto regulations with that of traditional financial instruments.
However, the proposal wasn’t free from opposition, as some parliamentarians vociferously argued for classifying cryptocurrencies along the lines of gambling.
Further complicating matters is the UK’s ambition to position London as a crypto epicenter, juxtaposed with the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) rigorous crypto promotional standards. 
These rules aren’t just stringent; they pack a punch, threatening promoters with hefty fines and possible jail time if they overstep. City minister Andrew Griffith made headlines when he called for restraint just before these stringent regulations were enacted. 
But with the FCA dispatching over 150 alerts on unauthorized crypto promotions and giants like Binance halting new UK customer registrations, it’s clear that the country’s regulatory tango with cryptocurrency is far from over.
To sum it up, the Met Police’s revelations offer a hard-hitting reminder. While cryptocurrency holds immense potential, it’s impossible to turn a blind eye to its growing role in organized crime. For London and the wider world, the road to regulation, transparency, and safety seems long and arduous.

The Met Police have dug deep into the shadows, highlighting the intertwining tendrils of cryptocurrency in the dark world of organized crime. 
The prominence of digital coins in illicit activities has evolved from being a mere sidenote to being at the epicenter of transactions, from trafficking to trading.
Cryptocurrency, often lauded for its decentralized and transparent nature, is now getting an unsavory reputation. The Met Police, London’s premier law enforcement body, has been spearheading efforts to unmask these cyber culprits.

BTC Price Analysis: How Changes In US 10-Year Treasury Yields Influence Bitcoin’s Tide?;"The post BTC Price Analysis: How Changes In US 10-Year Treasury Yields Influence Bitcoin’s Tide? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Bitcoin has recently displayed signs of a significant price movement, as the market has started experiencing irregular price fluctuations. Bulls are constantly fighting to gain momentum over the bears and have steadily begun to achieve it as the Bitcoin price is now rising.
Last week, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury raised to 4.88% for the first time since 2007, while the 30-year offering breached 5.05%, also claiming a 16-year peak. Both have backed up recently due to external factors such as increased geopolitical risk.
An increase in the Treasury yield means a falling demand for treasury bonds, which can be a negative point for the market as investors prefer higher risk in the hope of higher rewards.
The US 10-Year Treasury Yield has surged to the highest level in 16 years! What does it mean for the market?• A high 10-year Treasury yield can increase the cost of borrowing for businesses and individuals, particularly for long-term loans like mortgages. • This can… pic.twitter.com/G16pqL5TQW
Moreover, issuers can now increase the cost of borrowing for personal and professional reasons, specifically for long-term loans such as mortgages, as rising bond yields make borrowing more expensive. 
The increased treasury yield is expected to exert significant downward pressure on Bitcoin price. A surge in yield typically signifies market sentiments of an extended Federal Reserve interest rate hike policy, which is considered unfavorable for high-risk investment assets such as cryptocurrencies.
This is also an opportunity for Bitcoin as the next Halving is approaching. BTC is here as a substitute for the traditional payment system, and increasing rate hikes and inflation are diluting the value of money. Hence, it can present itself as an alternative as the supply is limited and cannot be governed by a body.
The market is highly unpredictable as major currencies are struggling to gain stability. Bitcoin is a sign of economic health and resilience by one set of people and a risky move by the other.
In conclusion, the present change in the yield on the 10-year US Treasury is not expected to impact Bitcoin on a significant level, and the price may only experience a minor hiccup, as BTC price is steadily gaining momentum and is preparing itself well for the upcoming Halving.

Bullish Bitcoin Forecast: 570% Rally On The Horizon, Expert Trader Says;"Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi, renowned for their accurate predictions in the cryptocurrency market, has once again sparked excitement among Bitcoin enthusiasts with a bold forecast. 
Pentoshi believes that Bitcoin (BTC) is on the cusp of a parabolic surge, driven by the inevitable return of money printing by the US government. This prediction comes as the government grapples with an overwhelming debt burden of $33.523 trillion.
In a recent post on the social media platform X, Pentoshi outlined the foundation of their forecast. They pointed out that when the US government resorts to debasing the dollar to address its staggering debt, the king coin is poised to shine. 
When the printers come back to inflate away debt, and they will and always have
Just remember $BTC is fundamentally the hardest asset in the world with both a programmatic monetary policy and fixed supply
There’s always another cycle pic.twitter.com/zYGss16Mm8

“When the printers come back to inflate away debt, and they will and always have,” Pentoshi noted, “Just remember, BTC is fundamentally the hardest asset in the world with both a programmatic monetary policy and fixed supply. There’s always another cycle.”
Pentoshi’s confidence in Bitcoin’s resilience and value proposition is underpinned by its inherent characteristics. Bitcoin operates with a fixed supply, making it immune to inflationary pressures that affect traditional fiat currencies. This rarity and its decentralized nature have made it an attractive store of value in times of economic uncertainty.
Taking a look at Pentoshi’s chart, it reveals a compelling projection. The analyst foresees Bitcoin rallying to a new all-time high of $180,000, representing a staggering 570% increase from its current price. While the prediction is bound to raise eyebrows, it’s essential to remember that the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and such meteoric rises have occurred in the past.

However, it’s not all smooth sailing, as Pentoshi also points out some uncertainties. The timing of the Federal Reserve’s decision to start cutting interest rates remains uncertain. 
 Pentoshi cautions: 
Currently, the price of BTC, as reported by CoinGecko, stands at $28,212.87. In the last 24 hours, it has recorded a 1.1% gain, and over the past seven days, it has seen a 2.2% increase. These minor fluctuations are par for the course in the world of cryptocurrency, where prices can be highly volatile.
Recent market events have also contributed to Bitcoin’s price swings. The alpha coin had been on a trajectory towards $30,000, but its ascent was abruptly halted after BlackRock denied rumors of a cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Such an ETF would have allowed market participants to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of holding the asset themselves.
The concept of a Bitcoin ETF has long been a point of contention in the financial world. Regulatory approval of a Bitcoin ETF would mark a watershed moment in the broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies. It would lend legitimacy to a product that has been the subject of debate and skepticism, making it more accessible to a wider range of investors.

FTX Stakes About $170 Million in SOL, ETH, and MATIC Amidst SBF’s Trial;"The bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange has staked close to $170 million in several crypto assets, including Solana, Ethereum, and MATIC.
Blockchain data revealed that the defunct platform has staked over 5.5 million SOL and more than 24K ETH.
Staking is primarily the practice of locking up cryptocurrencies on a blockchain network to support it and earning token rewards, mainly at a predetermined rate.
#CryptoNews: Over 5.5 million #Solana (SOL) were sent by an #FTX-identified wallet to #Figment, a staking validator service catering to institutional investors. https://t.co/gSXPVBeGwz
— CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) October 16, 2023

According to blockchain data, FTX has staked approximately 5.5 million SOL, valued at around $122 million, into the Figmen network. This strategic move is anticipated to yield significant returns, with an estimated annual yield of 6.79%, potentially resulting in compounded tokens worth $8 million over time.
In terms of the 24K ETH tokens, valued at $37.4 million, FTX has directly staked these assets onto the Ethereum network based on transaction details. As of now, the estimated return stands at 3.4%, equivalent to $1 million worth of Ethereum.
In addition to SOL and Ethereum, reports indicate that FTX has also staked MATIC, the native token of Polygon. Approximately $9.5 million worth of MATIC has been staked. However, current data analytics suggest that only around 13.5 million MATIC, valued at approximately $6.8 million, has been staked so far, with a capped return of 4.6%.
The analysis of the tokens reveals that the amounts were primarily held in addresses controlled by FTX’s sister company, Alameda Research.
The relationship between Solana and FTX dates back to the pre-bankruptcy era, during which the exchange held approximately $1.16 billion worth of SOL tokens at one point.
The recent staking activities by FTX are a result of a recent ruling where the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware granted the exchange permission to invest and hedge its crypto holdings worth $3.4 billion.
As per reports, the holdings included $685 million in Solana tokens, $529 million in FTT, $268 million in Bitcoin, and $90 million in ETH. The exchange also held some amounts in Polygon, Aptos, XRP, Dogecoin, and certain stablecoins.
Another legal battle involving FTX continues, this time being that of the failed exchange’s former head, Sam Bankman Fried. The ex-CEO is charged with fraud and misappropriation of billions in customers’ funds.
In fact, in the recent proceedings, FTX’s ex-lead engineer, Nishad Singh, highlighted some significant questionable money and investment decisions made by FTX under the leadership of SBF.

Loom Network Price Dips Despite Market Upturn, While Traders Back This New Penny Crypto to Surge;"Loom Network is down a staggering 22% over the past 24 hours. The downturn follows a broader market uptick and Loom’s price exploding in recent weeks. Could this be a mere pullback, or is its price destined to collapse further?
Meanwhile, some traders agree that the new Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) project is set to boom once it hits exchanges. Currently, investors can buy it at presale, but they must be quick as it is selling out fast.

Loom Network seemed to be a dormant and forgotten crypto over the past years, unable to reclaim its 2018 all-time high (ATH) in the 2021 bull rally. However, unsuspecting events have propelled it to become a trending crypto, surging 7x and overtaking its 2021 high despite turbulent market conditions.
That said, as the rest of the market has begun to pump recently, Loom Network has struggled tremendously, plunging from $0.48 to $0.3 since 15 October and down -22% in 24 hours.
Analysts have weighed in on what might have caused the collapse. X (formerly Twitter) user 0x_Lens alluded that the recent pump may have been “Next-level manipulation by exchanges,” noting the project is “dead” and has a low market cap.
Meanwhile, victorious__5 shares the abovementioned bearish sentiment. The trader states that shorting Loom is the best decision, referencing “Typical PCSN with max negative funding and someone owning 50% of the supply started selling today.
Concerns regarding Loom’s distribution have been circulating for a while but come to light as blockchain analytics account Lookonchain discovered that a wallet holding 47.5% of the LOOM supply has begun selling.
According to the tweet, this wallet is suspected to belong to the crypto exchange Upbit. This is also what 0x_Lens referred to regarding manipulation by exchanges.
Interestingly, data from the analytics platform Santiment shows that developer activity on Loom Network has diminished to almost zero over the past years. This indicates significant inactivity, meaning that the pump is unlikely to sustain.

Moving to technical analysis, Loom is trading at 73 on the RSI despite its strong sell-off. This is within the overbought territory and could indicate further downside momentum if it aligns with other technical indicators.
Meanwhile, the price has broken below its weekly volume weighted average price (VWAP) range, a bearish signal hinting at a move downward.

Considering the market’s bearish sentiment, its shrinking developer community and technical indicators pointing to a downside continuation, Loom currently holds significant risk.
One new project which does currently look bullish, though, is Bitcoin Minetrix, which has raised $1.6m via its ICO.
Bitcoin Minetrix is a new Ethereum-based platform enabling users to mine Bitcoin by effortlessly staking $BTCMTX tokens. This groundbreaking concept provides a no-fuss, no-expertize needed way for anyone to begin earning free Bitcoin.
As such, its presale has exploded, raising $1.6 million in three weeks. The first presale round sold out in a flash, and it is currently in round two of ten, with investors able to grab $BTCMTX at just $0.0111.

They must be quick, though, since the price will increase by 10% in each round, with the next scheduled when the presale hits $3 million.
Traders are massively bullish on Bitcoin Minetrix. Prominent YouTuber Michael Wrubel, who boasts 300K subscribers, recently predicted significant potential for the project.
According to Wrubel, one of Bitcoin Minetrix’s most significant advantages is that the decentralized and transparent $BTCMTX token eradicates cloud mining security risks, which have become prevalent in the industry.
Bitcoin Minetrix has been audited by Coinsult, bolstering its reputation and trust among crypto investors.
The project is also running a $30K airdrop to celebrate its presale. Community members get up to seven entrees by completing easy tasks like following Bitcoin Minetrix on X.
These factors play an instrumental role in the wildly successful presale. However, with it quickly selling out, potential investors must not wait around.

Loom Network is down a staggering 22% over the past 24 hours. The downturn follows a broader market uptick and Loom’s price exploding in recent weeks. Could this be a mere pullback, or is its price destined to collapse further?
Meanwhile, some traders agree that the new Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) project is set to boom once it hits exchanges. Currently, investors can buy it at presale, but they must be quick as it is selling out fast.

Loom Network seemed to be a dormant and forgotten crypto over the past years, unable to reclaim its 2018 all-time high (ATH) in the 2021 bull rally. However, unsuspecting events have propelled it to become a trending crypto, surging 7x and overtaking its 2021 high despite turbulent market conditions.
That said, as the rest of the market has begun to pump recently, Loom Network has struggled tremendously, plunging from $0.48 to $0.3 since 15 October and down -22% in 24 hours.

Bloomberg Analyst Issues Bitcoin Warning, Says BTC ‘Coiled to Move’ – Here’s His Forecast;"A Bloomberg analyst is issuing a warning to traders, saying that Bitcoin (BTC) is winding up to make a big move.
Bloomberg Intelligence’s senior macro strategist Mike McGlone tells his 61,300 followers on the social media platform X that the king crypto is as “coiled” up in between a narrow range between major moving averages, suggesting volatility in the near future.
“Risks of short cleansing, the morning of Oct. 16.
Bitcoin’s narrowing $25,000-$29,000 cage; breakout ramifications – 
Stuck between its 50- and 100-week moving averages with annual volatility falling to a new low, Bitcoin is about as coiled to move as it gets.”
According to McGlone, BTC is bound for a major move – the only question is the direction. He says that BTC is more likely to collapse to the downside than to rally.
“It’s a question of direction, and my bias is downward along with a top measure of liquidity: fed fund futures in one year…
What’s typically been a prerequisite for this liquidity indicator to turn positive is Bitcoin falling first. If the 24/7-traded, highly speculative crypto leading indicator can sustain above its downward sloping 100-week mean, it might portend risk-on, inflation and more central bank restraint. 
This may be part of the lose-lose for risk assets with the Fed bias still tightening amid late-stage economic cycle leanings. Showing broad market complacency, Bitcoin volatility vs. the 500 is about 2.8x to Oct. 13 and above the 1.9x low from Q4 2020.”
In a recent interview with crypto influencer Scott Melker, the strategist reiterates his position.
“Bitcoin goes up in the liquidity and does well when the stock market’s doing well and then it goes down the other way. So here’s what I think’s going to happen: they’re both going to go down.”
BTC is worth $28,475 at time of writing.

Bitcoin At Risk Of 50% Drop Before Next Halving If Historical Trend Repeats, Warns Influential Crypto Guru;"
Bitcoin hit a two-month high earlier today following amendments to a spot ETF application by Fidelity, but some forecasts still see the alpha cryptocurrency dropping considerably in the coming months before the next halving. Renowned crypto YouTuber Benjamin Cowen doesn’t rule out a 50% Bitcoin price correction based on historical patterns.
If you are expecting Bitcoin to soar in the lead-up to the halving, you’re in for a rude shock.
In his latest interview with Scott Melker, analyst Benjamin Cowen pointed out that BTC has historically plummeted by 50% before going through a halving event.
Roughly every four years, the Bitcoin rewards the miners receive for successfully mining a block are slashed in half as a way of controlling the blockchain’s supply economics. This event is known as the halving and is often considered a positive catalyst for the price of Bitcoin as it lessens inflationary pressure on the benchmark crypto. The next halving is set to happen around April 2024.
While he didn’t explicitly forecast a 50% retracement, historical data doesn’t favor BTC bulls:
“Look, last cycle, what we always see, everyone talks about the Bitcoin halving. I’ve seen this for the last several cycles. Everyone talks about it and what normally happens is Bitcoin halves [in price] before the halving and then people are like, ‘Oh, well, that’s what the halving meant.”’
Cowen highlights previous market cycles to support his point, noting the drop that happened ahead of the pandemic and the one before that. During these instances, the price of Bitcoin saw a 50% drawdown before commencing a parabolic bull run.
The similarity of these declines, especially the ones that began in the summer, led Cowen to contemplate whether the current market could be on the brink of a 50% fall. If so, traders should prepare for more pain as BTC can potentially nosedive to $15,000 levels.
One of the main reasons behind Cowen’s gloomy prediction is the waning liquidity within the crypto market and most risk assets markets.
“And that’s my concern for Bitcoin, is that liquidity is leaving the altcoin market. The purchasing power of these altcoins are going down and at some point, I think that affects Bitcoin. Look at the total market cap. If there were a lot of new money coming into the space, why is the total market cap the same as it was back in February and the same as it was back in August 2022?
As liquidity diminishes, Bitcoin can become more vulnerable to steep drops. This has historically been a harbinger of huge market movements, and the crypto influencer and founder of IntoTheCryptoverse thinks this time will be no different.
Cowen’s warning comes at a time when the crypto market has been characterized by increased volatility, particularly after the fake ETF approval debacle, and market participants are keenly observing the movements of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value.

Is Now a Good Time to Buy XRP? A Closer Look at the Ripple Price (Analysis);"TL;DR

Ripple’s march towards a possible decisive court victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the numerous developments surrounding the blockchain enterprise, and the enhanced volatility of XRP have given bulls hopes that the asset’s price could rise significantly in the near future.
Numerous analysts have laid out plenty of forecasts lately, with some envisioning mild increases and others predicting spectacular spikes. The most recent wild bet came from the X (Twitter) user EGRAG CRYPTO, who assumed that the community might witness XRP trading at a whopping $27 in less than three years.
The prognosis is based on the so-called “Elliott Wave Theory,” which has five progressive cycles. EGRAG CRYPTO suggested that “Wave 3” could be a “game-changer,” assuming XRP manages to enter that phase.
“Wave 3 emerges as the trend’s dominant force, eclipsing other waves in size and influence. Wave 3 often extends Wave 1 by a ratio of approximately 1.618, painting a promising picture for XRP’s future,” they explained.
However, the analyst reminded that Ripple’s native token is still within the initial phase, known as “Wave 1,” and entering the bullish mode could happen at the beginning of 2024. The valuation then might pass through enhanced volatility by spiking towards $10 and then plunging to as low as $1.50. Eventually, it could blast towards the $27 level in Q4 2025.
As such, EGRAG CRYPTO argued that investing in the coin as of the moment (when the price is less than $0.50) “might just be the wisest move for generations to come.”
It is worth noting that such a price tag seems a bit unrealistic, considering the fact that XRP’s market capitalization should jump to approximately $1.5 trillion for this to happen. Recall that the market cap of the entire cryptocurrency industry was around $3 trillion during the bull run in 2021 when Bitcoin (BTC) soared to an ATH of almost $70,000.
Those willing to find out what XRP’s possible deviation in the short term might be could take a look at our latest video below:

Going Off-Chain To Turbocharge Asset Swaps Across Exchanges;"Every blockchain has a scalability problem, as they struggle under the weight of increased workloads as their user bases grow. When we talk about scalability, we’re referring to the blockchain’s ability to process a high volume of transactions at reasonable speed. 
Blockchains must find a way to achieve high scalability if cryptocurrencies are ever to become mainstream. Otherwise, we will reach a point at which they can no longer process everyone’s transactions in good time. If they cannot do this, users will reject blockchains and continue to use traditional payment mechanisms. 
So far, blockchains have proven themselves to be inadequate. The world’s most famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin is well known for processing transactions at a snail’s pace, with its scalability limited to a miserable 7 transactions per second. Ethereum doesn’t do much better, with its 20 TPS rate. Compare this to Visa, which can process a whopping 24,000 TPS, and it’s clear that blockchains have a major problem. 
There are a number of factors that determine the scalability of blockchains. The major one is their throughput, which is a measure of how many actions they can perform over a certain period of time. In the case of blockchains, transaction throughput relates to the speed at which they can validate and add transactions. 
Meanwhile, the blockchain network itself has an impact on scalability. Blockchains are decentralized networks made up of hundreds, if not thousands of individual nodes, and every transaction that is mined must be broadcast to the others. Doing this requires a lot of time and resources, and often leads to delays in block confirmation and consequently, network congestion. 
Another issue relates to capacity. Blockchains are a ledger that records every transaction ever made, and the more they grow, the more data they store. The more this data increases, the greater the storage resources required by each node. As such, it’s not only throughput that determines blockchain scalability. For instance, if we were to speed up Bitcoin’s throughput to 1,000 TPS, it still wouldn’t scale because of the time it takes to confirm each block. 
It’s also necessary to mention the age-old “blockchain trilemma”, which refers to the fact that blockchains cannot achieve decentralization, security and scalability at the same time. The architecture of blockchains means that one must always be sacrificed in order to achieve the other two. This is because blockchains are peer-to-peer networks. We’ve already mentioned that an increase in nodes has a negative impact on scalability. But if we decrease the number of nodes, this results in a more centralized network that’s inherently less secure. Because decentralization and security are so essential to the belief in Web3, it’s usually always scalability that gets sacrificed. 
Numerous scaling solutions have been proposed and implemented to help blockchains achieve the scale necessary for wider adoption, and many of the most promising ideas involve processing transactions off-chain in order to reduce network congestion. 
Many of these Layer-2 scaling solutions work great for individual users and decentralized applications, but they can be complex to implement in the crypto trading world, where numerous exchange platforms require a way to process high volume transactions with one another at near instantaneous speeds. 
To solve the problem of cross-chain asset swapping between exchanges, a more advanced solution is required and for that, we can turn to the Layer-3 network Yellow. 
Yellow has created a cross-chain and peer-to-peer network overlay that can facilitate transactions between numerous parties at once by pooling available liquidity from many different networks and participants. It acts as a kind of clearing house for centralized and decentralized exchanges to trade with one another off-chain using state channels. 
The constituents of Yellow’s architecture include a Financial Information Exchange, which serves as a relay network that enables CEXs, DEXs and other brokers to send messages that facilitate individual transactions between one another. The Electronic Communication Network optimizes buy and sell order matching for these participants, while state channels are opened to facilitate the rapid off-chain exchange of assets. When opening a state channel, each participant must deposit collateral within its governing smart contract to cover the balance of all of the traders they plan to make.
Yellow provides a way for numerous parties to engage in high volume trading with immediate finality, with its state channels aiding scalability by only settling the final “state”, or balance at the end of a string of transactions, on the blockchain when it’s closed. Using state channels, governed by Yellow’s architecture, exchanges can essentially perform an unlimited number of cross-chain asset swaps without overwhelming the underlying blockchains. Because the final transaction is recorded onto the blockchain, the system remains as secure as the blockchain itself. 
Within a state channel, each individual transaction is signed by both parties and settled immediately, off-chain, with a smart contract keeping a track of the balance. To close a channel, all participants are required to sign the final transaction before the sum of all of those transactions is verified by the blockchain. 
The beauty of state channels is that each message contains something known as a “nonce”, which can be thought of as a timestamp. Using the nonces, the smart contract can understand the chronological order in which each message, signed by all counterparties, was sent. The smart contract will always settle the state based on the final message that’s signed by all participants within the channel. This prevents foul play, such as one party attempting to close the state channel with an earlier message that doesn’t reflect the true balance of all of the transactions. 
By utilizing state channels as a Layer-3 infrastructure, Yellow Network promises to transform digital asset swaps between crypto exchanges by providing the rapid cross-chain interoperability they need to transact in real-time. 
The network operates independently of the underlying blockchains, enabling them to scale to an infinite degree. In this way, Yellow can potentially process millions or even billions of individual transactions every hour of every day, for any blockchain platform. It has created the infrastructure that’s required to make high-frequency cross-chain trading a reality for every exchange, and with that, crypto finally has the ability to reach mainstream adoption.

Many of these Layer-2 scaling solutions work great for individual users and decentralized applications, but they can be complex to implement in the crypto trading world, where numerous exchange platforms require a way to process high volume transactions with one another at near instantaneous speeds. 
To solve the problem of cross-chain asset swapping between exchanges, a more advanced solution is required and for that, we can turn to the Layer-3 network Yellow. 
Yellow has created a cross-chain and peer-to-peer network overlay that can facilitate transactions between numerous parties at once by pooling available liquidity from many different networks and participants. It acts as a kind of clearing house for centralized and decentralized exchanges to trade with one another off-chain using state channels. 
The constituents of Yellow’s architecture include a Financial Information Exchange, which serves as a relay network that enables CEXs, DEXs and other brokers to send messages that facilitate individual transactions between one another. The Electronic Communication Network optimizes buy and sell order matching for these participants, while state channels are opened to facilitate the rapid off-chain exchange of assets. When opening a state channel, each participant must deposit collateral within its governing smart contract to cover the balance of all of the traders they plan to make.
Yellow provides a way for numerous parties to engage in high volume trading with immediate finality, with its state channels aiding scalability by only settling the final “state”, or balance at the end of a string of transactions, on the blockchain when it’s closed. Using state channels, governed by Yellow’s architecture, exchanges can essentially perform an unlimited number of cross-chain asset swaps without overwhelming the underlying blockchains. Because the final transaction is recorded onto the blockchain, the system remains as secure as the blockchain itself. 
Within a state channel, each individual transaction is signed by both parties and settled immediately, off-chain, with a smart contract keeping a track of the balance. To close a channel, all participants are required to sign the final transaction before the sum of all of those transactions is verified by the blockchain. 
The beauty of state channels is that each message contains something known as a “nonce”, which can be thought of as a timestamp. Using the nonces, the smart contract can understand the chronological order in which each message, signed by all counterparties, was sent. The smart contract will always settle the state based on the final message that’s signed by all participants within the channel. This prevents foul play, such as one party attempting to close the state channel with an earlier message that doesn’t reflect the true balance of all of the transactions. 
By utilizing state channels as a Layer-3 infrastructure, Yellow Network promises to transform digital asset swaps between crypto exchanges by providing the rapid cross-chain interoperability they need to transact in real-time. 
The network operates independently of the underlying blockchains, enabling them to scale to an infinite degree. In this way, Yellow can potentially process millions or even billions of individual transactions every hour of every day, for any blockchain platform. It has created the infrastructure that’s required to make high-frequency cross-chain trading a reality for every exchange, and with that, crypto finally has the ability to reach mainstream adoption.

False News of SEC’s Approval of BlackRock’s iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF Triggers Plunge in Bitcoin from $30K High;"The post False News of SEC’s Approval of BlackRock’s iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF Triggers Plunge in Bitcoin from $30K High appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to officially approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, but rumors circulating on platform X have led to widespread speculation that the regulatory body has recently approved iShares by BlackRock’s pioneering Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This unconfirmed development, linked to the eagerly awaited financial behemoth’s spot BTC ETF, initially sent Bitcoin’s price soaring towards $30K. However, the momentum was short-lived as the value dropped to around $28K, instigating a wave of uncertain fluctuations in the market.
Everyone knew that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would have a hard time turning down a financial giant like BlackRock when it came to their proposed spot Bitcoin ETF. Recent rumors on X suggest that a history was going to be created as SEC reportedly approved a Bitcoin spot ETF from iShares, BlackRock’s division dedicated to exchange-traded funds.  
Confirmations from both the SEC and Nasdaq’s official channels have shown no evidence supporting these claims. Adding a definitive voice to the matter, BlackRock itself issued a statement clarifying that the news was inaccurate and said that the “ETF IS STILL UNDER REVIEW BY SEC.!”
This scenario underscores the volatility and sensitivity within the market to news, particularly news concerning ETF advancements. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, pinpointed Cointelegraph as the initial source of the false report. 
The news quickly gained traction and was further propagated by coverage from Reuters, among other outlets. This series of events led to a significant, albeit misguided, market reaction, sending Bitcoin’s price to surge towards the $30K threshold in a short period.
Recent speculation about the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, highlighted in a Cointelegraph report, has catalyzed a dramatic market response, sending Bitcoin to peaks of $30K within the last hour.
This unexpected upswing has triggered a spike in liquidations, totaling nearly $100 million. Notably, a substantial portion of these, estimated above $70 million, consisted of short positions. The data implies that the suddenness of the ETF news surprised numerous traders, prompting a swift market realignment and a consequent squeeze on short positions.
In June, BlackRock’s iShares division, a behemoth in fund management, submitted documents to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposing the establishment of a Bitcoin spot ETF. The proposed entity, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, plans to primarily hold bitcoin through a custodian representing the Trust, as detailed in the submission. The documents designate the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase as the expected custodian.

Best Cryptocurrencies to Buy Before the Crypto Bull Cycle Begins;"The next crypto bull cycle is predicted to begin toward the end of October. The signs of it have already begun to show. But it won’t be a wise decision to wait until then to buy the tokens. The bear market provides an excellent opportunity to buy the dip. 
Listed below are three cryptocurrencies that have the highest growth potential this year due to their market relevance and hype. 
Bitcoin Minetrix, as the name implies, is an altcoin inspired by Bitcoin. Its tokenomics bears many similarities to Bitcoin. But it doesn’t limit its scope to just that. 
Instead, Bitcoin Minetrix stands on its own right by putting forward what is probably one of the most creative Web3 use cases of 2023. The project allows anyone to enter the bitcoin mining market and profit from it with absolutely no technical skills. 
The possibility is opened up through blockchain tokenization of Bitcoin mining enabled by $BTCMTX tokens. This is how it works:
Buy $BTCMTX tokens
Stake them in the native stake-to-mine contract
Earn non-tradeable mining credits in exchange
Burn them
Earn BTC mining rewards. 
 
The mining credits are designed to be non-tradeable, thus eliminating the chances of hacks and thefts that are not unheard of in the crypto market. The system safeguards investments within the ecosystem. Unless you plan to sell $BTCMTX tokens, it is best to stake them in exchange for mining credits, as a result. It is a safer method, yes. But more importantly, it continues to earn you rewards during the holding period. 
Although mining has long been inaccessible to average investors, Bitcoin Minetrix has put forward an efficient strategy to tackle that. And therein lies its high growth potential. Anybody can choose the platform to grow their wealth through one of the most lucrative investment opportunities in the crypto market now. 
BUY $BTCMTX TOKENS FOR PRESALE PRICE 
Although Bitcoin has less room for growth and thus lackluster perspectives when compared to Bitcoin Minetrix, it is a good investment. With BTC selling under $30K now, it presents an excellent ‘buy-the-dip’ opportunity. 
The upcoming bitcoin-halving will be the next game-changer in the crypto market that will set it in a new direction. The important milestone has the potential to take the token up to $100K next year. To realize a steep surge like that, the series of bull run have to begin sometime this year. 
Analysts predict that BTC will cross the $30K market in October and reach as high as $50K by the end of December. 
Meme Kombat is the latest craze in the meme coin market, which is known for its explosive pumps. According to market analysts, Meme Kombat is next in line for a strong price action. The token is predicted to climb 10X to 20X up the charts once it goes live. 
To begin with, Meme Kombat is not the typical meme coin that solely relies on its theme. Instead, it is a play-to-earn cryptocurrency that enables investors to gamble on AI-generated battles between their favorite meme characters.
Since the launch a few days back, the presale has raised over $530K with a high 112% staking APY. Presale investors can begin to stake their tokens from the presale stage itself, thus giving them a strong competitive edge against late-comers. 
The play-to-earn utility of Meme Kombat explains the massive rush of traffic to the presale in the last few days. The bear market has urged investors to look for more robust projects that can weather the volatile market movements. Utility-rich projects like Meme Kombat have their attention, as a result. 
Staking is not the only source of income on Meme Kombat. There is a more interesting way users can monetize the platform. For example, they can gamble on meme battles and earn rewards in $MK. The mechanism underpins the sustainable, long-term demand for the token, giving it the capability to beat broader market downtrends. 
A large share of the tokens will be in the staking contract, away from the reach of market participants. The scarcity is further expected to support price action. Once the token is listed on crypto exchanges, analysts are anticipating a huge surge in the price of $MK tokens.
The logically designed tokenomics is another factor that plays to the advantage of the project. 
The play-to-earn meme coin has the potential to make its way toward the top 3 meme coins list in the first half of 2023. The first two seasons of Meme Kombat will go live this year, potentially drawing significant attention to the project and demand for the token.

Roblox calls XRP crypto payments support “inaccurate”;"The crypto world is an ever-evolving space that has faced various events leading to the development of blockchain technology. However, news reports have always affected the digital market, and the latest report by Roblox has concluded on the XRP token support claims in the platform. 
Roblox is not adding Ripple’s XRP token despite the rumors rapidly spreading claims of listing the digital currency. The famous online gaming platform debunked these claims, denying the online rumors. 
The current reports are among the many instances where inaccurate reports have saturated the market and caused significant market shifts. This is  because crypto coins are majorly affected by news, among other factors
Following the circulating claims on Tuesday of Roblox supporting XRP payments, the gaming platform has denied such intentions. Roblox responded to this through its website and social media handles, issuing a statement that concluded the rumors as fake news. 
The platform added that purchasing Robux and paying in-game purchases with Ripple’s XRP token is “inaccurate.” They further stated that payment using other cryptocurrencies is not at all possible. Roblox explained that its design isn’t meant to support crypto transactions, and claims suggesting otherwise are false. 
These rumors started on Monday when BitPay posted a tweet on X confirming the use of XRP in Xsolla payments for its games. They tagged other gaming platforms, including Smite and Roblox. This ignited the rumors that spread like wildfire across the crypto world. 
BitPay posted stating, “Xsolla now accepts XRP with BitPay as a payment method for their games such as Smite and Roblox.” The now-deleted post also confirmed, “You can use your favorite cryptocurrency to buy, play, and enjoy gaming like never before.” 
Bill Zielke, BitPay’s CMO, responded to why the tweet was deleted and was quoted, 
There was an error in the tweet. We will have more tweets about merchants accepting crypto in the near future. Stay tuned.
Regardless of the post being removed indefinitely, the claims spread over the digital space and among the gaming community. Among the tweets confirming BitPay’s new developments was Scott Melker, X’s name tag, The Wolf Of Wall Street, which has gained over 300,000 views. 
His tweet only suggested the potential of integrating XRP into Roblox’s payment methods and the implications such a move could make on the gaming platform. He reflected on the already confirmed move by Xsolla and BitPay. Among the favorable signals he stated were the suitable climate for less legal claims. 
However, Roblox confirmed that teaming up with BitPay in supporting XRP to its gamers was untrue. The various reasons why Roblox declined to support XRP include its gamer audience, which includes minors. 
They could be exposed to a whole new world of complexities that might be harmful to the demographic. Secondly, regulatory uncertainty could compromise the network based on the unforeseen legal challenges that might follow if linked with XRP. 
Moreover, compliance with Apple Store policies that are strict on crypto-related applications. Violation of these policies could mean the delisting of the gaming app on the app stores. 
Additionally, Roblox focuses on its digital currency, Robux, which allows users to place purchases within the gaming platform. This gives them control over their in-game economy.
It is not the first instance when false reports have spread like smoke in the wind, even after confirmation of inaccuracy. Another recent event was when Cointelegraph posted an inaccurate report stating claims of the SEC supporting BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this week. This caused a sudden spike in Bitcoin’s market price, displaying how the crypto market is easily influenced by news.

Coinbase Removes 80 Trading Pairs: Details;"Coinbase announced the delisting of several trading pairs starting today in a bid to enhance overall market health and consolidate liquidity.
The leading crypto exchange said the latest decision comes after regularly monitoring the markets on its platform.
According to an announcement on October 17th, Coinbase said it had suspended trading on 80 non-USD pairs for certain supported assets across Coinbase Exchange, Advanced Trade, and Coinbase Prime.
The pairs also include those featuring cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), as well as stablecoins like Tether (USDT), besides traditional fiat currencies like the Euro.
Some of the trading pairs in question are ACH-USDT, AGLD-USDT, ARPA-EUR, ARPA-USDT, AUCTION-EUR, AUCTION-USDT, BADGER-EUR, BADGER-USDT, BAND-BTC, BAND-EUR, BAND-GBP, BNT-BTC, BNT-EUR, BTRST-BTC, BTRST-EUR, BTRST-USDT, C98-USDT, CTSI-BTC, DESO-USDT, ELA-USDT, ERN-USDT, among others.
Coinbase’s recent removal of trading pairs is consistent with its previously announced plan to suspend certain markets in early October. The platform further stressed that users can continue trading these markets within its “more liquid USD order books” using their USDC balances.
“Please note these markets make up an immaterial amount of Coinbase Exchange’s total trading volume.”
In mid-September, the exchange eliminated 41 non-USD market pairs, attributing the decision to the same factors. Notably, among the suspended markets, none featured USDC, the stablecoin collaboratively developed by Coinbase and Circle, despite the removal of several trading pairs containing USDT.
Despite removing several trading pairs, the exchange relisted XRP after Ripple’s partial win against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Mounting regulatory actions against rival Binance may have helped Coinbase to increase its market share, but its declining trading volume is a cause of concern.
Coinbase’s spot trading volume has recorded a 52% fall in spot trading for the third quarter of 2023. This represents the lowest recorded figure since well before the company’s high-profile direct listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market in April 2021, which took place just months before the market reached its peak prices.

Crypto Tycoon Mike Novogratz Is Confident Spot Bitcoin ETFs Will Be Approved This Year;"
Despite recent false reports that rocked the cryptosphere, the hype surrounding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not faded.
Adding to the excitement, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has expressed strong confidence in the looming approval of spot market ETFs in the United States.
According to Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz, the possibility of having a spot Bitcoin ETF listed on the U.S. market by year’s end is now a near certainty.
Novogratz is convinced that a spot Bitcoin ETF will see approval by the end of this year. “It’s gonna get approved. We think it happens this year, in 2023,” he said during a Wednesday appearance on CNBC. “Talking to all the other people, it just feels like the dialogue with the SEC is all heading in the right direction.”
The billionaire investor points to the fact that the SEC was recently excoriated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for its biased decision in denying Grayscale’s spot product while greenlighting materially similar futures-based ETFs. According to him, the SEC is now under a “tremendous amount of pressure” to approve the product after the court loss.
Novogratz also cited the increasing public demand for a regulated spot-based crypto ETF, stressing BlackRock’s strong support of Bitcoin and its plans to list such an investment product.
The Galaxy Digital CEO also pointed to the notable shift in tone from the Securities and Exchange Commission. He mentions public filings and comment periods as signs of more constructive discussions with potential ETF providers.
“When you go to the comment period and what they’re asking about, [it] all seems much more specific than general,” Novogratz posited.
Market analysts now expect the SEC to go ahead and give the green light to the long list of ETF filings pending review. For Bitcoin optimists, an SEC approval would legitimize not only the alpha crypto but the entire crypto industry. 
If a spot ETF is approved in 2023, as Novogratz predicts, his investment firm, which has teamed up with Invesco on a spot bitcoin ETF application, would certainly benefit.

Despite recent false reports that rocked the cryptosphere, the hype surrounding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not faded.
Adding to the excitement, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has expressed strong confidence in the looming approval of spot market ETFs in the United States.
According to Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz, the possibility of having a spot Bitcoin ETF listed on the U.S. market by year’s end is now a near certainty.
Novogratz is convinced that a spot Bitcoin ETF will see approval by the end of this year. “It’s gonna get approved. We think it happens this year, in 2023,” he said during a Wednesday appearance on CNBC. “Talking to all the other people, it just feels like the dialogue with the SEC is all heading in the right direction.”
The billionaire investor points to the fact that the SEC was recently excoriated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for its biased decision in denying Grayscale’s spot product while greenlighting materially similar futures-based ETFs. According to him, the SEC is now under a “tremendous amount of pressure” to approve the product after the court loss.
Novogratz also cited the increasing public demand for a regulated spot-based crypto ETF, stressing BlackRock’s strong support of Bitcoin and its plans to list such an investment product.

Analyst: Bitcoin Is Closer To $1 Million Than You Think;"Going by the events of October 16, when Bitcoin (BTC) prices temporarily spiked to over $30,000 before retracing on news that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had falsely approved the first Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), it is highly likely that the coin may rally to over $1 million with the total crypto market cap rising to over $15 trillion. 
This outlook is per the estimation of Alessandro Ottaviani, who took to X, predicting how BTC and crypto would look in the next few years once the stringent SEC approves the complex derivative.
Ottaviani, who claims to be versed in Austrian economics, said the total market cap of Bitcoin swelled by over $50 billion on October 16 following the fake news. At this ratio, the analyst estimates that roughly $500 million of capital flew to Bitcoin, assuming a ratio of 100:1. 
Suppose the same ratio is maintained, based on other estimates by Steven Schoenfield, the former managing director at BlackRock, who predicts that BTC could potentially receive between $150 billion and $200 billion within the next three years. 
The total market capitalization will probably exceed $15 trillion in that case. Bitcoin prices will expand to over $1 million at this valuation, nearly 40X from current spot rates.
Looking at BTC charts, prices remain firm and edging higher, buoyed by October 16’s spike. Even though there was a retracement from the over $30,000 registered at peaks, prices are stable and above yesterday’s close. 
From a technical perspective, the expansion of prices on October 16 represented a bullish breakout. As it is, prices are trending above September highs and at around October 2023 levels. 
Whether buyers will maintain the upside momentum, driving prices towards crucial resistance levels at $30,000 and $32,000 in the near term, is yet to be seen. Looking at candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, swing traders may consider prices to retest October 16 highs as the first target. Further trend continuation could lift BTC to July 2023 highs at $32,000, potentially opening up more opportunities for gains above $35,000.
Possible triggers for this upswing are diverse. Many market analysts are bullish that approving a spot Bitcoin ETF could trigger demand. 
Institutions would have a means of gaining exposure to Bitcoin in a regulated manner. Accordingly, as Schoenfield puts it, this will “double or triple the amount of [assets under management] in current Bitcoin products.”

Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Price to Hit $10K in Just One Year? FIND OUT NOW…;"After strong increases in the last few days, the Ethereum price suffered losses again and continues to lag well behind the price movement of Bitcoin. This is causing sentiment among Ethereum investors to plummet. But there is still massive growth potential. Can Bitcoin Halving Trigger an Altcoin Bull Run? Will we see an Ethereum price of $10,000 in 12 months? Let’s take a look at Ethereum price prediction in more detail.
Overall, the Ethereum price has suffered losses in the last few weeks. The price saw a drop from $1,850 to below $1,600 over the last 4 to 5 weeks. This means that the Ether token has lost between 10 and 15 percent of its value during this time. 
Two weeks ago there was a brief rise in the Ethereum price to over $1,700. But this spike was only visible for a short time and in the last 2 weeks the ETH price has fallen back below the $1,600 mark. In the last few days we have seen a slight upward trend again. 
At the moment, the altcoin market is in a massive crisis. The smaller projects such as Solana, Cardano, Polygon or the Memecoins have already seen massive losses in the summer. Ethereum was initially able to hold up better, but has lost heavily against Bitcoin, especially in the last 2 to 3 months. Can this trend be reversed?
The Ethereum price could see a recovery again in the coming months. We must not forget that the altcoins have always suffered extremely in bear markets and the Bitcoin price has been able to hold up better.
The Bitcoin Halving could not only bring about a turning point for BTC, but also bring new hype around altcoins. So far this has always been the case in previous cycles. That’s why we are very positive that the Ethereum price should rise massively again, especially after the Bitcoin Halving. 
The Ethereum price could rise significantly again in the coming months. But is an increase to $10,000 realistic? Actually, this mark was supposed to fall in the last bull market. At the moment we are again massively underestimating the growth potential of Ethereum, precisely because it is the basis of most of the important altcoins.
A rise to $10,000 in 12 months is an extremely optimistic forecast. But we shouldn’t be surprised if the Ethereum price sees a massive increase again in the coming months. 
Purchasing cryptocurrencies can seem daunting for newcomers, but platforms like Bitpanda have made the process straightforward and user-friendly. Bitpanda is a reputable exchange known for its ease of use and security features. To buy cryptos on Bitpanda, simply follow these steps:

Bitcoin Bulls Quietly Accumulate BTC Despite Market Turbulence;"
In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has always emerged as the undisputed leader. Despite the significant drop in Bitcoin’s value, with prices hitting as low as $25,000 last quarter, influential players have continued to accumulate the digital asset. Large Bitcoin holders have been quietly expressing their bullish sentiment in the market.
Data from Santiment reveals that wallets holding at least 0.1% of Bitcoin’s total supply experienced a single-day inflow of $600 million. Moreover, data from IntoTheBlock revealed that three more spikes of $400 million or more followed. Interestingly, these spikes occurred when exchanges saw outflows, indicating that these acquisitions were driven by organic buyers rather than speculative trading on exchanges.
The mid to large-sized wallets have been particularly active in accumulating Bitcoin, adding an impressive 71,155 BTC (equivalent to $1.95 billion) in just the past six weeks. This brings their combined holdings to approximately 90,000 BTC, which is only 0.59% away from their peak of 15.29 million held in November 2021.
The magnitude of these acquisitions is worth noting. With nearly $2 billion worth of Bitcoin added to their portfolios in such a short period, it is clear that these players are not just testing the waters but clearly diving into the market with confidence.
This trend of funds flowing into mid to large-sized wallets also signals a shift in the investment landscape surrounding Bitcoin. While retail investors have long been active participants in the cryptocurrency market, the growing interest from institutional investors is a clear indication that Bitcoin is gaining recognition as a legitimate asset class.
Institutional investors, known for their cautious approach to new and emerging markets, are increasingly recognizing the value of Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Their participation not only adds credibility to Bitcoin but also contributes to its overall market stability.
Looking ahead to the next quarter, it will be fascinating to observe the actions of these mid to large-sized Bitcoin holders. Will they continue their aggressive accumulation strategy, or will they adjust their approach based on market conditions? Only time will tell.
One thing is certain, however: these influential players have unwavering faith in the future value appreciation of Bitcoin. Their relentless accumulation amidst market turbulence speaks volumes about their confidence in the digital asset’s long-term prospects.

Tesla maintains Bitcoin holdings while directing resources toward AI;"Tesla published its Q3 2023 shareholder deck on Oct. 18, indicating that it continues to hold its Bitcoin balance as it directs resources to AI efforts.
The company reported $184 million in digital assets, known to be composed largely or entirely of Bitcoin (BTC), for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2023.
That amount is equal to Tesla’s holdings for the three previous quarters but represents a long-term decrease due to earlier sales and price changes. Tesla originally purchased $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021, an amount that once surpassed $2 billion in value. However, the company sold most of its Bitcoin in 2022, causing it to report just $218 million in digital assets for the quarters ending June 30, 2022, and Sept. 30, 2022.
In the same shareholder deck, Tesla detailed its objectives concerning its vehicle and energy businesses and, significantly, its artificial intelligence endeavors. It said:
“We have more than doubled the size of our AI training compute to accommodate for our growing dataset as well as our Optimus robot project. Our humanoid robot is currently being trained for simple tasks through AI rather than hard-coded software, and its hardware is being further upgraded in order to handle datasets.”
In terms of general earnings, the company reported $23.4 billion in revenue, down approximately 6% from $24.9 billion in Q2 2023. On both occasions, the company’s automotive business accounted for the vast majority of overall revenue.
Several investors have again submitted several crypto-related questions, including one on whether Tesla would add Bitcoin payments for its charging network and another asking if Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer would make use of Bitcoin.
Several people asked whether the company plans to once again Bitcoin and crypto payments in general. This is in line with Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s earlier promise to accept Bitcoin once the mining industry is 50% reliant on renewable energy.
Tesla’s shareholder call was ongoing at press time.

Lightning Labs Rolls Out Taproot Assets Mainnet Alpha;"Bitcoin-focused company Lightning Labs has launched the Taproot Assets mainnet alpha daemon.
Simply put, Taproot Assets uses Bitcoin's technology to handle, create, and delve into stablecoins and other assets. Think of it as a modern financial tool, backed by Bitcoin's known security and decentralized features. The current version, Taproot Assets v0.3, enables developers to transform Bitcoin into a network that can support various assets, all while maintaining its foundational principles.
The main aim here is to evolve Bitcoin. It's not just about it being a cryptocurrency anymore. It's about making it a global network for digital money transactions. By merging Taproot Assets with Lightning transactions, the way we understand financial exchanges might undergo a significant shift, making them more in tune with Bitcoin's built-in liquidity.
From its white paper release last year to now, the journey has been a combined effort. Inputs from the Bitcoin developer world, lessons from the testnet phase, and the support from early users have all played a part in shaping Taproot Assets. During its test phase, close to 2,000 assets were created, with nodes connecting to the 'Universe server' (a key source for Taproot Asset data for wallets) more than 420,000 times.
For those interested, Taproot Assets daemon is available in the recent versions of Polar and litd v0.12, packed with tools from basic node operations to support for multiple assets. It's important to note, however, that even with its potential, it's in its early stages. Continued community feedback and testing for any possible risks is vital.
Looking back, Bitcoin's significant step into mainstream finance came when El Salvador recognized it as official currency in 2021. After that, the Lightning Network saw remarkable growth, particularly in developing regions. The rising demand for stablecoins globally played a crucial role. Considering their digital nature, stablecoins can often be more appealing than local currencies in areas with high inflation. For the roughly 2 billion people facing steep inflation in their local currencies, the consistent value of stablecoins, usually tied to the dollar, is attractive.
There's also a growing interest in incorporating real assets like gold, company bonds, and US government bonds into the Bitcoin sphere. Many believe that with Bitcoin's vast reach, decentralized system, and strong security, these assets can be more accessible to the general public.
The Taproot Assets v0.3 update invites developers to explore mainnet assets further. With user-friendly APIs for creating and redeeming assets and support for tranched issuance, the process is streamlined. There are also features to ensure physical assets linked to these digital ones can be safely retrieved.
For transactions on the Taproot Assets chain, a new asynchronous receive function means assets can be sent or received anytime, even if both parties aren't online at the same time. This update also introduces 'Multiverse Mode', giving developers a thorough tool for block exploration for users.
This version also sees improvements in security, scalability, and user experience. Additions like Schnorr signatures, PSBTs, and witness fields make it even more robust.
This is just a starting point. The team behind Taproot Assets aims to make Lightning a network that supports multiple assets. The prospect of transferring any currency over the Lightning Network, using Bitcoin's extensive liquidity, is now within reach.

$65 Million in Bitcoin Positions Liquidated After False Reports of BlackRock ETF Approval;"In a dramatic twist for cryptocurrency traders, false reports circulated today that BlackRock ETF had received approval, leading to a swift liquidation of Bitcoin positions valued at approximately $65 million.
The cryptocurrency market witnessed a whirlwind of activity recently when Cointelegraph erroneously reported that the SEC had approved the BlackRock ETF. This misinformation led to a buying frenzy, catapulting Bitcoin’s price to a staggering $30k. However, this surge was short-lived. Within minutes, the price retraced to its pre-surge levels, starkly highlighting the volatile nature of the crypto market. Many market observers are pointing to this incident as a classic case of market manipulation, underscoring the need for traders to approach news and sudden market movements with caution.
This underscores the dangers of relying on unverified information in a market as volatile as cryptocurrency. The speed at which this false news spread only amplified its impact, with many traders making swift decisions based on the erroneous belief that a significant market development had taken place.
Within minutes of the fake news breaking, the cryptocurrency market responded with sharp price fluctuations. Many traders, assuming the false information to be accurate, acted rapidly, leading to a massive liquidation of positions. This kind of volatile reaction highlights the fragility of the cryptocurrency market, which is often driven by news and sentiment.
BlackRock, one of the world’s leading investment firms, was quick to refute the rumors. In a statement, the firm clarified, “We have not received any approval for an iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF. We urge market participants to rely only on official statements and to exercise caution with unofficial sources.”
Today’s incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of reliable and accurate information, especially in a space as fast-paced as cryptocurrency. Investors are urged to verify any news or announcements with official sources before making any trading decisions.
The recent fake approval incident surrounding the Bitcoin Spot ETF has raised several pressing concerns about the fragility and integrity of crypto-related news dissemination.

In a dramatic twist for cryptocurrency traders, false reports circulated today that BlackRock ETF had received approval, leading to a swift liquidation of Bitcoin positions valued at approximately $65 million.
The cryptocurrency market witnessed a whirlwind of activity recently when Cointelegraph erroneously reported that the SEC had approved the BlackRock ETF. This misinformation led to a buying frenzy, catapulting Bitcoin’s price to a staggering $30k. However, this surge was short-lived. Within minutes, the price retraced to its pre-surge levels, starkly highlighting the volatile nature of the crypto market. Many market observers are pointing to this incident as a classic case of market manipulation, underscoring the need for traders to approach news and sudden market movements with caution.
This underscores the dangers of relying on unverified information in a market as volatile as cryptocurrency. The speed at which this false news spread only amplified its impact, with many traders making swift decisions based on the erroneous belief that a significant market development had taken place.
Within minutes of the fake news breaking, the cryptocurrency market responded with sharp price fluctuations. Many traders, assuming the false information to be accurate, acted rapidly, leading to a massive liquidation of positions. This kind of volatile reaction highlights the fragility of the cryptocurrency market, which is often driven by news and sentiment.
BlackRock, one of the world’s leading investment firms, was quick to refute the rumors. In a statement, the firm clarified, “We have not received any approval for an iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF. We urge market participants to rely only on official statements and to exercise caution with unofficial sources.”

This Could Trigger Next Dogecoin Bull Run, Analyst Says;"An analyst has explained using a pattern that Dogecoin could be off on its next bull run if a certain level can be reclaimed.
In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed where DOGE could head next from here. Sharing the below chart, the analyst notes, “Dogecoin is approaching the apex of this multi-year descending triangle formation.”

A “descending triangle” pattern is a popular tool used in technical analysis created using two lines. The first line, the upper level, is drawn by connecting consecutive local tops, each lower than the last. The other line, the horizontal level, is made by joining bottoms.
This triangle is often used as a bearish predictor, as the price moves in an overall downward trajectory inside the triangle. A break below the lower level can signify that the bearish downtrend is here to stay for the asset.
However, a breakout above the upper level is generally a bullish sign, with the wider trend observing a reversal. From the chart, it’s visible that Dogecoin has been unable to find any break above this descending triangle pattern that has been stuck inside for more than two years.
The asset has continued to find resistance at the upper level, but the coin hasn’t retested the lower bound for a while now. The memecoin is continuing to stay close to the upper trendline.
As the analyst has mentioned, the asset is now close to the triangle’s end. “A weekly candlestick close above $0.0835 could trigger the beginning of a new DOGE bull run, potentially toward $1,” explains Ali.
Such a rally to $1 from this level would imply returns of almost 1100%, while from the price that DOGE currently trades at, it would be a whopping 1566% jump.
However, the analyst also tells traders to be cautious about the 0.04817 support level, as “any sign of weakness around this level could lead to a new yearly low.”
It remains to be seen how the Dogecoin price will develop shortly, especially given that it’s now fast closing towards the end of the triangle.
Earlier today, false news broke out that the iShares Bitcoin spot ETF was approved by the US SEC, and the cryptocurrency market responded with a sharp rally. As traders realized that the rumor was baseless, the assets all retraced back to the levels they were at before the surge.
The graph below shows that Dogecoin is trading around $0.06 again, having fully retraced the sudden rally.

Bitcoin Is Physical: Bits And Bytes Have To Live Somewhere;"Sound money is money that is not prone to sudden debasement. The conversation surrounding sound money has reached a critical point, given the present uncertainties in the global financial landscape. 
The spiraling debt of sovereign nations have heightened concerns about currency debasement. In contrast to fiat, which can be created out of thin air, sound money is linked to tangibility: it is something you can touch, weigh, and stow away. There's a growing chorus of people convinced that gold is the sole antidote to the hyperinflationary threat to fiat money. 
The question of whether Bitcoin is sound money has long provoked debates among economists, investors, and financial pundits. Bitcoin, being an intangible digital asset, is often dismissed by sound money advocates because it doesn't offer the same physical assurances that gold does. You can’t hold bitcoin in your hand, so how could it be sound money? 
Advocates for Bitcoin as sound money often respond that, although bitcoin is not physical, it is “backed by mathematics.” But this misses the mark. Although it is true, this argument often fails to persuade the skeptics because mathematics lack a physical basis.
In fact, Bitcoin is literally physical, just like gold is. Being able to explain this to sound money advocates who are Bitcoin skeptics is a key challenge for Bitcoin educators today. Let’s explore some of the ways Bitcoin is physical so that we might make a stronger case to gold enthusiasts as to why Bitcoin is sound money.
To explain the ways in which Bitcoin is physical, we need to delve into technical territory, starting with how flash memory works. 
Flash memory, a type of non-volatile storage medium for data, is the most common way that the Bitcoin ledger is recorded in each Bitcoin node. Flash memory is “non-volatile,” which means that the data stored inside it will remain intact, even without a supply of electricity. 
At the microscopic level, flash memory is made up of an array of memory cells, each constructed from a MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor). These transistors are tiny switches that have a floating gate that traps or releases electrons. The presence or absence of electrons on this floating gate translates into binary code, which in turn represents data. 
When you hold Bitcoin, your ownership record is literally a configuration of physical gates in a MOSFET inside a flash memory chip. Every Bitcoin transaction that ever happened is recorded in the physical states of transistors inside Bitcoin nodes scattered around the globe.
Now, flash memory might not weigh as much as a gold bar, but it is undeniably physical. With a powerful microscope, you could even take a look and see the states of those gates inside flash memory chips with your own eyes.
Let’s turn to private keys, which are alphanumeric codes that grant control over some amount of Bitcoin. Whether etched onto a metal plate or stored in a secure chip, your private key is as physically real as a chunk of gold.
If you store your private key in the form of a seed phrase that is either written on paper or etched into metal plates, as many do, then its physicality is obvious. However, while it may be tempting to assume that a seed phrase stored in this way is just a physical representation of something that is non-physical, that’s not quite right. 
Hardware wallets are widely considered the best way for individuals to ensure security of their private keys. A hardware wallet typically contains a secure element, a chip that securely stores a private key. The secure element heightens security because it is designed to withstand attempts at physical tampering and unauthorized access. 
The secure element inside a hardware wallet does indeed store a private key physically in flash memory in the form of electrical states of transistors. Remember, each transistor is a switch with states that can either be on or off. The private key, therefore, is a specific sequence of these states. 
Even the private key stored in a hot wallet on a phone must exist physically in the phone’s non-volatile memory.
One of the arguments that people who believe gold to be a superior form of sound money to Bitcoin is that Bitcoin relies on electricity and computers. They argue that, if a civilizational collapse were to occur that would disrupt electricity for an extended period of time, or even permanently, then Bitcoin would be useless. However, this view is mistaken. Bitcoin’s physicality allows it to survive almost any catastrophe. A famous moment from Hollywood will help illustrate the point.
The 1999 movie Fight Club famously ends with the destruction of all consumer debt. In the final scene, we watch the anti-heroes look out the windows of a skyscraper, gazing upon collapsing buildings. We are told that these buildings contained all records of consumer debt. With the buildings destroyed, the debt is wiped out, and “financial equilibrium” is restored.
Although it makes for a thought provoking ending, audiences watching the movie had trouble suspending disbelief in this scene. Are we really supposed to believe that all records of consumer debt are held in a few buildings? Even dozens of buildings? Intuitively, we would assume that there must be copies of these records spread all over the world, in various cities, computers, and files. Even if most of these records were destroyed, although recovery may be slow, copies would eventually be located and the pre-existing state of credit and debt would be restored.
The Bitcoin blockchain is much more robust even than records of consumer debt. The Bitcoin ledger doesn't exist in a single location or even a handful of locations; it's replicated across thousands of nodes worldwide, at almost every imaginable longitude and latitude. Each node holds a physical copy of the ledger in its flash memory, and collectively, all of the Bitcoin nodes serve as an absurdly redundant global backup system. They all talk to each other and confirm that their physical states are identical to each other.
In fact, planet Earth is continuously bathed in the Bitcoin blockchain by satellites that broadcast it 24 hours a day. Even if internet connectivity were disrupted for an extended period in some locations, those locations could stay in sync with the Bitcoin network using an inexpensive radio dish.
In the wake of any catastrophic event that might disrupt infrastructure, one of the primary objectives for recovery would be the restoration of power and communication networks. As history has shown, recovering societies prioritize reestablishing these utilities as a foundation for rebuilding. Once power and internet connectivity are restored, so too is the Bitcoin network. All the physical copies of the ledger, stored in flash memory across decentralized nodes worldwide, and even in space, would be there to ensure the continuity and integrity of the system. 
This decentralization makes it extremely unlikely that any catastrophe — be it an electromagnetic pulse (EMP), nuclear detonation, or even a meteor strike — could wipe out all of the physical copies of the ledger. 
Of course, there is always the possibility of a catastrophe so intense as to trigger a planet-wide extinction-level event. In that case, the human species will have bigger problems to contend with than which form of money to use, and will be no better off with gold than with Bitcoin.
Why is it vital to spread understanding about Bitcoin being physical? 
In an age where financial systems are becoming increasingly abstract and detached from the tangible, people crave the security of something concrete. That's why many resort to gold, real estate, and other physical assets. 
The argument that Bitcoin can't serve as sound money because it lacks the tangibility of gold is a misunderstanding of how Bitcoin technology works. Bitcoin is not an abstract, ephemeral digital construct. It is a form of sound money that has physical existence. 
Understanding Bitcoin’s physicality can remove a significant mental block for many potential users. This would allow them to benefit from including Bitcoin in their own financial arsenal, as well as improving the resilience of the Bitcoin network itself through the introduction of a sizable cohort of committed sound money proponents.

Bitcoin Market Cap Could Rise By $1 Trillion After Spot ETFs Launch: CryptoQuant;"CryptoQuant has revealed in its latest report that the Bitcoin market cap could rise by as much as $1 trillion after launching the spot ETFs.
Yesterday, fake news of the approved iShares Bitcoin spot ETF took the sector by storm, as all cryptocurrencies observed sharp rallies. At the peak of this surge, BTC had approached the $30,000 level.
However, when the market realized the truth about the announcement, the asset quickly retraced to the levels it was at before the rally. While the gains were only brief, the rally nonetheless provided a glimpse into the strong reaction that the market could see to the launch of a real ETF.
This was just one spot ETF; however, several others are waiting in line to be approved. How would the market look like when all these ETFs have launched? In its new report, the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has discussed precisely that.

The above table shows information about the various companies waiting to be approved for the Bitcoin spot ETF, including the total size of their assets under management (AUM).
“Although these ETFs are not expected to be approved this year, the probability that they will be approved by the final deadline (March 2024) has been growing as a result of favorable court rulings for Grayscale (GBTC Fund) and XRP in their respective legal fight against the SEC,” says the firm.
In total, these companies’ AUM are around $15.6 trillion. If they put just 1% of this amount towards BTC, it would mean inflows of a whopping $155 billion for the asset. “To put it in context, these amounts represent almost a third of the current market capitalization of Bitcoin,” notes CryptoQuant.
Now, how this capital inflow could affect the market cap of BTC isn’t exactly simple to say. Generally, the market cap increases by more than just the raw capital entering the cryptocurrency.
The firm has used the “realized cap” metric to assess this relationship. The realized cap is a capitalization method for BTC that calculates its total value by assuming that the value of each coin is the same as the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain.
The realized cap can be imagined as the total investment made by the investors, accounting for the prices at which each bought their coins. The chart below shows how this realized cap has compared with the market over the years.

The graph shows that the market cap and realized cap usually have noticeably different growth rates, as they have always followed pretty different paths.
CryptoQuant has calculated the ratio between the annual growths of the two caps and has found that for most of the asset’s history, the market cap has grown by 3 to 6 times faster than the realized cap.
If the realized cap grows by $155 billion when the spot ETFs get approved and the asset managers allot 1% of their AUM to Bitcoin, the market cap could grow by between $450 and $900 billion.
The report notes this figure implies “the market cap would increase between 82% and 165% from the current level and that Bitcoin price could reach between $50K and $73K as a result of these inflows of fresh money.”
Bitcoin has enjoyed some uptrend over the past few days as the asset has now climbed above the $28,500 level.

In total, these companies’ AUM are around $15.6 trillion. If they put just 1% of this amount towards BTC, it would mean inflows of a whopping $155 billion for the asset. “To put it in context, these amounts represent almost a third of the current market capitalization of Bitcoin,” notes CryptoQuant.
Now, how this capital inflow could affect the market cap of BTC isn’t exactly simple to say. Generally, the market cap increases by more than just the raw capital entering the cryptocurrency.
The firm has used the “realized cap” metric to assess this relationship. The realized cap is a capitalization method for BTC that calculates its total value by assuming that the value of each coin is the same as the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain.
The realized cap can be imagined as the total investment made by the investors, accounting for the prices at which each bought their coins. The chart below shows how this realized cap has compared with the market over the years.

The graph shows that the market cap and realized cap usually have noticeably different growth rates, as they have always followed pretty different paths.
CryptoQuant has calculated the ratio between the annual growths of the two caps and has found that for most of the asset’s history, the market cap has grown by 3 to 6 times faster than the realized cap.
If the realized cap grows by $155 billion when the spot ETFs get approved and the asset managers allot 1% of their AUM to Bitcoin, the market cap could grow by between $450 and $900 billion.
The report notes this figure implies “the market cap would increase between 82% and 165% from the current level and that Bitcoin price could reach between $50K and $73K as a result of these inflows of fresh money.”
Bitcoin has enjoyed some uptrend over the past few days as the asset has now climbed above the $28,500 level.

$200 million in Bitcoin leaves exchanges amid ETF hearsay;"Over the course of Oct. 16, a total of 7,000 Bitcoin, worth roughly $200 million, vacated exchanges. While some movement may be in response to a recent wave of misinformation regarding the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, the flurry of on-chain has persisted both before and after.

This movement was accompanied by a notable contraction in open interest, representing the total funds allocated in open futures contracts. Initially standing at $11 billion, open interest took a hit of over $1 billion, plunging to a little above $10 billion.
The ripple effects didn’t stop there. In the past 24 hours, there has been a liquidation of $183 million in the crypto market, with Bitcoin accounting for over $100 million of this total. More than $80 million of these Bitcoin liquidations were in the form of short liquidations, marking the largest such event since August 17.

Why Bitcoin’s Previous Lows Won’t Repeat, According To This Analyst;"Bitcoin (BTC), the reigning king of cryptocurrencies, is on the cusp of an exciting phase, according to prominent crypto trader Jason Pizzino. 
In his latest YouTube video, Pizzino delves into the intricacies of Bitcoin’s four-year cycle and shares his belief that the digital currency is unlikely to revisit its previous cycle lows. This analysis is based on historical data that reveals a compelling pattern in Bitcoin’s price movements.
One of the key factors driving Pizzino’s outlook is Bitcoin’s four-year cycle, a well-documented phenomenon in the world of cryptocurrency. This cycle refers to the period between each Bitcoin halving event, which occurs approximately every four years. 
During a halving event, the reward for mining new Bitcoins is reduced by half. These events, in turn, have a profound impact on Bitcoin’s supply dynamics and often trigger significant price fluctuations.
“The main thing is it is almost guaranteed that $15,500 is not going to break,” Pizzino explains. “And potentially we won’t see closes under the March low either, which is at $19,500, something that I’ve talked about for a long time on the channel now.” 
This suggests that Bitcoin is poised to maintain its key support levels, marking the end of a bearish phase and the start of a new bull market.
To gain a more comprehensive perspective on Bitcoin’s performance, Pizzino also compares its movements to those of traditional markets, particularly the S&P 500. He highlights that within the four-year cycle, the S&P 500 typically reaches a new all-time high before Bitcoin manages to do the same. 

This pattern, observed during previous accumulation years, demonstrates Bitcoin’s resilience and potential for long-term growth.
In another notable development, the Bitcoin-to-Gold ratio has undergone a substantial transformation over the past two years. In 2021, Bitcoin was valued at 35 times the price of gold, while in 2023, this ratio has halved to 15. This shift in the ratio is a critical indicator of Bitcoin’s performance relative to a traditional store of value like gold.

This shift is significant because it reflects the changing dynamics of the financial landscape. Bitcoin’s decreasing ratio to gold could indicate that investors are becoming more cautious about the cryptocurrency, possibly as a response to regulatory concerns or increased market maturity.
As of the latest available data, Bitcoin’s price, according to CoinGecko, stands at $28,314.26. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin experienced a minor dip of 1.4%, but it has exhibited a gain of 5.4% in the seven-day period. These fluctuations are typical in the world of cryptocurrencies and highlight the asset’s inherent volatility.

Bitcoin holder sentiment split as UTXO data reveals both substantial profits and losses;"The most recent UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) data provides a clear indication of the price points at which the existing Bitcoin UTXOs were created.
The current set of Bitcoin UTXOs, created at varying price points, is effectively demonstrated with each bar representing the quantity of bitcoins last transacted within a specified price bucket.
Following the SVB incident in March, Bitcoin has remained within a trading range of $25,000 to $30,000. This trend is distinctly mirrored by the URPD metric, which reveals that approximately 21.6% of the Bitcoin supply is held within this price range, denoted by an amber color indicative of neither profit nor loss substantiation.
On the brighter side, approximately 35% of the supply, depicted in green, is sitting on meaningful profits. However, this implies a significant portion, just under half the supply, is enduring substantial losses from prices above $30,000.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren joins over 100 U.S. lawmakers urging for swift action on crypto-financed terrorism;"Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and over a hundred lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have raised alarms about the role of cryptocurrency in funding terrorist activities. The group sent a letter to the Biden administration this week, urging immediate action to curb the use of digital currencies for illicit purposes. Moreover, the letter specifically references a report that claims Hamas and other militant groups utilized cryptocurrency for financing attacks in Israel.
Senator Warren has previously introduced a bill aimed at combating money laundering and sanctions evasion through cryptocurrencies. Despite initial hesitation from some colleagues, including Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown, the letter received bipartisan support. Among the crypto-friendly lawmakers who signed the letter were Representative Jake Auchincloss and Josh Gottheimer. These calls for action were not only urgent but timely, as they seek a response from the administration by the end of October.
Coinciding with these political maneuvers, the Treasury Department announced fresh sanctions against a Gaza-based virtual currency exchange. The sanctions also extend to ten Hamas-affiliated groups and various individuals in multiple countries. This action follows a series of seizures conducted by Israel’s National Bureau for Counter-Terrorist Financing, which targeted virtual currency wallets associated with Hamas.
The Treasury Department’s actions were supported by statements from the Crypto Council for Innovation, led by Ji Kim, who emphasized that the U.S. already has stringent anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations in place. Kim also stated that the crypto industry is ready to cooperate with lawmakers to eradicate illicit activity.
The concerns are not just an American issue but extend globally. Reports indicate that between August 2021 and June 2023, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad reportedly raised over $130 million in cryptocurrency. On October 7, a tragic attack in Israel resulted in over 1,200 deaths and nearly 3,000 wounded. Although it has not been confirmed that cryptocurrency directly funded these attacks, Hamas publicly solicited Bitcoin donations for their efforts. 
The lawmakers’ plea to the administration comes as a direct response to this escalating issue. They specifically want to know what steps are being taken to counter the use of digital assets by terrorist organizations and also question accounts held at crypto exchanges like Binance and the use of Tether.
The bipartisan letter to the Biden administration highlights the high level of concern from lawmakers regarding the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit activities. Sent with a request for a formal response by October 31, the letter aims to expedite governmental action. It specifically queries the administration’s current efforts to mitigate the risks posed by the utilization of digital currencies in terrorist financing, drawing attention from both parties and lawmakers who have been both cautious and supportive of cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin Settles Above $28K After the $2K Rollecoaster Induced by the Fake BTC ETF News (Market Watch);"Bitcoin went on a tear yesterday by surging by over $2,000 in minutes but just as quickly lost those gains following the confirmation about fake news in regards to a spot BTC ETF.
The altcoins went through something similar, but most are now sitting with minor losses. SOL, on the other hand, has skyrocketed by 6% daily.
The primary cryptocurrency had a quiet weekend, which it spent in a tight range between $26,500 and $27,000. Despite a few attempts to overcome the latter, the bears kept control over the market and didn’t allow any further increases.
That changed on Monday morning when bitcoin shot up by about a grand and touched $28,000 for the first time in about a week. Although that was an impressive price pump within 24 hours, it was nothing compared to what happened later that day.
Reports emerged that the SEC had finally greenlighted a spot BTC ETF in the States, a move anticipated by numerous industry participants. The news sent shockwaves across the market, and bitcoin exploded by $2,000 in minutes, tapping a two-month peak at just shy of $30,000.
However, the reports were quickly refuted, and the asset fell back down toward $28,000. After a bit more volatility and another minor pump, the cryptocurrency has now retraced to just over $28,000.
Its market capitalization stands inches above $550 billion, while its dominance over the altcoins is well above 50%.
Most altcoins also felt the positive consequences of the fake news briefly but lost almost all gains immediately. As such, the majority of the mid-cap ones are now trading in the red, including Uniswap, MakerDAO, CRO, LINK, LEO, AVAX, DOT, and ADA.
In contrast, ETH, BNB, TRX, and MATIC have minor gains. Solana, on the other hand, has defied the market sentiment and is up by over 6%. As a result, SOL sits at $24.
The total market cap has added another $10 billion overnight and is close to $1.1 trillion. Interestingly, the 24-hour trading volumes soared after the fake news yesterday by more than 140%, according to CMC.

Bitcoin Price To Hit $42K – $56K with BlackRock’s ETF Approval – Matrixport Research Report;"The post Bitcoin Price To Hit $42K – $56K with BlackRock’s ETF Approval – Matrixport Research Report appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The potential approval of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has sent shockwaves through the crypto sphere. Wu Blockchain’s recent X post, citing Matrixport research report, speculates that if the ETF gets the green light, Bitcoin’s price could skyrocket to either $42,000 (a conservative estimate) or even a staggering $56,000 if an influx of $50 billion pours into the market.
 So, what’s driving this optimism? An anticipated mammoth $300 billion surge into the Bitcoin market within the first year of the ETF’s existence. The fact that the U.S. SEC hasn’t raised objections to Grayscale’s success further fuels confidence in Bitcoin Spot ETFs. 
Currently, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $28,333, with a close analysis of the 4-hour chart revealing intriguing patterns. Immediate resistance is $28,652, followed by critical levels at $29,100, $29,520, and $30,600. These indicators align with the research’s bold projections, potentially paving the way for a seismic shift in BTC’s value. Naturally, the question arises: how could Bitcoin climb to $42,000 to $56,000? Let’s see the rationale behind the report. 
Imagine a crypto surge in 2023. That’s what Matrixport’s ‘Matrix onTarget’ report foresees, and it’s got us all excited. This bold forecast is based on factors like lower US inflation and a friendly economic environment. The report doesn’t just predict a comeback for Bitcoin and Ethereum; it says things will get way less bumpy in the crypto world.
The Matrixport research pointed out that if the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is approved, a conservative estimate is that the price of Bitcoin will rise to $42,000; an optimistic estimate is that with an inflow of $50 billion money, Bitcoin may rise to $56,000.  https://t.co/Fr1zL6vHzO
Let’s talk about GBTC (Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Trust), the superstar of this story. It’s had a spectacular 167% growth this year, even outperforming Bitcoin, which increased by 71%. GBTC started the year at a -45% discount in net asset value (NAV), which improved to -43%. But the real game-changer came in June 2023 when Black Rock revealed its ETF application.
Matrixport’s research analyzed a group of 15,000 US registered investor advisors (RIA) handling a massive $5 trillion. These investors have the potential to change the game. Suppose just 1% of them suggest investing in Bitcoin. 
In that case, we’re looking at a whopping $50 billion coming in. Now, imagine this: precious metals ETFs are worth around $120 billion, and if just 10-20% of those investors switch to a Bitcoin ETF for a change, we might see an incredible $12-24 billion flowing into the Bitcoin ETF. That is the power of ETFs; SEC’s recent talk with ETF issuers also adds a bullish picture for Bitcoin enthusiasts. 
So, what if Blackrock’s Bitcoin ETF gets the thumbs up? If Tether’s market cap increases by $24 billion, a hint of what’s to come, Bitcoin could climb to $42,000 – the conservative estimate. With $50 billion flowing in (thanks to a 1% allocation from RIAs), Bitcoin could hit an impressive $56,000. The crypto revolution is knocking on our doors! Are you Excited?

The report doesn’t just predict a comeback for Bitcoin and Ethereum; it says things will get way less bumpy in the crypto world.
The Matrixport research pointed out that if the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is approved, a conservative estimate is that the price of Bitcoin will rise to $42,000; an optimistic estimate is that with an inflow of $50 billion money, Bitcoin may rise to $56,000.  https://t.co/Fr1zL6vHzO
Let’s talk about GBTC (Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Trust), the superstar of this story. It’s had a spectacular 167% growth this year, even outperforming Bitcoin, which increased by 71%. GBTC started the year at a -45% discount in net asset value (NAV), which improved to -43%. But the real game-changer came in June 2023 when Black Rock revealed its ETF application.
Matrixport’s research analyzed a group of 15,000 US registered investor advisors (RIA) handling a massive $5 trillion. These investors have the potential to change the game. Suppose just 1% of them suggest investing in Bitcoin. 
In that case, we’re looking at a whopping $50 billion coming in. Now, imagine this: precious metals ETFs are worth around $120 billion, and if just 10-20% of those investors switch to a Bitcoin ETF for a change, we might see an incredible $12-24 billion flowing into the Bitcoin ETF. That is the power of ETFs; SEC’s recent talk with ETF issuers also adds a bullish picture for Bitcoin enthusiasts. 
So, what if Blackrock’s Bitcoin ETF gets the thumbs up? If Tether’s market cap increases by $24 billion, a hint of what’s to come, Bitcoin could climb to $42,000 – the conservative estimate. With $50 billion flowing in (thanks to a 1% allocation from RIAs), Bitcoin could hit an impressive $56,000. The crypto revolution is knocking on our doors! Are you Excited?

Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out Potential Price Targets for Bitcoin and Ethereum, Updates Outlook on Algorand (ALGO);"SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci is identifying his price targets for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).
In a new interview with Altcoin Daily, Scaramucci says that the king crypto could hit six figures within a year after Bitcoin’s halving event.
“I believe six to 12 months after the halving cycle, there’s no reason why Bitcoin couldn’t be at $100,000. Just given what I know about demand and given what I know about the cycle and where the miners are, and so forth, and plus, we may get some interest rate relief. That’s a 3x bump. That’s happened in the world of technology all over the place, so it certainly could happen to Bitcoin.” 
Bitcoin’s next halving event, when miners’ rewards of cut in half therefore reducing new supply, is expected in April 2024.
Bitcoin is trading for $28,472 at the of writing.
Next, Scaramucci says ETH could soar by more than 185% from its current value in six to 12 months after BTC’s halving event.
“Ethereum, I am not as close to, although we do have a position in it. Could Ethereum be $4,500 by then? Why not? You know it’s a great utility. Speeds have improved. The layer-2s have helped it. Why not? Why couldn’t it be $4,500? These things are maturing.” 
Ethereum is worth $1,576 at time of writing.
Lastly, the trader weighs in on smart contract platform Algorand (ALGO). He predicts it could increase by more than 200% from its current value.
“I’m bullish. I thought at $1 it could have easily gotten to $5. I’ve gotten this wrong. The thing is trading at $0.09 or $0.10… 
But could Algorand from here – because we can only price ourselves today, we can’t go back into the past – could it be a $0.30 token as they continue their development and continue the adoption of what they’re doing and bringing in corporations that love the technology? I believe it can.” 
ALGO is trading for $0.092 at time of writing.

Bitcoin Repeats Patterns Seen in Pre-Halving Years: Analyst;"In a recent YouTube video, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen said the largest cryptocurrency network, Bitcoin, is repeating patterns seen in previous pre-halving years. The analyst pointed to the historic price performance of Bitcoin to drive his point home.
In particular, the analyst mentioned that Bitcoin in pre-halving years trades up in the first half of the year and trends down in the other half. The analyst continued that the only time this didn’t happen was in 2015, when BTC had a lower first half of the year.
According to the analyst, macro conditions now affect crypto prices too, not just pressures within the crypto market. Cowen pointed to the S&P 500 correction, which he said would draw Bitcoin below the market support band.

Bitcoin Whale Addresses See Unprecedented Jump, Is $30,000 Possible?;"Bitcoin’s price performance last week may have disappointed investors, but there are indications of a growing momentum as the new week started. Bitcoin spiked up in the early hours of Monday to almost $28,000 before facing resistance that sent it back down. 
It would seem whales have been making moves to push BTC up, as indicated by the increasing number of whale wallets. New Bitcoin mid-whale addresses, meaning addresses holding between 100-1,000 BTC, saw a huge single-day increase recently, according to data from analytics firm Santiment. 
On-chain data have shown, as was previously reported, that Bitcoin whales are increasing their holdings, with long-term holders adding more than 50,000 BTC to their wallets each month. A similar occurrence took place over the weekend when the number of Bitcoin wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC experienced its largest jump this year. 
An X post by crypto on-chain analytic platform Santiment revealed that this metric grew by 16 more wallets, its largest since February 2022. During the same period, wallets between 10-100 BTC fell, indicating smaller wallets adding to their holdings to proceed to the next tier. 

Whale addresses have increased by 117 BTC in the past 48 hours, worth roughly $3.2 million, as whales look to push price gains. Although on-chain signals currently point to bearish, the continued influx of investors accumulating Bitcoin could signal higher demand and price appreciation for the leading cryptocurrency. 
#Bitcoin whales bought around 117 $BTC in the past 48 hours, worth roughly $3.2 million. pic.twitter.com/Aoshmy0r4D
— Ali (@ali_charts) October 15, 2023
With whales stocking up their wallets, the 24-hour trading volume for Bitcoin climbed by 180.15%, and the price of Bitcoin increased by 3.26%. If the current pace is maintained, there is a significant likelihood that it will reach $30,000 by the end of this week. 
This push was likely aided by large amounts of older, stagnant coins that were finally moved. According to Santiment’s “Age Consumed” measure, which tracks the average age of cryptocurrencies that are traded, the most dormant BTX has changed wallets since July.

Bitcoin has a history of being used as a hedge against inflation, but its short-term price trajectory is currently hard to predict. There are many market factors that can either send the cryptocurrency up or spiraling downwards. 
One example is the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin applications, which many have hinted could signal the start of a new bull run to new highs. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $27,740 and is looking to cross over $28,000.

This Bullish Divergence Is Once Again Forming For Bitcoin, Rally Soon?;"Data shows a divergence is forming between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s open interest, something that has been bullish for BTC in the past.
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the BTC open interest has been going down since Monday. The “open interest” here refers to the total amount of Bitcoin contracts (in USD) that are currently open on the futures and options market.
When the value of this metric increases, it means that there are more positions being opened up on derivative exchanges right now. Such a trend can lead to increased volatility for the asset, as more positions generally come with higher overall leverage for the sector.
On the other hand, decreasing values suggest the traders are either closing off their positions or are getting liquidated. The cryptocurrency may become calmer following this kind of trend.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the open interest for Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past month:

As displayed in the above graph, The Bitcoin open interest has observed a downtrend in the last few days. This decline in the indicator had first started when the fake iShares ETF announcement led to more than $100 million shorts being flushed in a flash.
The metric saw a bit of a rebound not too long after this sudden sharp liquidation squeeze took place, but it was quick to return back toward a downward trajectory.
At the same time that this latest decline in the Bitcoin open interest has occurred, the Ethereum open interest has registered a rise instead. This suggests that while contracts are closing up on BTC futures and options, the ETH side of the market is seeing renewed interest.
Interestingly, as Santiment has highlighted in the chart, the last time this trend occurred, the Bitcoin price benefited from an uplift. This previous occurrence of the pattern was between September 28 and 30, and shortly after this, the BTC price saw an increase of about 4.5%.
The divergence between the metrics of the two assets was much more pronounced back then as compared to now; however, the scales of both the decline in the BTC open interest and the rise in the ETH open interest were far greater.
Nonetheless, the same general pattern has still repeated this time, so it now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin would see a bullish effect this time as well, and if so, to what degree, given the lesser scale of the divergence.
Bitcoin has gone stale during the last few days as its price is still trading around the $28,400 mark right now.

Bitcoin Price On The Rise, Coinbase Following The Bullish Trend?;"The post Bitcoin Price On The Rise, Coinbase Following The Bullish Trend? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The Bitcoin price has displayed a positive week as the coin has gained over 6% in its value with the last seven trading days. The star crypto has been maintaining a constant uptrend in its charts and has also managed to break out of its key resistance level of $28,000 recently suggesting a possibility of a massive price action in the coming days.
Daan Crypto Trades, a well-known full time crypto trader and investor with a substantial following of 345K+ on the “X” platform, has recently compared the Coinbase price vs the Bitcoin price.
Following the comparison the analyst concluded that the COIN price tends to follow the BTC footsteps as its price is affected in the similar manner as that of Bitcoin.
$COIN Tends to follow $BTC but with a higher beta (moves more).I would assume that if #Bitcoin starts moving up again at some point, that we'd also see COIN making some nice moves. pic.twitter.com/FcZOomomXu
The analyst further assumes that if the price of Bitcoin gains momentum, The COIN price also displays a rise in its graph, and the case remains the same as when the BTC price loses momentum so does the Coinbase coin. Moreover, the analyst expected the Coin price to make some nice moves following the rise in Bitcoin’s price.
Further, the Coinbase has recently announced to locate its headquarters in Ireland as its European crypto hub which could result in a significant price action for the industry in the coming days.
At the time of publishing, the BTC price was trading at $28,436.36. Bitcoin has gained massive momentum in the past week as the buying and selling power has increased significantly. The price has been trading in a consolidated range between $28,129 and $28,513 since three days now.
If the bulls break out of its key resistance at $29,000, the price will make a run toward its resistance level of $29,600. Further, if the market manages to hold the price at that level, the price will continue to rise and retest its $30,000 mark in the coming days.
On the flip side, if the bears overpower the bulls and a trend reversal occurs, the price will lose momentum, resulting in the price to dip toward its support level of $27,763.65 soon.
Moreover, if the BTC price fails to regain power, the price will continue to dip and test its lower support level of $27,403.25 in the coming days.

Solana, XRP and One Ethereum Rival Leading Institutional Inflows in 2023: CoinShares Data;"Digital assets manager CoinShares says XRP, Solana (SOL) and another Ethereum (ETH) rival are being favored by institutional investors in 2023 so far.
In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, CoinShares finds that institutional investors have poured more money into Solana, XRP and Cardano (ADA) this year than any other altcoin, including ETH.
After weekly inflows of $3.7 million for SOL and $0.4 million for XRP (ADA had no recorded inflows) last week, the three altcoins lead all non-ETH altcoins with $59 million, $15 million, and $6 million in inflows, year-to-date, respectively.
Over the same period, Bitcoin (BTC) has raked in $260 million in inflows. Ethereum is currently in the red by $111 million.
Last week, the crypto markets enjoyed their third week of inflows in a row.
“Digital asset investment products saw inflows for the 3rd consecutive week totaling $15 million, although trading volumes remain 27% below the 2023 average. 
A regional divide persists, with continued minimal inflows into the US, while Europe saw net inflows totaling $7 million last week, Sweden being the only country to see outflows.”
CoinShares also notes that XRP has seen 25 weeks in a row of positive inflows from institutions.
“Last week was not positive for altcoins in general, with Tezos, Litecoin and Chainlink seeing outflows totaling $0.25 million, $0.28 million, and $0.31 million respectively. XRP saw modest inflows amounting to $0.42 million. This marks the 25th consecutive week of inflows into XRP this year. 
The consistent inflows underscore the investment community’s support, especially considering successful legal challenges against the SEC.”

Yuga Labs CEO Addresses Community Feedback and Shares Vision for the Future;"Yuga Labs CEO Daniel Alegre reflects on his journey, the importance of community, and the roadmap ahead for Yuga Labs and its various projects.
Daniel Alegre, the CEO of Yuga Labs, recently took to social media to address the feedback and concerns raised by the community. He began by acknowledging the importance of understanding the crypto space and the significance of social communication. Recalling advice from one of Yuga’s founders, Alegre emphasized the value of constructive feedback and the role it plays in shaping the brand’s health.
Alegre has been proactive in immersing himself within the Yuga community. From attending meet-ups in cities like New York, Miami, and Tokyo to interacting with members of BAYC, CryptoPunks, Meebits, and 10KTF, he has made it a priority to understand the diverse perspectives that make up the Yuga family. These interactions have led to initiatives like the Made by Apes program, elevating the CryptoPunks art form, and speeding up the delivery of Otherside through partnerships.
Looking back at his initial days as CEO, Alegre appreciated the unique connections the teams had built within the communities. However, he also recognized the challenges Yuga Labs faced due to its limited staffing. This realization led to a restructuring and refocusing of priorities, emphasizing supporting existing communities, executing on Otherside, and leveraging partnerships.
Alegre expressed his excitement for the upcoming ApeFest and the opportunity to meet many community members. Despite industry challenges, he remains focused on Yuga Labs’ long-term mission of building culture on the blockchain.
In his closing remarks, Alegre thanked the community for their continued support and reiterated Yuga Labs’ commitment to its mission.

Bitcoin Miners Are Failing At SEO: Misinformation Wins;"I love this space. But, as with any large grouping of individual people, there are a few things that I have been discussing that continue to go ignored by much of the space. When it comes to participating in highly competitive arenas it is those participants that see opportunity where waters are undisturbed that will find success. Especially when other participants choose to discount these strategies.
What we will be discussing here are two very basic topics:
That is ⅔ of the world population using the internet. What is your primary use for the internet? Finding information. How do we find that information today?
We turn to search engines. Which search engine in particular? Google.
Google makes up a whopping 78% of all online search traffic. When was the last time that you searched “bitcoin mining” or “hashrate”? — Do your Googles.
The results are abysmal. Frankly embarrassing. Who are the primary “sources” we get through Google for such searches?
Not a single bitcoin miner. Not one. Not on Page 1 nor Page 2 – and that’s already 100% deeper than most people are willing to go on a Google Search. We don’t even get any of the Bitcoin Mining organizations or institutions that claim to be championing the industry! When we google “oil production” or “oil & gas production” we get a mix of varying institutions that monitor the industry as well as the corporations themselves such as Aramco. But when it comes to bitcoin mining we offer zero direction to the average internet surfer, whether that is the CEO of a prospective business or a congressman’s staffer. No wonder nobody is informed, nor wants to be informed! We aren’t helping ourselves at all. 
This poses a massive failure by the industry as a whole. If nearly 2/3 of the global population uses the internet, and 78% of the search traffic is through Google Search and our results are not directing searchers to bitcoin miners or the trusted institutions. We are FAILING. Bitcoin miners need to be positioning themselves as the primary educators and resources for: what is bitcoin mining? how does it work? what is the hardware used (ASICs)? how does the subsidy distribution work? what is SHA-256? and so on.
By positioning themselves to be the primary source of information for gaining understanding, bitcoin miners stand to establish brand awareness through the information-seeking stage of the bitcoin/bitcoin mining rabbithole. Which is the most important and influential moment in any potential bitcoiner’s journey.
Most importantly, it allows prospective clients of a bitcoin miner’s services to gain understanding and weigh-out the potential benefits of integrating bitcoin mining into their current operations.
Secondarily, it allows for each bitcoin miner (should they so choose) to provide their own individual arguments as to the value of bitcoin mining, current market events, and their services rendered. Which is essentially… sales. Hats-off to those of you who identified this is efficient.
Plenty of bitcoin miners, both individual and cooperate, engage in activity on social media platforms like Twitter (it’s not “X” I will never call it “ex” that is such a stupid name for a social platform), but they aren’t driving activity towards their own websites. It’s a lot of peacocking, which is necessary – I get it, but it should be getting directed to their websites where their sites act as the trophy cases. Using a Twitter feed as a trophy case just results in your prizes getting buried under the algorithm. Let alone on the other social mediums like LinkedIn, Instagram, Snapchat, or TikTok. There are metaphorical TONS of reasons why bitcoin miners want attention being driven (through links, post shares, etc.) towards their websites. And there are 10 times as many reasons why our miners should be bragging from “here ‘til Underverse come,” – gold star if you got that reference.
There is an entire ecosystem that is content marketing, SEO, and Google Analytics. What’s more: these strategies take time. Time for the algorithms to identify all of the important metrics towards SEO or digital ad campaigns, to identify things like: what works (keywords), what doesn’t work (negative keywords), and which demographics are the ones searching for our keywords most. Time to refine strategies and approaches to avoid paying the egregious prices that Google suggests from jump. And time to identify what works and what does not. Meaning that the longer bitcoin miners ignore this vector, the more opportunity they give their competitors to establish dominion and take their lunch out from underneath them.
Then there’s the matter of our miners’ websites. Not exactly the prettiest girls at the ball, if you catch my drift. Many are enough to get the job done, and some even provide a good amount of relevant information. But that’s just it, they are enough. But when it comes to all things bitcoin, enough is not enough. We are behooved to seek excellence, in all things. Each individual and each bitcoin company is a representative of this industry, the community’s participants, and of the asset itself. 
All humans are wired to judge the value of an entity (whether it be an individual, a team, or a company) by the manner in which they present themselves. If we aim to hold our world to a higher standard under bitcoin (hell, who am I kidding – a number of higher standards), then we must hold ourselves to higher standards as well. Miners can accomplish much by sprucing up their websites a bit, adjusting fire with regards to how they utilize social media, and using the content of their websites to maximize search engine traffic. It sounds like a lot, and it is, but it is not necessarily an expensive tab. It simply requires individuals that have taken the time to begin to understand how these games are played, and then letting them refine their approach. 
Not taking the time to garner as much online attention as possible will hamstring any, and every, bitcoin miner in the long run. Their most likely competitors that will take this opportunity? Their current partners. More specifically, the partners that are energy producers today, like Exxon, Chevron, Shell, etc. these players have the energy generation already. Once these parties determine they can mine without a third party and they can bring their own in-house technicians, then current miners will begin to lose market share or get acquired. Losing market share is losing power and losing income. Two things that current miners can not afford to lose.
Enough is not enough. Excellence is required.

Shiba Inu Starts Off Strong With An Explosive 233% In SHIB Burn Rate;"The Shiba Inu ecosystem has started out the new week on a particularly positive note. The burn rate, which is a community initiative to reduce the massive supply of the token, has seen a significant jump as the price of the meme coin has recovered.
A Monday report by Shiba Inu burn tracking website Shibburn showed that the SHIB burn rate has seen an impressive 233% climb. This puts a turn on the particularly slow weekend which saw burn rates decline rapidly.
As the new trading week opens up, the total SHIB tokens burned during this time has crossed 56.98 million. This was the result of tokens being sent to the burn address across 29 addresses, with more than 3.7 million tokens sent to the burn address in the last hour as of the time of this writing.

The token burn also led to an increase in the burn rate for the last week as well. Monday’s burn figures saw the weekly burn total rise above 316.7 million. This is a 26% increase in the burn rate compared to the previous seven days.
Some of the largest burns came from the ‘0x909a9’ and ‘0x4be2’ addresses. Both addresses burned a total of 7,119,784 million and 8,095,490 million tokens respectively. The total comes out to over 15 million tokens, accounting for around 27% of the total burns for the day.

On Sunday, the price of Bitcoin surged toward the $28,000 level, and in response, the rest of the crypto market followed the flagship cryptocurrency. Shiba Inu was no different and finally saw a reversal in its bull stretch since the month began.
Shiba Inu rose around 1.24% in the 24-hour period and although this is not as impressive as some of the recoveries mounted by other assets, it has helped the cryptocurrency to secure its support at $0.000007. This gives bulls some wiggle room as they regain their bearings in the market.
However, Shiba Inu is still seeing small losses of 0.59% on the weekly chart. This suggests that the bulls’ hold on the asset is weak and bears could regain control if momentum slips. This battle for control is mirrored by the daily trading volume of the crypto which is up 25.85% and sitting at $101.7 million, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
So far, there doesn’t seem to be any special event pushing the price of SHIB besides the Bitcoin recovery. Given this, if the Bitcoin rally ends, then SHIB will most likely follow and fall into losses again.

Bitcoin Slides 6% After Failing to Break $29,900 But Remains Bullish in This Channel, While Bitcoin Minetrix Continues to Rise;"Bitcoin (BTC) is down by 5% from the week’s high set at $29,900, as it currently sits at the $28,250 level.

A false report that a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF had been approved caused the asset’s price to surge 10% in minutes, allowing it to reach the July 2021 low-day closing price of $29,900.
Despite its 5% drop, Bitcoin remains bullish inside a rising price channel.
As Bitcoin (BTC) remains uncertain, newly emerging Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) gains popularity as the cloud-based mining service raises $1.75 million in just over two weeks.
Bitcoin saw a rollercoaster trading week as a false news report caused the asset to spike as high as $29,900.
The false report, released on X by CoinTelegraph, stated that the SEC approved the BlackRock iShares spot Bitcoin ETF.

Although false, the report spread like wildfire, causing Bitcoin to surge by over 10% as it skyrocketed into the July 2021 low-day closing price.
CoinTelegraph deleted the post and issued an apology. BlackRock also stated that the report was entirely false.
Following the clarification, Bitcoin started to pull back but remains bullish in a rising price channel.
Although Bitcoin is now retracing, the asset remains bullish within the confines of the following price channel;

During the week, Bitcoin spiked as high as $29,900 (July 2021 LDC) but has since reversed to the current $29,250 level.
Looking ahead, the first level of support lies at $28,225. This is followed by $28,000, $27,750 (Jan 2021 lows), $27,500 (lower angle of the channel), and $27,000.
On the other side, resistance lies at $28,650 (June 2021 lows), $29,000, $29,350 (July 2021 lows), and $29,900.
While Bitcoin continues its whipsaw-like price movements, traders are looking for alternative projects capable of producing magnificent returns in the meantime.
One project catching the crypto community’s attention is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), which has raised over $1.75 million in just over two weeks.
Investors are rushing to this newly-emerging token due to its stake-to-mine concept, which could overhaul the problematic cloud-based mining sector.

Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) has raised almost $1.8 million in just over two weeks.
The project is introducing a novel stake-to-mine concept allowing users to stake BTCMTX tokens to access its cloud mining platform.
Users buy and stake BTCMTX to earn Mining Credits, which can be burnt in exchange for cloud-mining time.
As a result, investors earn double the passive income as the project combines two of the hottest trends in the industry: staking and cloud mining.
Stakers are currently earning an impressive 330% APY on their assets at the time of writing.

The presale’s speedy growth demonstrates investors’ confidence in Bitcoin Minetrix to revolutionize the cloud mining sector.
Cloud mining allows regular users to mine BTC without owning or maintaining expensive mining equipment.
Instead, users can simply rent a portion of the computational power in dedicated mining centers and start earning BTC.
However, all cloud mining solutions today are centralized, resulting in users paying large cash deposits for long-term contracts and being left short on their potential earnings due to a lack of transparency.
Bitcoin Minetrix aims to change this dynamic.

The stake-to-mine ecosystem is entirely decentralized and is automatically managed through audited smart contracts, which transparently allocate earnings.
The tokenization of the process ensures that end-users ultimately control their funds at every step.
Users never have to give up custody of their assets and are free to unstake and sell their BTCMTX tokens at any time, providing complete flexibility.
Some big-name influencers in the space are starting to endorse BTCMTX as a potentially disruptive force in the cloud mining sector, showing the building hype behind the project.
The Telegram community for the project is also seeing significant growth, demonstrating its snowballing popularity.
The presale is currently selling the BTCMTX token for $0.011.
However, there’s a rising pricing structure that will see the price of the token increase by 10% in the next presale stage – scheduled for four days from now.
Therefore, those that get positioned earliest benefit the most as they get to enter at a lower price level.
Overall, with its groundbreaking tokenization of the cloud mining space, Bitcoin Minetrix has the potential to deliver substantial returns as the market anticipates the next Bitcoin block halving.

Amid market turbulence, OKX and Bitstamp reflect Bitcoin’s volatile exchange climate;"In the face of contemporary geopolitical instability and market unpredictability, Bitcoin exchanges are experiencing intense volatility in their inflows and outflows.
OKX Exchange, for instance, yesterday, Oct. 18, saw the largest Bitcoin inflow in almost three years, with approximately 8,000 Bitcoin valued at around $224 million.
Interestingly, this significant inflow is the largest since Nov. 2020, a period that also coincided with OKX’s largest outflow in the past three years. This simultaneous event of large inflows and outflows draws attention to Nov. 2020 as the inception of the previous cycle’s bull run.
Presently, OKX holds a year-to-date high of approximately 143,000 Bitcoin, the most since January 2021.
Conversely, Bitstamp Exchange has witnessed the largest outflow in over a year, with about 5,000 Bitcoins, equivalent to approximately $140 million. Currently, Bitstamp has about 40,000 Bitcoins on their platform, the lowest level since 2013.
These contrasting observations underscore not only the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin exchanges but also the divergent strategies of individual platforms amidst the ongoing market volatility.

This Gaming Giant Now Accept’s Ripple (XRP) as a Payment Method;"TL;DR
Ripple’s native token – XRP – has been the subject of mass adoption recently, with numerous companies allowing clients to pay for services in it instead of fiat. The latest entity to embrace the asset is the California-based video game giant Xsolla. 
It announced that customers can use XRP to purchase the popular games Smite and Roblox and “enjoy gaming like never before.” The offering was introduced after a collaboration between Xsolla and the cryptocurrency payment application BitPay.

Ripple’s partial court victory against the US SEC in mid-July has infused optimism in the cryptocurrency space and positively affected XRP. The token spiked by over 70% in the hours after the ruling, surpassing the $0.85.
And while it couldn’t keep the momentum, the win granted it appraisal from numerous leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Crypto.com, Coinbase, Kraken, and others re-listed XRP after withdrawing their support at the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021 (shortly after America’s securities regulator filed a lawsuit against the blockchain enterprise).
The asset has also become the most traded alternative coin in the US and one of the most popular alternatives to Bitcoin (BTC).
According to multiple analysts and experts, XRP has a chance for a future price rally, while Ripple seems to be one step away from securing a decisive win against its enemy. Those willing to find out how the token could perform in the remaining months of 2023 could take a look at our video:

Bitcoin: Will the U.S. Government Sell its $5.4 Billion BTC Holding?;"The U.S. government has one of the biggest Bitcoin (BTC) holdings in the world. Till now, the United States has amassed about 200,000 BTC from cybercriminals and darknet markets.  The value of the holdings is about $5.4 billion. If sold, it could cause the markets to fall into utter chaos. This is especially worrisome, given that the U.S. government is not concerned about the crypto market. 
According to a Wall Street Journal report, the U.S. government is not holding its Bitcoin (BTC), nor is it waiting for its value to go higher. The BTC in the government’s coffers is stuck in a lengthy legal process.

According to Jarod Koopman, executive director of the IRS’s cyber and forensics services section, “We don’t play the market. We basically are set by the timing in our process.” 
If the U.S. government sells its Bitcoin holding, the markets will likely bleed. Investors would begin to panic and BTC’s value will most likely plummet. However, the legal procedure for getting approval for the government to sell its BTC holdings is very lengthy.

When a government agency gets its hands on seized digital assets, it does not mean that the government gets ownership right away. It is only after a court issues a final forfeiture order does the government gets ownership of the assets. After the forfeiture order, the seized assets are sent to the U.S. Marshals Service, which is responsible for liquidating seized assets. 
According to Nicolas Christin, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, “The government moves generally very slowly to dispose of those assets because they’ve got to do a ton of due diligence, the cases are often complicated and there’s a lot of red tape.” 
Earlier this year the U.S. government sold about $215 million worth of BTC seized from the Silk Road marketplace. Furthermore, it was revealed that the government planned to sell another 41,490 BTC worth a whopping $1.1 billion.

Coinbase Trading Volume Takes a Hit Amid Ongoing Crypto Winter;"The post Coinbase Trading Volume Takes a Hit Amid Ongoing Crypto Winter appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
Coinbase (COIN), the titan of cryptocurrency exchanges, is grappling with challenges on multiple fronts. New data from Berenberg Capital Markets suggests that the platform’s trading volumes in the U.S. have plunged significantly, down 17% sequentially and a whopping 52% year-over-year. This downturn arrives just as Coinbase gears up to unveil its third-quarter earnings on November 2.
Coinbase’s hiccups aren’t confined to declining trading volumes. Berenberg analysts, led by Mark Palmer, caution that regulatory threats loom large for the company, which has been embroiled in various legal disputes in the United States. If that weren’t enough, Coinbase’s lobbying ambitions for friendlier crypto regulations face complications due to recent headlines about Hamas’ use of cryptocurrencies.
“Recent actions by Hamas could potentially torpedo Coinbase’s lobbying efforts,” says Palmer. 
The geopolitical issues, particularly concerning Israel and Hamas, have escalated the scrutiny on cryptocurrency’s legal status. This comes after Israeli authorities froze over 100 crypto accounts suspected of aiding Hamas.
Despite what some call a “crypto winter” and the pile-up of regulatory headaches, Coinbase shares are far from crashing. At last check, the stock was trading at $77.30, up 3% for the day, and a striking 112% up for the year. This compares favorably with Bitcoin’s 72% year-to-date gain and Nasdaq’s 29% uptick.
Berenberg analysts hold a “cautious” outlook on Coinbase, maintaining their “hold” rating and a $39 price target on the stock. Interestingly, Palmer warns against shorting the stock outright. “COIN is a crowded short. The stock is uninvestable in the near term but could experience abrupt upside moves as it fights through its legal challenges with the SEC,” he states.
The road ahead appears thorny for Coinbase, with Palmer indicating that the SEC case could continue to be an “overhang” for the stock. However, the company’s large cash reserves and potential for cost-cutting manoeuvres might provide a safety net in turbulent times.

How Could Bitcoin Join the $120 Trillion Mutual Fund Industry?;"The potential integration of Bitcoin into the mutual fund industry marks a significant juncture in the world of finance. This development has far-reaching implications, not only for the cryptocurrency market but also for traditional investments. Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has emerged as a formidable contender in the financial landscape. With an estimated $120 trillion under management in the mutual fund industry, Bitcoin’s entry opens new opportunities and challenges.
This synergy between Bitcoin and mutual funds could democratize access to cryptocurrencies, allowing a broader range of investors to participate in the digital revolution. It bridges the gap between the established investment world and the evolving realm of cryptocurrencies. This article delves into the intricacies of this transformative convergence, exploring how it could reshape the future of investment portfolios.
Cryptocurrency mutual funds are financial instruments designed to expose investors to cryptocurrencies’ dynamic and rapidly evolving world. It’s essential to grasp the concept of mutual funds to understand these innovative funds.
Mutual funds are professionally managed investment portfolios that pool funds from various investors to purchase a diversified range of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or other securities. The primary goal of mutual funds is to spread risk through diversification. Investing in various assets aims to reduce the impact of poor performance in any single investment, ultimately providing investors with a more stable and balanced portfolio.
Cryptocurrency mutual funds follow the same principle but specialize in cryptocurrencies and assets linked to the cryptocurrency market. Instead of holding digital coins, these funds typically invest in cryptocurrency futures contracts. These contracts enable investors to speculate on the price movements of cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. This approach allows cryptocurrency mutual funds to adhere to regulatory requirements and security protocols while exposing investors to the crypto market’s potential for growth.
Cryptocurrency mutual funds have faced numerous formidable challenges, primarily driven by regulatory hurdles. These funds have encountered significant roadblocks in the United States, largely due to concerns raised by regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
As the main regulatory authority overseeing investment products, the SEC has been cautious about approving cryptocurrency mutual funds. They have expressed concerns about the cryptocurrency market’s inherent characteristics, such as its susceptibility to fraud, extreme volatility, and limited investor protections. These concerns have led to stringent regulations to safeguard investors and maintain market integrity.
As a result of these regulatory concerns, U.S. investors have limited options when it comes to cryptocurrency mutual funds. The SEC has discouraged many fund providers from offering direct exposure to cryptocurrencies, prompting them to explore alternative routes, such as futures-based funds. Consequently, the choice of crypto mutual funds remains restricted for investors seeking a diversified and regulated entry point into the crypto market.
The Bitcoin Strategy ProFund is the pioneering cryptocurrency mutual fund accessible to U.S. investors. Launched in July 2021, it signifies a significant step in bridging the gap between traditional mutual funds and the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market.
This unique fund adopts a strategy centered on Bitcoin futures contracts. Rather than directly holding Bitcoin, it leverages futures to track the performance of the world’s most renowned cryptocurrency. Doing so aims to provide investors with an avenue to participate in Bitcoin’s price movements without owning the digital asset.
For those interested in entering the Bitcoin Strategy ProFund, a minimum investment of $1,000 is required. Additionally, the fund comes with an expense ratio of 1.15%, a cost that covers the management and operational expenses associated with the fund.
Cryptocurrency mutual funds, cryptocurrency trusts, and cryptocurrency ETFs are distinct investment options with unique characteristics and objectives.
Cryptocurrency mutual funds, like the Bitcoin Strategy ProFund, invest in futures contracts tied to cryptocurrencies, indirectly exposing investors to the digital asset’s price movements. In contrast, cryptocurrency trusts are investment vehicles that directly hold cryptocurrencies. Companies like Grayscale offer these trusts and include offerings like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which holds Bitcoin.
While both aim to simplify cryptocurrency investments, they differ in several key aspects. Cryptocurrency mutual funds rely on futures contracts, which may not entirely mirror the price movements of the underlying cryptocurrency. In contrast, cryptocurrency trusts own the assets, correlating more directly with cryptocurrency prices.
Cryptocurrency ETFs, like the ProShare Bitcoin Strategy ETF, share similarities with cryptocurrency mutual funds regarding investing in futures contracts. However, the primary distinction lies in their pricing and trading mechanisms.
Cryptocurrency mutual funds are priced once per trading day, ensuring that all investors entering or exiting the fund during that trading day receive the same price. In contrast, cryptocurrency ETFs, as their name suggests, are traded on exchanges like stocks, with fluctuating share prices throughout the trading day. The timing of a trade affects the price investors pay for an ETF.
Ease of Purchase: Cryptocurrency mutual funds offer a convenient gateway for investors to enter the cryptocurrency market. Unlike directly purchasing cryptocurrencies, which may require accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges, investors can buy these funds through standard brokerage accounts, streamlining the investment process.
Diversification Benefits: Mutual funds inherently provide diversification by pooling investors’ money to acquire various assets. While the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, these funds aim to spread risk across a range of cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency-related assets. This diversification can help mitigate the impact of extreme price swings associated with individual cryptocurrencies.
Potential for High Returns: The cryptocurrency market has gained a reputation for rapid price appreciation. Investing in cryptocurrency mutual funds allows investors to benefit from the market’s growth without needing deep technical expertise or direct cryptocurrency ownership. As the market continues to evolve, these funds may capture significant returns.
Limited Options: Currently, the options for cryptocurrency mutual funds available to U.S. investors are limited. Regulatory challenges and concerns have constrained the development of these funds. As a result, investors have only a handful of choices, primarily focusing on Bitcoin futures contracts.
Cryptocurrency Market Volatility: While cryptocurrency investments offer the potential for high returns, they also expose investors to substantial volatility. The crypto market’s price fluctuations can be swift and severe, leading to substantial gains or losses. Even with diversification, the inherent market risk remains.
Relatively High Expense Ratios: Expense ratios for cryptocurrency mutual funds can be relatively high compared to traditional mutual funds. For example, the Bitcoin Strategy ProFund charges an expense ratio of 1.15%. This fee is considered high in the mutual fund industry, potentially impacting investors’ overall returns.
The regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrency investments in the United States has been characterized by evolution and cautious scrutiny. Central to this landscape is the stance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which oversees securities markets and investments. The SEC’s approach to cryptocurrencies has evolved, reflecting the need to balance fostering innovation and safeguarding investors.
The SEC’s acceptance of futures-based cryptocurrency funds, like the ProShare Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), reflects a regulatory preference for instruments that are based on futures contracts traded on established commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). These funds aim to track cryptocurrency price movements through futures contracts, offering regulatory oversight and surveillance.
In contrast, the SEC has been cautious about approving funds directly purchasing cryptocurrencies. Concerns about custody, security, and market manipulation have influenced the SEC’s reluctance. The SEC has cited the potential for fraud and market manipulation to deny some cryptocurrency-based ETF applications, emphasizing the need for robust investor protections.
Bitcoin is poised to play a more prominent role in the mutual fund industry as it gains wider acceptance and the regulatory landscape evolves. This transition marks a significant step towards the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.
A more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrency mutual funds could catalyze Bitcoin’s integration into traditional investment vehicles. If regulatory agencies like the SEC continue to embrace futures-based cryptocurrency funds and work towards enhancing investor protections, it may encourage more fund managers to offer cryptocurrency-based options.
Looking ahead, diversification strategies within cryptocurrency mutual funds may expand beyond Bitcoin. While Bitcoin remains the flagship cryptocurrency, the growing diversity of cryptocurrencies, often referred to as altcoins, presents opportunities for broader investment strategies. Fund managers may explore cryptocurrencies to spread risk and capture the potential of emerging projects.
As the cryptocurrency market matures and becomes more transparent, investor confidence in this asset class will likely grow. This increased confidence could pave the way for more traditional investors to allocate a portion of their portfolios to cryptocurrency mutual funds, further integrating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into the broader investment landscape.
Cryptocurrency Trusts: For investors seeking an alternative to cryptocurrency mutual funds, cryptocurrency trusts offer a viable option. These trusts, such as those offered by Grayscale, provide exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Investors purchase shares in the trust, which holds the corresponding amount of cryptocurrency. While trusts are user-friendly, they often come with higher fees, typically around 2% to 2.5% annually. However, they provide direct ownership of cryptocurrencies, aligning with the ethos of decentralization.
Cryptocurrency ETFs: Cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are another choice for those interested in digital assets. ETFs, like the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF and Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF, aim to track the performance of cryptocurrencies through futures contracts. They are known for lower expense ratios than mutual funds and trusts, typically below 1%. However, ETFs differ from mutual funds in terms of pricing and trading; ETF shares are traded on exchanges and have prices that fluctuate throughout the trading day.
The potential for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to make a significant foray into the mutual fund industry is a topic of growing interest. Cryptocurrency mutual funds represent a novel way for investors to gain exposure to the volatile yet promising world of digital assets. They offer convenience, diversification, and the possibility of substantial returns.
However, this emerging sector is not without its challenges. Regulatory hurdles, particularly those imposed by the U.S. SEC, have limited the options available to U.S. investors. Concerns about fraud, volatility, and investor protection have contributed to the cautious approach taken by regulatory bodies.
Despite these obstacles, the Bitcoin Strategy ProFund emerged as the first publicly available cryptocurrency mutual fund for U.S. investors, focusing on futures contracts. While this fund offers an entry point, it is essential to recognize that options for a diversified mix of cryptocurrencies are still evolving.
Looking ahead, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency investments is dynamic, with the SEC showing receptiveness to futures-based cryptocurrency funds. The potential for a more diverse range of cryptocurrency mutual funds becomes more plausible as the regulatory environment matures. Investors should stay informed about these developments and carefully assess risk tolerance when exploring investment options in this rapidly evolving space. Cryptocurrency mutual funds, alongside trusts and ETFs, present intriguing possibilities for those intrigued by the potential of digital assets within their investment portfolios.

The potential integration of Bitcoin into the mutual fund industry marks a significant juncture in the world of finance. This development has far-reaching implications, not only for the cryptocurrency market but also for traditional investments. Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has emerged as a formidable contender in the financial landscape. With an estimated $120 trillion under management in the mutual fund industry, Bitcoin’s entry opens new opportunities and challenges.
This synergy between Bitcoin and mutual funds could democratize access to cryptocurrencies, allowing a broader range of investors to participate in the digital revolution. It bridges the gap between the established investment world and the evolving realm of cryptocurrencies. This article delves into the intricacies of this transformative convergence, exploring how it could reshape the future of investment portfolios.
Cryptocurrency mutual funds are financial instruments designed to expose investors to cryptocurrencies’ dynamic and rapidly evolving world. It’s essential to grasp the concept of mutual funds to understand these innovative funds.
Mutual funds are professionally managed investment portfolios that pool funds from various investors to purchase a diversified range of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or other securities. The primary goal of mutual funds is to spread risk through diversification. Investing in various assets aims to reduce the impact of poor performance in any single investment, ultimately providing investors with a more stable and balanced portfolio.
Cryptocurrency mutual funds follow the same principle but specialize in cryptocurrencies and assets linked to the cryptocurrency market. Instead of holding digital coins, these funds typically invest in cryptocurrency futures contracts. These contracts enable investors to speculate on the price movements of cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. This approach allows cryptocurrency mutual funds to adhere to regulatory requirements and security protocols while exposing investors to the crypto market’s potential for growth.
Cryptocurrency mutual funds have faced numerous formidable challenges, primarily driven by regulatory hurdles. These funds have encountered significant roadblocks in the United States, largely due to concerns raised by regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
As the main regulatory authority overseeing investment products, the SEC has been cautious about approving cryptocurrency mutual funds. They have expressed concerns about the cryptocurrency market’s inherent characteristics, such as its susceptibility to fraud, extreme volatility, and limited investor protections. These concerns have led to stringent regulations to safeguard investors and maintain market integrity.
As a result of these regulatory concerns, U.S. investors have limited options when it comes to cryptocurrency mutual funds. The SEC has discouraged many fund providers from offering direct exposure to cryptocurrencies, prompting them to explore alternative routes, such as futures-based funds. Consequently, the choice of crypto mutual funds remains restricted for investors seeking a diversified and regulated entry point into the crypto market.
The Bitcoin Strategy ProFund is the pioneering cryptocurrency mutual fund accessible to U.S. investors. Launched in July 2021, it signifies a significant step in bridging the gap between traditional mutual funds and the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market.
This unique fund adopts a strategy centered on Bitcoin futures contracts. Rather than directly holding Bitcoin, it leverages futures to track the performance of the world’s most renowned cryptocurrency. Doing so aims to provide investors with an avenue to participate in Bitcoin’s price movements without owning the digital asset.
For those interested in entering the Bitcoin Strategy ProFund, a minimum investment of $1,000 is required. Additionally, the fund comes with an expense ratio of 1.15%, a cost that covers the management and operational expenses associated with the fund.
Cryptocurrency mutual funds, cryptocurrency trusts, and cryptocurrency ETFs are distinct investment options with unique characteristics and objectives.
Cryptocurrency mutual funds, like the Bitcoin Strategy ProFund, invest in futures contracts tied to cryptocurrencies, indirectly exposing investors to the digital asset’s price movements. In contrast, cryptocurrency trusts are investment vehicles that directly hold cryptocurrencies. Companies like Grayscale offer these trusts and include offerings like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which holds Bitcoin.
While both aim to simplify cryptocurrency investments, they differ in several key aspects. Cryptocurrency mutual funds rely on futures contracts, which may not entirely mirror the price movements of the underlying cryptocurrency. In contrast, cryptocurrency trusts own the assets, correlating more directly with cryptocurrency prices.
Cryptocurrency ETFs, like the ProShare Bitcoin Strategy ETF, share similarities with cryptocurrency mutual funds regarding investing in futures contracts. However, the primary distinction lies in their pricing and trading mechanisms.
Cryptocurrency mutual funds are priced once per trading day, ensuring that all investors entering or exiting the fund during that trading day receive the same price. In contrast, cryptocurrency ETFs, as their name suggests, are traded on exchanges like stocks, with fluctuating share prices throughout the trading day. The timing of a trade affects the price investors pay for an ETF.
Ease of Purchase: Cryptocurrency mutual funds offer a convenient gateway for investors to enter the cryptocurrency market. Unlike directly purchasing cryptocurrencies, which may require accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges, investors can buy these funds through standard brokerage accounts, streamlining the investment process.
Diversification Benefits: Mutual funds inherently provide diversification by pooling investors’ money to acquire various assets. While the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, these funds aim to spread risk across a range of cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency-related assets. This diversification can help mitigate the impact of extreme price swings associated with individual cryptocurrencies.

Solana, XRP, and Cardano Attract Institutional Investors;"The post Solana, XRP, and Cardano Attract Institutional Investors appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News
The crypto market is off to a strong start this week, surging over 2.5% in value. After a bearish spell, cryptocurrencies show signs of stability, hinting at a potential bullish end of the month for Bitcoin and altcoins. 2023 Sees Big Bucks Flowing into Solana, XRP, and Cardano (ADA) – Leaving ETH in the Dust, reports CoinShares. These altcoins have emerged as top picks, reflecting a shifting trend in the crypto market. 
Meanwhile, institutional investors are reshaping the cryptocurrency craze in 2023, with Solana (SOL) emerging as a standout choice, drawing $3.7 million in weekly inflows. Despite a recent 9% dip in value, Solana’s appeal to institutions is undeniable. 
XRP is proving its mettle with an extraordinary streak of 25 consecutive weeks of positive inflows, showcasing its resilience in the face of legal challenges. Cardano (ADA) is also garnering attention with $6 million in institutional inflows. These three cryptocurrencies have collectively amassed $59 million, $15 million, and $6 million in inflows year-to-date, solidifying their position as favored choices among institutional investors. 
Undoubtedly, this trend signifies growing institutional confidence in the potential of these digital assets, even amidst market fluctuations. While Solana’s recent institutional interest hasn’t led to an immediate surge in market prices, it underscores the nuanced nature of cryptocurrency investment. Various factors influence the market, and short-term volatility may not necessarily reflect long-term investment potential.
Additionally, the data reveals a noticeable regional divide in institutional investment patterns. While the US sees steady but modest inflows, Europe enjoyed net inflows of $7 million last week, with Sweden being the only exception, experiencing outflows. This divide underscores the varying levels of institutional adoption across different regions.
Plus, it highlights a regional disparity in institutional investment trends. While the US continues to see modest inflows, Europe enjoyed net inflows of $7 million last week, with Sweden being the lone exception, experiencing outflows. XRP’s extraordinary streak is particularly noteworthy, boasting 25 consecutive weeks of positive inflows from institutions. 
XRP’s recent legal win favors the coin, though not much change is noticed in price, yet it is one of the tough competitors of Bitcoin. Conversely, Bitcoin continues to attract investments, with $43 million flowing in. However, some are betting against it, putting $1.2 million into “short” positions, banking on a price drop. 
Currently, Bitcoin stands at $27,600, showing a slight two percent dip.
